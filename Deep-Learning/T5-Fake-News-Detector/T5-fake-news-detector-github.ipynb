       "33    st century wire says \\nwire reported on friday about the fbis surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiners newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation will this really yield anything significant in the  days runningup to the nov th election or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors it seems that washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action \\nafter comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control \\nelite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton \\ncertainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week \\nnote despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell \\nsee also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice \\nthe fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state \\nzero hedge adds \\nnow it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over \\nhere is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey \\nwatch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server \\n read more election news at st century wire  files \\nsupport wire  subscribe  become a member wiretv

       "34    in a stunning turn of events  days before the  presidential election the fbi announced it is reopenning its investigation into hillary clintons email server case by probing newly emerging emails linked to hillary clinton \\nnew probe the fbi gives hillary clinton a second look photo illustraion wire \\nfbi october surprise \\naccording to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server \\ncnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation \\nin previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote \\nin connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added \\nalthough the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded \\nhumas estranged sexting husband \\naccording to a new report released via the new york times  \\nthe presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled \\nthis unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years \\nthe following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation \\nthe new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week \\nthe political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  \\nthe report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe \\nthe money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau \\nin a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request \\nthe newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face \\nit remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election \\nmore from rt below\n",
