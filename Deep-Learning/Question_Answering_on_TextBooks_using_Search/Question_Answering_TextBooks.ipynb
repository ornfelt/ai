By the late 1990s, data telecommunications had\\nbeen opened by the expansion of the Internet. Prices plummeted. New and innovative\\ntechnologies, services, and companies emerged. Meanwhile, the work of free software\\npioneers like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and countless others was culminating\\nin the creation of a truly open software platform called Linux (or GNU/Linux). However, voice communications, ubiquitous as they were, remained proprietary. Why?\\nPerhaps it was because voice on the old public telephone network lacked the glamor\\nand promise of the shiny new World Wide Web. Or, perhaps it was because a telephone\\njust wasn\\'t as effective at supplying adult entertainment. Whatever the reason, one\\nthing was clear. Open source voice communications was about as widespread as open\\nsource copy protection software.\\nNecessity (and in some cases simply being cheap) is truly the mother of invention. In\\n1999, having started Linux Support Services to offer free and commercial technical\\nsupport for Linux, I found myself in need (or at least in perceived need) of a phone\\nsystem to assist me in providing 24-hour technical support. The idea was that people\\nwould be able to call in, enter their customer identity, and leave a message. The system\\nwould in turn page a technician to respond to the customer\\'s request in short order.\\nSince I had started the company with about $4,000 of capital, I was in no position to\\nbe able to afford a phone system of the sort that I needed to implement this scenario.\\nHaving already been a Linux user since 1994, and having already gotten my feet wet in\\nopen source software development by starting l2tpd, Gaim, and cheops, and in the\\ncomplete absence of anyone having explained the complexity of such a task, I decided\\nthat I would simply make my own phone system using hardware borrowed from\\nxi\\n\\x0cAdtran, where I had worked as a co-op student. Once I got a call into a PC, I fantasized,\\nI could do anything with it. In fact, it is from this conjecture that the official Asterisk\\nmotto (which any sizable, effective project must have) is derived:\\nIt\\'s only software!\\n\\nFor better or worse, I rarely think small. Right from the start, it was my intent that\\nAsterisk would do everything related to telephony. The name \"Asterisk\" was chosen\\nbecause it was both a key on a standard telephone and also the wildcard symbol in\\nLinux (e.g., rm -rf *).\\nSo, in 1999, I had a free telephony platform I\\'d put out on the Web and I went about\\nmy business trying to eke out a living at providing Linux technical support. However,\\nby 2001, as the economy was tanking, it became apparent that Linux Support Services\\nmight do better by pursuing Asterisk than general-purpose Linux technical support.\\nThat year, we would make contact with Jim \"Dude\" Dixon of the Zapata Telephony\\nproject. Dude\\'s exciting work was a fantastic companion to Asterisk and provided a\\nbusiness model for us to start pursuing Asterisk with more focus. After creating our\\nfirst PCI telephony interface card in conjunction with Dude, it became clear that \"Linux\\nSupport Services\" was not the best name for a telephony company, and so we changed\\nthe name to \"Digium,\" which is a whole other story that cannot be effectively conveyed\\nin writing. Enter the expansion of Voice over IP (VoIP) with its disruptive transition of\\nvoice from the old, circuit-switched networks to new IP-based networks, and things\\nreally started to take hold.\\nNow, as we\\'ve already covered, clearly most people don\\'t get very excited about telephones. Certainly, few people could share my excitement the moment I heard a dial\\ntone coming from a phone connected to my PC. However, those who do get excited\\nabout telephones get really excited about telephones. And facilitated by the Internet,\\nthis small group of people were now able to unite and apply our bizarre passions to a\\ncommon, practical project for the betterment of many.\\nTo say that telecom was ripe for an open source solution would be an immeasurable\\nunderstatement. Telecom is an enormous market due to the ubiquity of telephones in\\nwork and personal life. The direct market for telecom products has a highly technical\\naudience that is willing and able to contribute. People demand their telecom solutions\\nbe infinitely customizable. Proprietary telecom is very expensive. Creating Asterisk was\\nsimply the spark in this fuel-rich backdrop.\\nAsterisk sits at the apex of a variety of transitions (proprietary  open source; circuit\\nswitched  VoIP; voice only  voice, video, and data; digital signal processing  host\\nmedia processing; centralized directory  peer to peer) while easing those transitions\\nby providing bridges back to the older ways of doing things. Asterisk can talk to anything from a 1960s-era pulse-dial phone to the latest wireless VoIP devices, and provide\\nfeatures from simple tandem switching all the way to Bluetooth presence and DUNDi.\\nMost important of all, though, Asterisk demonstrates how a community of motivated\\npeople and companies can work together to create a project with a scope so significant\\nxii | Foreword\\n\\x0cthat no one person or company could have possibly created it on its own. In making\\nAsterisk possible, I particularly would like to thank Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman,\\nthe entire Asterisk community, and whoever invented Red Bull.\\nSo where is Asterisk going from here? Think about the history of the PC. When it was\\nfirst introduced in 1980, it had fairly limited capabilities. Maybe you could do a spreadsheet, maybe do some word processing, but in the end, not much. Over time, however,\\nits open architecture led to price reductions and new products allowing it to slowly\\nexpand its applications, eventually displacing the mini computer, then the mainframe.\\nNow, even Cray supercomputers are built using Linux-based x86 architectures. I anticipate that Asterisk\\'s future will look very similar. Today, there is a large subset of\\ntelephony that is served by Asterisk. Tomorrow, who knows what the limit might be?\\nSo, what are you waiting for? Read, learn, and participate in the future of open telecommunications by joining the Asterisk revolution!\\n--Mark Spencer\\n\\nForeword | xiii\\n\\x0c\\x0cPreface\\n\\nThis is a book for anyone who is new to AsteriskTM.\\nAsterisk is an open source, converged telephony platform, which is designed primarily\\nto run on Linux. Asterisk combines more than 100 years of telephony knowledge into\\na robust suite of tightly integrated telecommunications applications. The power of Asterisk lies in its customizable nature, complemented by unmatched standards compliance. No other PBX can be deployed in so many creative ways.\\nApplications such as voicemail, hosted conferencing, call queuing and agents, music\\non hold, and call parking are all standard features built right into the software. Moreover, Asterisk can integrate with other business technologies in ways that closed,\\nproprietary PBXes can scarcely dream of.\\nAsterisk can appear quite daunting and complex to a new user, which is why documentation is so important to its growth. Documentation lowers the barrier to entry and\\nhelps people contemplate the possibilities.\\nProduced with the generous support of O\\'Reilly Media, Asterisk:\\nThe Future of Telephony was inspired by the work started by the Asterisk Documentation Project. We have come a long way, and this book is the realization of a desire to\\ndeliver documentation that introduces the most fundamental elements of Asterisk--\\nthe things someone new to Asterisk needs to know. It is the first volume in what we\\nare certain will become a huge library of knowledge relating to Asterisk.\\nThis book was written for, and by, the Asterisk community.\\n\\nAudience\\nThis book is for those new to Asterisk, but we assume that you\\'re familiar with basic\\nLinux administration, networking, and other IT disciplines. If not, we encourage you\\nto explore the vast and wonderful library of books that O\\'Reilly publishes on these\\nsubjects. We also assume you\\'re fairly new to telecommunications, both traditional\\nswitched telephony and the new world of Voice over IP.\\n\\nxv\\n\\x0cOrganization\\nThe book is organized into these chapters:\\nChapter 1, A Telephony Revolution\\nThis is where we chop up the kindling and light the fire. Asterisk is going to change\\nthe world of telecom, and this is where we discuss our reasons for that belief.\\nChapter 2, Preparing a System for Asterisk\\nCovers some of the engineering considerations you should have in mind when\\ndesigning a telecommunications system. Much of this material can be skipped if\\nyou want to get right to installing, but these are important concepts to understand,\\nshould you ever plan on putting an Asterisk system into production.\\nChapter 3, Installing Asterisk\\nCovers the obtaining, compiling, and installation of Asterisk.\\nChapter 4, Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\nDescribes the initial configuration of Asterisk. Here we will cover the important\\nconfiguration files that must exist to define the channels and features available to\\nyour system.\\nChapter 5, Dialplan Basics\\nIntroduces the heart of Asterisk, the dialplan.\\nChapter 6, More Dialplan Concepts\\nGoes over some more advanced dialplan concepts.\\nChapter 7, Understanding Telephony\\nTaking a break from Asterisk, this chapter discusses some of the more important\\ntechnologies in use in the Public Telephone Network.\\nChapter 8, Protocols for VoIP\\nFollowing the discussion of legacy telephony, this chapter discusses Voice over\\nInternet Protocol.\\nChapter 9, The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\nIntroduces one of the more amazing components, the Asterisk Gateway Interface.\\nUsing Perl, PHP, and Python, we demonstrate how external programs can be used\\nto add nearly limitless functionality to your PBX.\\nChapter 10, Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\nDescribes how external applications can connect to Asterisk to manipulate or\\nmonitor various aspects of the system. Also included in this chapter is a gentle\\nintroduction to the Adhearsion framework.\\nChapter 11, The Asterisk GUI Framework\\nThe Asterisk GUI Framework, new in Asterisk 1.4, is a framework system that\\nallows web developers to create graphical interfaces with minimal interference to\\nthe standard configuration files.\\n\\nxvi | Preface\\n\\x0cChapter 12, Relational Database Integration\\nWalks you through setting up Asterisk to work with ODBC databases.\\nChapter 13, Managing Your Asterisk System\\nDiscusses issues regarding how to best manage your Asterisk phone system, including CDR, logs, and prompts.\\nChapter 14, Potpourri\\nBriefly covers what is, in fact, a rich and varied cornucopia of incredible features\\nand functions--all part of the Asterisk phenomenon.\\nChapter 15, Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\nPredicts a future where open source telephony completely transforms an industry\\ndesperately in need of a revolution.\\nAppendix A, VoIP Channels\\nAppendix B, Application Reference\\nAppendix C, AGI Reference\\nAppendix D, Configuration Files\\nAppendix E, Asterisk Dialplan Functions\\nAppendix F, Asterisk Manager Interface Actions\\nAppendix G, An Example of func_odbc\\n\\nSoftware\\nThis book is focused on documenting Asterisk Version 1.4; however, many of the conventions and information in this book are version-agnostic. Linux is the operating\\nsystem we have run and tested Asterisk on, with a leaning toward Red Hat syntax. We\\ndecided that while Red Hatbased distributions may not be the preferred choice of\\neveryone, their layout and utilities are nevertheless familiar to many experienced Linux\\nadministrators.\\n\\nConventions Used in This Book\\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this book:\\nItalic\\nIndicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, file extensions, pathnames,\\ndirectories, and Unix utilities.\\nConstant width\\n\\nIndicates commands, options, parameters, and arguments that must be substituted\\ninto commands.\\n\\nPreface | xvii\\n\\x0cConstant width bold\\n\\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user. Also used\\nfor emphasis in code.\\nConstant width italic\\n\\nShows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values.\\n[ Keywords and other stuff ]\\n\\nIndicates optional keywords and arguments.\\n{ choice-1 | choice-2 }\\n\\nSignifies either choice-1 or choice-2.\\nThis icon signifies a tip, suggestion, or general note.\\n\\nThis icon indicates a warning or caution.\\n\\nUsing Code Examples\\nThis book is here to help you get your job done.

With no challenges to properly exercise the skills I had developed, I spent my time trying to figure\\nout what the rest of my career was going to look like. The telecommunications industry\\nhad fallen from the pedestal of being a darling of investors to being a joke known to\\neven the most uninformed. I was supposed to feel fortunate to be one of the few who\\nstill had work, but what thankless, purposeless work it was. We knew why our industry\\nhad collapsed: the products we sold could not hope to deliver the solutions our customers required--even though the industry promised that they could. They lacked\\nflexibility, and were priced totally out of step with the functionality they were delivering\\n(or, more to the point, were failing to deliver). Nowhere in the industry were there any\\nsigns this was going to change any time soon.\\nI had been dreaming of an open source PBX for many long years, but I really didn\\'t\\nknow how such a thing could ever come to be--I\\'d given up on the idea several years\\nbefore. I knew that to be successful, an open source PBX would need to effectively\\nbridge the worlds of legacy and network-based telecom. I always failed to find anything\\nthat seemed ready.\\nThen, one fine day in spring, I half-heartedly seeded a Google search with the phrase\\n\"open source telephony,\" and discovered a bright new future for telecom: Asterisk, the\\nopen source Linux PBX.\\nThere it was: the very thing I\\'d been dreaming of for so many years. I had no idea how\\nI was going to contribute, but I knew this: open source telephony was going to cause\\na necessary and beneficial revolution in the telecom industry, and one way or another,\\nI was going to be a part of it.\\nFor me, more of a systems integrator than developer, I needed a way to contribute to\\nthe community. There didn\\'t seem to be a shortage of developers, but there sure was\\na shortage of documentation. This sounded like something I could do. I knew how to\\nwrite, I knew PBXes, and I desperately needed to talk about this phenomenon that\\nsuddenly made telecom fun again.\\nIf I contribute only one thing to this book, I hope you will catch some of my enthusiasm\\nfor the subject of open source telephony. This is an incredible gift we have been given,\\nbut also an incredible responsibility. What a wonderful challenge. What a cosmic opportunity. What delicious fun!\\n\\n To get a sense of how big the Asterisk phenomenon is, type \"PBX\" into Google. As you look at the results,\\n\\nbear in mind that the traditional PBX industry represents billions of dollars. The big players are companies\\nsuch as Avaya, Nortel, Siemens, Mitel, Cisco, NEC, and many, many more. It is somewhat telling that they\\ndon\\'t seem to be concerned about how they rank in a Google search. As a cultural barometer, we\\'re pretty\\nsure this matters.\\n\\nPreface | xxi\\n\\x0cFirst of all, I need to thank Leif and Jared for inviting me to join the Asterisk Documentation Project. I have immensely enjoyed working with both of you, and I am\\nconstantly amazed at how well our personalities and skills complement each other. A\\ntruly balanced team, are we. Also, thanks goes to Figment for all the typing.\\nTo my wife Killi, and my children Kaara, Joonas, and Joosep (who always remember\\nto visit me when I disappear into my underground lair for too long): you are a source\\nof inspiration to me. Your love is the fuel that feeds my fire, and I thank you.\\nObviously, I need to thank my parents, Jack and Martiny, for always believing in me,\\nno matter how many rules I broke. In a few years, I\\'ll have my own teenagers, and it\\'ll\\nbe your turn to laugh!\\nTo Mark Spencer: thanks for all of the things that everybody else thanks you for, but\\nalso, personally, thanks for giving generously of your time to the Asterisk community.\\nThe Toronto Asterisk Users\\' Group (http://www.taug.ca) made a quantum leap forward\\nas a result of your taking the time to speak to us, and that event will forever form a part\\nof our history. Oh yeah, and thanks for the beers, too. :-)\\nFinally, thanks to the Asterisk Community. This book is our gift to you. We hope you\\nenjoy reading it as much as we\\'ve enjoyed writing it.\\n\\nLeif Madsen\\nThe road to this book is a long one--nearly three years in the making. Back when I\\nstarted using Asterisk, possibly much like you, I didn\\'t know anything about Asterisk,\\nvery little about traditional telephony, and even less about Voice over IP. I delved right\\ninto this new and very exciting world and took in all I could. For two months during a\\nco-op term, for which I couldn\\'t immediately find work, I absorbed as much as I could,\\nasking questions, trying things and seeing what the system could do. Unfortunately\\nvery little to no documentation existed for Asterisk, aside from some dialplan examples\\nI was able to find by John Todd, and having questions answered by Brian K. West on\\nIRC. Of course, this method wasn\\'t going to scale.\\nNot being much of a coder, I wanted to contribute something back to the community,\\nand what do coders hate doing more than anything? Documentation! So I started The\\nAsterisk Documentation Assignment (TADA), a basic outline with some information\\nfor the beginnings of a book.\\nShortly after releasing it on my web site, an intelligent fellow by the name of Jared Smith\\nintroduced himself. He had similar aspirations for creating a \"dead-tree\" format book\\nfor the community, and we humbly started the Asterisk Documentation Project. Jared\\nset up a simple web site at http://www.asteriskdocs.org, a CVS server, and the very first\\nDocBook-formatted version of a book for Asterisk. From there we started filling in\\ninformation, and soon had information submitted by a number of members of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nxxii | Preface\\n\\x0cIn June of 2004, an animated chap by the name of Jim Van Meggelen started showing\\nup on the mailing lists, and contributing lots of information and documentation--this\\nwas definitely a guy we wanted on our team! Jim had the vision and the drive to really\\nget Jared\\'s and my butts in gear and to work on something grander. Jim brought us\\nyears of experience and a writing flair that we could have hardly imagined.\\nWith the core documentation team established, we embarked on a plan for the creation\\nof volumes of Asterisk knowledge, eventually to lead to a complete library and a wealth\\nof information. This book is essentially the beginning of that dream.\\nFirstly and mostly, I have to thank my parents, Rick and Carol, for always supporting\\nmy efforts, allowing me to realize my dreams, and always putting my needs ahead of\\ntheirs. Without their vision, understanding, and insight into the future, it would have\\nbeen impossible to have accomplished what I have. I love you both very much!\\nI\\'d like to thank Felix Carapaica and Bill Farkas of the Sheridan Institute of Technology\\nfor their dedication to the advancement of knowledge. Their teaching has complemented my prior learning, and has allowed me to expand my understanding of routing and\\ntelecommunications exponentially.\\nThere are far too many people to thank individually, but of particular importance, the\\nfollowing people were, and are, the most influential to my understanding of Asterisk:\\nJoshua Colp, Tilghman Lesher, Russell Bryant, Steve Murphy, Olle Johansson, Steven\\nSokol, Brian K. West, John Todd, and William Suffill, for my very first VoIP phone\\n(which I use to this day!). And for those who I said I\\'d mention in the book...thanks!\\nAnd of course, I must thank Jared Smith and Jim Van Meggelen for having the vision\\nand understanding of how important documentation really is--all of this would have\\nbeen impossible without you.\\n\\nJared Smith\\nI first started working with Asterisk in the spring of 2002. I had recently started a new\\njob with a market research company, and ended up taking a long road trip to a remote\\ncall center with the CIO. On the long drive home we talked about innovation in telephony, and he mentioned a little open source telephony project he had heard of called\\nAsterisk. Over the next few months, I was able to talk the company into buying a\\ndeveloper\\'s kit from Digium and started playing with Asterisk on company time.\\nDuring the next few months, I became more and more involved with the Asterisk community. I read the mailing lists. I scoured the archives. I hung out in the IRC channel,\\njust hoping to find nuggets of Asterisk knowledge. As time went on, I was finally able\\nto figure out enough to get Asterisk up and running.\\nThat\\'s when the real fun began.\\nWith the help of the CIO and the approval of the CEO, we moved forward with plans\\nto move our entire telecom infrastructure to Asterisk, including our corporate office\\n\\nPreface | xxiii\\n\\x0cand all of our remote call centers. Along the way, we ran into a lot of uncharted territory,\\nand I began thinking about creating a good repository of Asterisk knowledge. Over the\\ncourse of the project, we were able to do some really innovative things, such as invent\\nIAX trunking!\\nWhen all was said and done, we ended up with around forty Asterisk servers spread\\nacross many different geographical locations, all communicating with each other to\\nprovide a cohesive enterprise-class VoIP phone system. This system currently handles\\napproximately 1 million minutes of calls per month, serves several hundred employees,\\nconnects to 27 voice T1s, and saves the company around $20,000 (USD) per month\\non their telecom costs. In short, our Asterisk project was a resounding success!\\nWhile in the middle of implementing this project, I met Leif in one of the Asterisk IRC\\nchannels. We talked about ways we could help out new Asterisk users and lower the\\nbarrier to entry, and we decided to push ahead with plans to more fully document\\nAsterisk. I really wanted some good documentation in \"dead-tree\" format --basically\\na book that a new user could pick up and learn the basics of Asterisk. About that same\\ntime, the number of new users on the Asterisk mailing lists and in the IRC channels\\ngrew tremendously, and we felt that writing an Asterisk book would greatly improve\\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. The Asterisk Documentation Project was born! The rest, they\\nsay, is history.\\nSince then, we\\'ve been writing Asterisk documentation. I never thought it would be\\nthis arduous, yet rewarding. (I joked with Leif and Jim that it might be easier and less\\ncontroversial to write an in-depth tome called Religion, Gun Control, and Sushi than\\ncover everything that Asterisk has to offer in sufficient detail!) What you see here is a\\ndirect result of a lot of late nights and long weekends spent helping the Asterisk community--after all, it\\'s the least we could do, considering what Asterisk has given to us.\\nWe hope it will inspire other members of the Asterisk community to help document\\nchanges and new features for the benefit of all involved.\\nNow to thank some people:\\nFirst of all, I\\'d like to thank my beautiful wife. She\\'s put up with a lot of lonely nights\\nwhile I\\'ve been slaving away at the keyboard, and I\\'d like her to know how much I\\nappreciate her and her endless support. I\\'d also like to thank my kids for doing their\\nbest to remind me of the important things in life. I love you!\\nTo my parents: thanks for everything you\\'ve done to help me stretch and grow and\\nlearn over the years. You\\'re the best parents a person could ask for.\\nTo Dave Carr and Michael Lundberg: thanks for letting me learn Asterisk on company\\ntime. Working with both of you was truly a pleasure. May God smile upon you and\\ngrant you success and joy in all you do.\\nTo Leif and Jim: thanks for putting up with my stupid jokes, my insistence that we do\\nthings \"the right way,\" and my crazy schedule. Thanks for pushing me along, and\\n\\nxxiv | Preface\\n\\x0cmaking me a better writer. I\\'ve really enjoyed working with you two, and hope to\\ncollaborate with you on future projects!\\nTo Mark Spencer: thank you for your continued support and dedication and friendship.\\nYou\\'ve been an invaluable resource to our effort, and I truly believe that you\\'ve started\\na revolution in the world of telephony. You\\'re always welcome in my home and at my\\ndinner table!\\nTo the other great people at Digium: thank you for your help and support. We\\'re\\nespecially thankful for your willingness to give us more insight into the Asterisk code,\\nand for donating hardware so that we can better document the Asterisk Developer\\'s Kit.\\nTo Steven Sokol, Steven Critchfield, Olle E. Johansson, and all the others who have\\ncontributed to the Asterisk Documentation Project and to this book: thank you! We\\ncouldn\\'t have done it without your help and suggestions.\\n\\nPreface | xxv\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nA Telephony Revolution\\n\\nIt does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an\\nirate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires\\nin people\\'s minds.\\n--Samuel Adams\\n\\nAn incredible revolution is under way. It has been a long time in coming, but now that\\nit has started, there will be no stopping it. It is taking place in an area of technology\\nthat has lapsed embarrassingly far behind every other industry that calls itself hightech. The industry is telecommunications, and the revolution is being fueled by an open\\nsource Private Branch eXchange (PBX) called AsteriskTM.\\nTelecommunications is arguably the last major electronics industry that has remained\\nuntouched by the open source revolution.* Major telecommunications manufacturers\\nstill build ridiculously expensive, incompatible systems, running complicated, ancient\\ncode on impressively engineered yet obsolete hardware.\\nAs an example, Nortel\\'s Business Communications Manager kludges together a 15\\nyear-old Key Telephone Switch and a 1.2 GHz Celeron PC. All this can be yours for\\nbetween $5,000 and $15,000, not including telephones. If you want it to actually do\\nanything interesting, you\\'ll have to pay extra licensing fees for closed, limitedfunctionality, shrink-wrapped applications. Customization? Forget it--it\\'s not in the\\nplan. Future technology and standards compliance? Give them a year or two--they\\'re\\nworking on it.\\nAll of the major telecommunications manufacturers offer similar-minded products.\\nThey don\\'t want you to have flexibility or choice; they want you to be locked in to their\\nproduct cycles.\\n* Until now.\\n To its credit, Nortel finally got rid of Windows NT 4.0 and installed Linux. Technically a good idea, but\\n\\nrather odd, given that Nortel and Microsoft recently announced a partnership to develop enterprise telecom\\napplications together.\\n\\n\\x0cAsterisk changes all of that. With Asterisk, no one is telling you how your phone system\\nshould work, or what technology you are limited to. If you want it, you can have it.\\nAsterisk lovingly embraces the concept of standards compliance, while also enjoying\\nthe freedom to develop its own innovations. What you choose to implement is up to\\nyou--Asterisk imposes no limits.\\nNaturally, this incredible flexibility comes with a price: Asterisk is not a simple system\\nto configure. This is not because it\\'s illogical, confusing, or cryptic; to the contrary, it\\nis very sensible and practical. People\\'s eyes light up when they first see an Asterisk\\ndialplan and begin to contemplate the possibilities. But when there are literally thousands of ways to achieve a result, the process naturally requires extra effort. Perhaps it\\ncan be compared to building a house: the components are relatively easy to understand,\\nbut a person contemplating such a task must either a) enlist competent help or b)\\ndevelop the required skills through instruction, practice, and a good book on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nVoIP: Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Network\\nTelephony\\nWhile Voice over IP (VoIP) is often thought of as little more than a method of obtaining\\nfree long-distance calling, the real value (and--let\\'s be honest--challenge as well) of\\nVoIP is that it allows voice to become nothing more than another application in the\\ndata network.\\nIt sometimes seems that we\\'ve forgotten that the purpose of the telephone is to allow\\npeople to communicate. It is a simple goal, really, and it should be possible for us to\\nmake it happen in far more flexible and creative ways than are currently available to\\nus. Since the industry has demonstrated an unwillingness to pursue this goal, a large\\ncommunity of passionate people have taken on the task.\\nThe challenge comes from the fact that an industry that has changed very little in the\\nlast century shows little interest in starting now.\\n\\nThe Zapata Telephony Project\\nThe Zapata Telephony Project was conceived of by Jim Dixon, a telecommunications\\nconsulting engineer who was inspired by the incredible advances in CPU speeds that\\nthe computer industry has now come to take for granted. Dixon\\'s belief was that far\\nmore economical telephony systems could be created if a card existed that had nothing\\nmore on it than the basic electronic components required to interface with a telephone\\ncircuit. Rather than having expensive components on the card, Digital Signal Processing\\n(DSP) would be handled in the CPU by software. While this would impose a tremendous load on the CPU, Dixon was certain that the low cost of CPUs relative to their\\nperformance made them far more attractive than expensive DSPs, and, more impor-\\n\\n2 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0ctantly, that this price/performance ratio would continue to improve as CPUs continued\\nto increase in power.\\nLike so many visionaries, Dixon believed that many others would see this opportunity,\\nand that he merely had to wait for someone else to create what to him was an obvious\\nimprovement. After a few years, he noticed that not only had no one created these cards,\\nbut it seemed unlikely that anyone was ever going to. At that point it was clear that if\\nhe wanted a revolution, he was going to have to start it himself. And so the Zapata\\nTelephony Project was born:\\nSince this concept was so revolutionary, and was certain to make a lot of waves in the\\nindustry, I decided on the Mexican revolutionary motif, and named the technology and\\norganization after the famous Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. I decided to call\\nthe card the \"tormenta\" which, in Spanish, means \"storm,\" but contextually is usually\\nused to imply a big storm, like a hurricane or such.\\n\\nPerhaps we should be calling ourselves Asteristas. Regardless, we owe Jim Dixon a debt\\nof thanks, partly for thinking this up and partly for seeing it through, but mostly for\\ngiving the results of his efforts to the open source community. As a result of Jim\\'s\\ncontribution, Asterisk\\'s Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) engine came to\\nbe.\\n\\nMassive Change Requires Flexible Technology\\nThe most successful key telephone system in the world has a design limitation that has\\nsurvived 15 years of users begging for what appears to be a simple change: when you\\ndetermine the number of times your phone will ring before it forwards to voicemail,\\nyou can choose from 2, 3, 4, 6, or 10 ring cycles. Have you any idea how many times\\npeople ask for five rings? Plead as the customers might, the manufacturers of this system\\ncannot get their head around the idea that this is a problem. That\\'s the way it works,\\nthey say, and users need to get over it.\\nAnother example from the same system is that the name you program on your set can\\nonly be seven characters in length. Back in the late 1980s, when this particular system\\nwas designed, RAM was very expensive, and storing those seven characters for dozens\\nof sets represented a huge hardware expense. So what\\'s the excuse today? None. Are\\nthere any plans to change it? Hardly--the issue is not even officially acknowledged as\\na problem.\\n\\n The term DSP also means Digital Signal Processor, which is a device (usually a chip) that is capable of\\n\\ninterpreting and modifying signals of various sorts. In a voice network, DSPs are primarily responsible for\\nencoding, decoding, and transcoding audio information. This can require a lot of computational effort.\\n Jim Dixon, \"The History of Zapata Telephony and How It Relates to the Asterisk PBX\" (http://www.asteriskdocs.org/\\n\\nmodules/tinycontent/index.php?id=10).\\n If your name is Elizabeth, for example, you will have to figure something else out like elizbth, or elizabe, or\\n\\nperhaps lizabth. OK, so liz might serve as well, but you get the point.\\n\\nMassive Change Requires Flexible Technology | 3\\n\\x0cThose are just two examples; the industry is rife with them.\\nNow, it\\'s all very well and good to pick on one system, but the reality is that every PBX\\nin existence suffers shortcomings. No matter how fully featured it is, something will\\nalways be left out, because even the most feature-rich PBX will always fail to anticipate\\nthe creativity of the customer. A small group of users will desire an odd little feature\\nthat the design team either did not think of or could not justify the cost of building,\\nand, since the system is closed, the users will not be able to build it themselves.\\nIf the Internet had been thusly hampered by regulation and commercial interests, it is\\ndoubtful that it would have developed the wide acceptance it currently enjoys. The\\nopenness of the Internet meant that anyone could afford to get involved. So, everyone\\ndid. The tens of thousands of minds that collaborated on the creation of the Internet\\ndelivered something that no corporation ever could have.\\nAs with many other open source projects, such as Linux and the Internet, the development of Asterisk was fueled by the dreams of folks who knew that there had to be\\nsomething more than what the industry was producing. The strength of the community\\nis that it is composed not of employees assigned to specific tasks, but rather of folks\\nfrom all sorts of industries, with all sorts of experiences, and all sorts of ideas about\\nwhat flexibility means, and what openness means. These people knew that if one could\\ntake the best parts of various PBXes and separate them into interconnecting components--akin to a boxful of LEGO bricks--one could begin to conceive of things that\\nwould not survive a traditional corporate risk-analysis process. While no one can seriously claim to have a complete picture of what this thing should look like, there is no\\nshortage of opinions and ideas.#\\nMany people new to Asterisk see it as unfinished. Perhaps these people can be likened\\nto visitors to an art studio, looking to obtain a signed, numbered print. They often leave\\ndisappointed, because they discover that Asterisk is the blank canvas, the tubes of paint,\\nthe unused brushes waiting.*\\nEven at this early stage in its success, Asterisk is nurtured by a greater number of artists\\nthan any other PBX. Most manufacturers dedicate no more than a few developers to\\nany one product; Asterisk has scores. Most proprietary PBXes have a worldwide support team comprised of a few dozen real experts; Asterisk has hundreds.\\nThe depth and breadth of the expertise that surrounds this product is unmatched in\\nthe telecom industry. Asterisk enjoys the loving attention of old Telco guys who\\n# From the release of Asterisk 1.2 to Asterisk 1.4, there have been over 4,000 updates to the code in the SVN\\n\\nrepository.\\n* It should be noted that these folks need not leave disappointed. Several projects have arisen to lower the\\n\\nbarriers to entry for Asterisk. By far the most popular and well known is trixbox (http://www.trixbox.org). If\\nyou have an old PC lying around (or a copy of VMware), trixbox will build a GUI-based PBX for you simply\\nby answering a few questions during the automated install process. This does not make it easier to learn\\nAsterisk, because you are no longer involved in the platform or dialplan configuration, but it will deliver a\\nworking PBX to you much faster than the more hands-on approach we employ in this book.\\n\\n4 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0cremember when rotary dial mattered, enterprise telecom people who recall when voicemail was the hottest new technology, and data communications geeks and coders\\nwho helped build the Internet. These people all share a common belief--that the telecommunications industry needs a proper revolution.\\nAsterisk is the catalyst.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Hacker\\'s PBX\\nTelecommunications companies who choose to ignore Asterisk do so at their peril. The\\nflexibility it delivers creates possibilities that the best proprietary systems can scarcely\\ndream of. This is because Asterisk is the ultimate hacker\\'s PBX.\\nIf someone asks you not to use the term hacker, refuse. This term does not belong to\\nthe mass media. They stole it and corrupted it to mean \"malicious cracker.\" It\\'s time\\nwe took it back. Hackers built the networking engine that is the Internet. Hackers built\\nthe Apple Macintosh and the Unix operating system. Hackers are also building your\\nnext telecom system. Do not fear; these are the good guys, and they\\'ll be able to build\\na system that\\'s far more secure than anything that exists today. Rather than being\\nconstricted by the dubious and easily cracked security of closed systems, the hackers\\nwill be able to quickly respond to changing trends in security and fine-tune the telephone system in response to both corporate policy and industry best practices.\\nLike other open source systems, Asterisk will be able to evolve into a far more secure\\nplatform than any proprietary system, not in spite of its hacker roots, but rather because\\nof them.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Professional\\'s PBX\\nNever in the history of telecommunications has a system so suited to the needs of\\nbusiness been available, at any price. Asterisk is an enabling technology and, as with\\nLinux, it will become increasingly rare to find an enterprise that is not running some\\nversion of Asterisk, in some capacity, somewhere in the network, solving a problem as\\nonly Asterisk can.\\nThis acceptance is likely to happen much faster than it did with Linux, though, for\\nseveral reasons:\\n Linux has already blazed the trail that led to open source acceptance. Asterisk is\\nfollowing that lead.\\n The telecom industry is crippled, with no leadership being provided by the giant\\nindustry players. Asterisk has a compelling, realistic, and exciting vision.\\n\\n The telecom industry has been predicting a revolution since before the crash; time will tell how well they\\n\\nrespond to the open source revolution.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Hacker\\'s PBX | 5\\n\\x0c End users are fed up with incompatible, limited functionality, and horrible support.\\nAsterisk solves the first two problems; entepreneurs and the community are addressing the latter.\\n\\nThe Asterisk Community\\nOne of the compelling strengths of Asterisk is the passionate community that developed\\nand supports it. This community, led by Mark Spencer of Digium, is keenly aware of\\nthe cultural significance of Asterisk, and is giddy about the future.\\nOne of the more powerful side effects caused by the energy of the Asterisk community\\nis the cooperation it has spawned among the telecommunications professionals, networking professionals, and information technology professionals who share a love for\\nthis phenomenon. While these professions have traditionally been at odds with each\\nother, in the Asterisk community they delight in each others\\' skills. The significance of\\nthis cooperation cannot be underestimated.\\nStill, if the dream of Asterisk is to be realized, the community must grow--yet one of\\nthe key challenges that the community currently faces is a rapid influx of new users.\\nThe members of the existing community, having birthed this thing called Asterisk, are\\ngenerally welcoming of new users, but they\\'ve grown impatient with being asked the\\nkinds of questions whose answers can often be obtained independently, if one is willing\\nto put forth the time needed to research and experiment.\\nObviously, new users do not fit any particular kind of mold. While some will happily\\nspend hours experimenting and reading various blogs describing the trials and tribulations of others, many people who have become enthusiastic about this technology\\nare completely uninterested in such pursuits. They want a simple, straightforward, stepby-step guide that\\'ll get them up and running, followed by some sensible examples\\ndescribing the best methods of implementing common functionality (such as voicemail,\\nauto attendants, and the like).\\nTo the members of the expert community, who (correctly) perceive that Asterisk is like\\na web development language, this approach doesn\\'t make any sense. To them, it\\'s clear\\nthat you have to immerse yourself in Asterisk to appreciate its subtleties. Would one\\nask for a step-by-step guide to programming and expect to learn from it all that a language has to offer?\\nClearly, there\\'s no one approach that\\'s right for everyone. Asterisk is a different animal\\naltogether, and it requires a totally different mind-set. As you explore the community,\\nthough, be aware that there are people with many different skill sets and attitudes here.\\nSome of these folks do not display much patience with new users, but that\\'s often due\\nto their passion for the subject, not because they don\\'t welcome your participation.\\n\\n6 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0cThe Asterisk Mailing Lists\\nAs with any community, there are places where members of the Asterisk community\\nmeet to discuss matters of mutual interest. Of the mailing lists you will find at http://\\nlists.digium.com, these four are currently the most important:\\nAsterisk-Biz\\nAnything commercial with respect to Asterisk belongs in this list. If you\\'re selling\\nsomething Asterisk-related, sell it here. If you want to buy an Asterisk service or\\nproduct, post here.\\nAsterisk-Dev\\nThe Asterisk developers hang out here. The purpose of this list is the discussion of\\nthe development of the software that is Asterisk, and its participants vigorously\\ndefend that purpose. Expect a lot of heat if you post anything to this list not relating\\nto programming or development of the Asterisk code base specifically. General\\ncoding questions (such as interfacing with AGI or AMI), should be directed to the\\nAsterisk-Users list.\\nThe Asterisk-Dev list is not second-level support! If you scroll\\nthrough the mailing list archives, you\\'ll see this is a strict rule. The\\nAsterisk-Dev mailing list is about discussion of core Asterisk development, and questions about interfacing your external programs via AGI or AMI should be posted on the Asterisk-Users list.\\n\\nAsterisk-Users\\nThis is where most Asterisk users hang out. This list generates several hundred\\nmessages per day and has over ten thousand subscribers. While you can go here\\nfor help, you are expected to have done some reading on your own before you post\\na query.\\nAsterisk-BSD\\nThis is where users who are implementing Asterisk on FreeBSD (and other BSD\\ndialects) hang out.\\n\\nThe Asterisk Wiki\\nThe Asterisk Wiki (which exists in large part due to the tireless efforts of James Thompson--thanks James!) is a source of much enlightenment and confusion. A communitymaintained repository of VoIP knowledge (http://www.voip-info.org) contains a truly\\ninspiring cornucopia of fascinating, informative, and frequently contradictory information about many subjects, just one of which is Asterisk.\\nSince Asterisk documentation forms by far the bulk of the information on this web\\nsite, and it probably contains more Asterisk knowledge than all other sources put\\ntogether (with the exception of the mailing-list archives), it is commonly referred to as\\nthe place to go for Asterisk knowledge.\\nThe Asterisk Community | 7\\n\\x0cThe IRC Channels\\nThe Asterisk community maintains Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels on\\nirc.freenode.net. The two most active channels are #asterisk and #asterisk-dev. To cut\\ndown on spam-bot intrusions, both of these channels now require registration to join.\\n\\nAsterisk User Groups\\nIn many cites around the world, lonely Asterisk users began to realize that there were\\nother like-minded people in their towns. Asterisk User Groups (AUGs) began to spring\\nup all over the place. While these groups don\\'t have any official affiliation with each\\nother, they generally link to each others\\' web sites and welcome members from anywhere. Type \"Asterisk User Group\" into Google to track down one in your area.\\n\\nThe Asterisk Documentation Project\\nThe Asterisk Documentation Project was started by Leif Madsen and Jared Smith, but\\nseveral people in the community have contributed.\\nThe goal of the documentation project is to provide a structured repository of written\\nwork on Asterisk. In contrast with the flexible and ad hoc nature of the Wiki, the Docs\\nproject is passionate about building a more focused approach to various\\nAsterisk-related subjects.\\nAs part of the efforts of the Asterisk Docs project to make documentation available\\nonline, this book is available at the http://www.asteriskdocs.org web site, under a Creative Commons license.\\n\\nThe Business Case\\nIt is very rare to find businesses these days that do not have to reinvent themselves every\\nfew years. It is equally rare to find a business that can afford to replace its communications infrastructure each time it goes in a new direction. Today\\'s businesses need\\nextreme flexibility in all of their technology, including telecom.\\nIn his book Crossing the Chasm (HarperBusiness), Geoffrey Moore opines, \"The idea\\nthat the value of the system will be discovered rather than known at the time of installation implies, in turn, that product flexibility and adaptability, as well as ongoing\\naccount service, should be critical components of any buyer\\'s evaluation checklist.\"\\n More than 30 percent, at last count.\\n The #asterisk-dev channel is for the discussion of changes to the underlying code base of Asterisk and is also\\n\\nnot second-tier support. Discussions related to programming external applications that interface with\\nAsterisk via AGI or AMI are meant to be in #asterisk.\\n /msg nickserv help when you connect to the service via your favorite IRC client.\\n\\n8 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0cWhat this means, in part, is that the true value of a technology is often not known until\\nit has been deployed.\\nHow compelling, then, to have a system that holds at its very heart the concept of\\nopenness and the value of continuous innovation.\\n\\nThis Book\\nSo where to begin? Well, when it comes to Asterisk, there is far more to talk about than\\nwe can fit into one book. For now, we\\'re not going to take you down all the roads that\\nthe ber-geeks follow--we\\'re just going to give you the basics.\\nIn Chapter 2, we cover some of the engineering considerations you should keep in mind\\nwhen designing a telecommunications system. You can skip much of this material if\\nyou want to get right to installing, but these are important concepts to understand,\\nshould you ever plan on putting an Asterisk system into production.\\nChapter 3 covers obtaining, compiling, and installing Asterisk, and Chapter 4 deals\\nwith the initial configuration of Asterisk. Here we cover the important configuration\\nfiles that must exist to define the channels and features available to your system. This\\nwill prepare you for Chapter 5, where we introduce the heart of Asterisk--the dialplan.\\nChapter 6 will introduce some more advanced dialplan concepts.\\nWe will take a break from Asterisk in Chapter 7 and discuss some of the more important\\ntechnologies in use in the PSTN. Naturally, following the discussion of legacy\\ntelephony, Chapter 8 discusses Voice over IP.\\nChapter 9 introduces one of the more amazing components, the Asterisk Gateway\\nInterface (AGI). Using Perl, PHP, and Python, we demonstrate how external programs\\ncan be used to add nearly limitless functionality to your PBX. In Chapter 14, we briefly\\ncover what is, in fact, a rich and varied cornucopia of incredible features and functions,\\nall of which are part of the Asterisk phenomenon. To conclude, Chapter 15 looks forward, predicting a future where open source telephony completely transforms an\\nindustry desperately in need of a revolution. You\\'ll also find a wealth of reference information in the book\\'s five appendixes.\\nThis book can only lay down the basics, but from this foundation you will be able to\\ncome to an understanding of the concept of Asterisk--and from that, who knows what\\nyou will build?\\n\\nThis Book | 9\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nPreparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\nVery early on, I knew that someday in some \"perfect\"\\nfuture out there over the horizon, it would be commonplace for computers to handle all of the necessary processing functionality internally, making the necessary\\nexternal hardware to connect up to telecom interfaces\\nvery inexpensive and, in some cases, trivial.\\n--Jim Dixon, \"The History of Zapata Telephony and\\nHow It Relates to the Asterisk PBX\"\\n\\nBy this point, you must be anxious to get your Asterisk system up and running. If you\\nare building a hobby system, you can probably jump right to the next chapter and begin\\nthe installation. For a mission-critical deployment, however, some thought must be\\ngiven to the environment in which the Asterisk system will run. Make no mistake:\\nAsterisk, being a very flexible piece of software, will happily and successfully install on\\nnearly any Linux platform you can conceive of, and several non-Linux platforms as\\nwell.* However, to arm you with an understanding of the type of operating environment\\nAsterisk will really thrive in, this chapter will discuss issues you need to be aware of in\\norder to deliver a reliable, well-designed system.\\nIn terms of its resource requirements, Asterisk\\'s needs are similar to those of an embedded, real-time application. This is due in large part to its need to have priority access\\nto the processor and system buses. It is, therefore, imperative that any functions on the\\nsystem not directly related to the call-processing tasks of Asterisk be run at a low priority, if at all. On smaller systems and hobby systems, this might not be as much of an\\nissue. However, on high-capacity systems, performance shortcomings will manifest as\\naudio quality problems for users, often experienced as echo, static, and the like. The\\nsymptoms will resemble those experienced on a cell phone when going out of range,\\n* People have successfully compiled and run Asterisk on WRAP boards, Linksys WRT54G routers, Soekris\\n\\nsystems, Pentium 100s, PDAs, Apple Macs, Sun SPARCs, laptops, and more. Of course, whether you would\\nwant to put such a system into production is another matter entirely. (Actually, the AstLinux distribution,\\nby Kristian Kielhofner, runs very well indeed on the Soekris 4801 board. Once you\\'ve grasped the basics of\\nAsterisk, this is something worth looking into further. Check out http://www.astlinux.org.)\\n\\n\\x0calthough the underlying causes will be different. As loads increase, the system will have\\nincreasing difficulty maintaining connections. For a PBX, such a situation is nothing\\nshort of disastrous, so careful attention to performance requirements is a critical consideration during the platform selection process.\\nTable 2-1 lists some very basic guidelines that you\\'ll want to keep in mind when planning your system. The next section takes a close look at the various design and\\nimplementation issues that will affect its performance.\\nThe size of an Asterisk system is actually not dictated by the number of\\nusers or sets, but rather by the number of simultaneous calls it will be\\nexpected to support. These numbers are very conservative, so feel free\\nto experiment and see what works for you.\\nTable 2-1. System requirement guidelines\\nPurpose\\n\\nNumber of channels\\n\\nMinimum recommended\\n\\nHobby system\\n\\nNo more than 5\\n\\n\\nSOHO system (small office/home office--\\nless than three lines and five sets)\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall business system\\n\\nUp to 25\\n\\n\\nMedium to large system\\n\\nMore than 25\\n\\nDual CPUs, possibly also multiple servers in a distributed architecture\\n\\nWith large Asterisk installations, it is common to deploy functionality across several\\nservers. One or more central units will be dedicated to call processing; these will be\\ncomplemented by one or more ancillary servers handling peripherals (such as a database system, a voicemail system, a conferencing system, a management system, a web\\ninterface, a firewall, and so on). As is true in most Linux environments, Asterisk is well\\nsuited to growing with your needs: a small system that used to be able to handle all\\nyour call-processing and peripheral tasks can be distributed among several servers when\\nincreased demands exceed its abilities. Flexibility is a key reason why Asterisk is extremely cost-effective for rapidly growing businesses; there is no effective maximum or\\nminimum size to consider when budgeting the initial purchase. While some scalability\\nis possible with most telephone systems, we have yet to hear of one that can scale as\\nflexibly as Asterisk. Having said that, distributed Asterisk systems are not simple to\\ndesign--this is not a task for someone new to Asterisk.\\n\\n12 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cIf you are sure that you need to set up a distributed Asterisk system, you\\nwill want to study the DUNDi protocol, Asterisk Realtime Architecture\\n(ARA), func_odbc, and the various other database tools at your disposal. This will help you to abstract the data your system requires from the\\ndialplan logic your Asterisk systems will utilize, allowing a generic set\\nof dialplan logic that can be used across multiple boxes, thereby allowing you to scale more simply by adding additional boxes to the system.\\nHowever, this is far beyond the scope of this book and will be left as an\\nexercise for the reader. If you want a teaser of some tools you can use\\nfor scaling, see Chapter 12.\\n\\nA Set of Load Test Results\\nJoshua Colp was able to produce the results in Table 2-2 on an AMD Athlon64 X2 4200\\n+ with 1 GB RAM and 80 GB SATA hard drive, testing with the default scenario in\\nthe SIPp application: a simple call setup, Playback() an audio file, and Wait() a short\\ntime. Notice the massive savings in CPU utilization while reading data from the RAM\\ndisk versus the hard drive. This could be interpreted as the CPU waiting for data to\\nprocess before delivering it to the requesting channel. However, this is just a simple\\ntest and in no way reflects the amount of calls your system will be able to handle. You\\nare encouraged to load test your own system to determine the number of simultaneous\\ncalls that can be handled utilizing your dialplan and combination of applications.\\nTable 2-2.

When selecting\\nyour hardware, you must carefully consider the overall design of your system and what\\nfunctionality you need to support. This will help you determine your requirements for\\nthe CPU, motherboard, and power supply. If you are simply setting up your first\\nAsterisk system for the purpose of learning, you can safely ignore the information in\\nthis section. If, however, you are building a mission-critical system suitable for deployment, these are issues that require some thought.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 13\\n\\x0cPerformance Issues\\nAmong other considerations, when selecting the hardware for an Asterisk installation\\nyou must bear in mind this critical question: how powerful must the system be? This\\nis not an easy question to answer, because the manner in which the system is to be used\\nwill play a big role in the resources it will consume. There is no such thing as an Asterisk\\nperformance-engineering matrix, so you will need to understand how Asterisk uses the\\nsystem in order to make intelligent decisions about what kinds of resources will be\\nrequired. You will need to consider several factors, including:\\nThe maximum number of concurrent connections the system will be expected to support\\nEach connection will increase the workload on the system.\\nThe percentage of traffic that will require processor-intensive DSP of compressed codecs\\n(such as G.729 and GSM)\\nThe Digital Signal Processing (DSP) work that Asterisk performs in software can\\nhave a staggering impact on the number of concurrent calls it will support. A system\\nthat might happily handle 50 concurrent G.711 calls could be brought to its knees\\nby a request to conference together 10 G.729 compressed channels. We\\'ll talk more\\nabout G.729, GSM, G.711, and many other codecs in Chapter 8.\\nWhether conferencing will be provided, and what level of conferencing activity is expected\\nWill the system be used heavily? Conferencing requires the system to transcode\\nand mix each individual incoming audio stream into multiple outgoing streams.\\nMixing multiple audio streams in near-real-time can place a significant load on the\\nCPU.\\nEcho cancellation\\nEcho cancellation may be required on any call where a Public Switched Telephone\\nNetwork (PSTN) interface is involved. Since echo cancellation is a mathematical\\nfunction, the more of it the system has to perform, the higher the load on the CPU\\nwill be.  Do not fear. Echo cancellation is another topic for Chapter 8.\\nDialplan scripting logic\\nWhenever Asterisk has to pass call control to an external program, there is a performance penalty. As much logic as possible should be built into the dialplan. If\\nexternal scripts are used, they should be designed with performance and efficiency\\nas critical considerations.\\nAs for the exact performance impact of these factors, it\\'s difficult to know for sure. The\\neffect of each is known in general terms, but an accurate performance calculator has\\nnot yet been successfully defined. This is partly because the effect of each component\\nof the system is dependent on numerous variables, such as CPU power, motherboard\\nchipset and overall quality, total traffic load on the system, Linux kernel optimizations,\\nnetwork traffic, number and type of PSTN interfaces, and PSTN traffic--not to mention\\n\\n Roughly 30 MHz of CPU power per channel.\\n\\n14 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cany non-Asterisk services the system is performing concurrently. Let\\'s take a look at\\nthe effects of several key factors:\\nCodecs and transcoding\\nSimply put, a codec (short for coder/decoder, or compression/decompression) is a\\nset of mathematical rules that define how an analog waveform will be digitized.\\nThe differences between the various codecs are due in large part to the levels of\\ncompression and quality that they offer. Generally speaking, the more compression\\nthat\\'s required, the more work the DSP must do to code or decode the signal.\\nUncompressed codecs, therefore, put far less strain on the CPU (but require more\\nnetwork bandwidth). Codec selection must strike a balance between bandwidth\\nand processor usage.\\nCentral processing unit (and Floating Point Unit)\\nA CPU is comprised of several components, one of which is the floating point unit\\n(FPU). The speed of the CPU, coupled with the efficiency of its FPU, will play a\\nsignificant role in the number of concurrent connections a system can effectively\\nsupport. The next section (\"Choosing a Processor) offers some general guidelines\\nfor choosing a CPU that will meet the needs of your system.\\nOther processes running concurrently on the system\\nBeing Unix-like, Linux is designed to be able to multitask several different processes. A problem arises when one of those processes (such as Asterisk) demands\\na very high level of responsiveness from the system. By default, Linux will distribute\\nresources fairly among every application that requests them. If you install a system\\nwith many different server applications, those applications will each be allowed\\ntheir fair use of the CPU. Since Asterisk requires frequent high-priority access to\\nthe CPU, it does not get along well with other applications, and if Asterisk must\\ncoexist with other apps, the system may require special optimizations. This primarily involves the assignment of priorities to various applications in the system\\nand, during installation, careful attention to which applications are installed as\\nservices.\\nKernel optimizations\\nA kernel optimized for the performance of one specific application is something\\nthat very few Linux distributions offer by default and, thus, it requires some\\nthought. At the very minimum--whichever distribution you choose--a fresh copy\\nof the Linux kernel (available from http://www.kernel.org) should be downloaded\\nand compiled on your platform. You may also be able to acquire patches that will\\nyield performance improvements, but these are considered hacks to the officially\\nsupported kernel.\\nIRQ latency\\nInterrupt request (IRQ) latency is basically the delay between the moment a peripheral card (such as a telephone interface card) requests the CPU to stop what\\nit\\'s doing and the moment when the CPU actually responds and is ready to handle\\nthe task. Asterisk\\'s peripherals (especially the Zaptel cards) are extremely intolerServer Hardware Selection | 15\\n\\x0cant of IRQ latency. This is not due to any problem with the cards so much as part\\nof the nature of how a software-based TDM engine has to work. If we buffer the\\nTDM data and send it on the bus as a larger packet, that may be more efficient\\nfrom a system perspective, but it will create a delay between the time the audio is\\nreceived on the card, and when it is delivered to the CPU. This makes real-time\\nprocessing of TDM data next to impossible. In the design of Zaptel, it was decided\\nthat sending the data every 1 ms would create the best trade-off, but a side effect\\nof this is that any card in the system that uses the Zaptel interface is going to ask\\nthe system to process an interrupt every millisecond. This used to be a factor on\\nolder motherboards, but it has largely ceased to be a cause for concern.\\nLinux has historically had problems with its ability to service IRQs\\nquickly; this problem has caused enough trouble for audio developers that several patches have been created to address this shortcoming. So far, there has been some mild controversy over how to\\nincorporate these patches into the Linux kernel.\\n\\nKernel version\\nAsterisk is officially supported on Linux Version 2.6.\\nLinux distribution\\nLinux distributions are many and varied. In the next chapter, we will discuss the\\nchallenge of selecting a Linux distribution, and how to obtain and install both\\nLinux and Asterisk.\\n\\nChoosing a Processor\\nSince the performance demands of Asterisk will generally involve a large number of\\nmath calculations, it is essential that you select a processor with a powerful FPU. The\\nsignal processing that Asterisk performs can quickly demand a staggering quantity of\\ncomplex mathematical computations from the CPU. The efficiency with which these\\ntasks are carried out will be determined by the power of the FPU within the processor.\\nTo actually name a best processor for Asterisk in this book would fly in the face of\\nMoore\\'s law. Even in the time between the authoring and publishing of this book,\\nprocessor speeds will undergo rapid improvements, as will Asterisk\\'s support for various architectures. Obviously, this is a good thing, but it also makes the giving of advice\\non the topic a thankless task. Naturally, the more powerful the FPU is, the more\\nconcurrent DSP tasks Asterisk will be able to handle, so that is the ultimate consideration. When you are selecting a processor, the raw clock speed is only part of the\\nequation. How well it handles floating-point operations will be a key differentiator, as\\nDSP operations in Asterisk will place a large demand on that process.\\nBoth Intel and AMD CPUs have powerful FPUs. Current-generation chips from either\\nof those manufacturers can be expected to perform well.\\n16 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cThe obvious conclusion is that you should get the most powerful CPU your budget will\\nallow. However, don\\'t be too quick to buy the most expensive CPU out there. You\\'ll\\nneed to keep the requirements of your system in mind; after all, a Formula 1 Ferrari is\\nill-suited to the rigors of rush-hour traffic. Slower CPUs will often run cooler and, thus,\\nyou might be able to build a lower-powered, fanless Asterisk system for a small office,\\nwhich could work well in a dusty environment, perhaps.\\nIn order to attempt to provide a frame of reference from which we can contemplate our\\nplatform decision, we have chosen to define three sizes of Asterisk systems: small,\\nmedium, and large.\\n\\nSmall systems\\nSmall systems (up to 10 phones) are not immune to the performance requirements of\\nAsterisk, but the typical load that will be placed on a smaller system will generally fall\\nwithin the capabilities of a modern processor.\\nIf you are building a small system from older components you have lying around, be\\naware that the resulting system cannot be expected to perform at the same level as a\\nmore powerful machine, and will run into performance degradation under a much\\nlighter load. Hobby systems can be run successfully on very low-powered hardware,\\nalthough this is by no means recommended for anyone who is not a whiz at Linux\\nperformance tuning.\\nIf you are setting up an Asterisk system for the purposes of learning, you will be able\\nto build a fully featured platform using a relatively low-powered CPU. The authors of\\nthis book run several Asterisk lab systems with 433 MHz to 700 MHz Celeron processors, but the workload of these systems is minimal (never more than two concurrent\\ncalls).\\n\\nAstLinux and Asterisk on OpenWRT\\nIf you are really comfortable working with Linux on embedded platforms, you will want\\nto join the AstLinux mailing list and run Kristian Kielhofner\\'s creation, AstLinux, or\\nget yourself a Linksys WRT54GL and install Brian Capouch\\'s version of Asterisk for\\nthat platform.\\nThese projects strip Asterisk down to its essentials, and allow incredibly powerful PBX\\napplications to be deployed on very inexpensive hardware.\\n If you want to be completely up to the minute on which CPUs are leading the performance race, surf on over\\n\\nto Tom\\'s Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com) or AnandTech (http://www.anandtech.com), where you\\nwill find a wealth of information about both current and out-of-date CPUs, motherboards, and chipsets.\\n Greg Boehnlein once compiled and ran Asterisk on a 133 MHz Pentium system, but that was mostly as an\\n\\nexperiment. Performance problems are far more likely, and properly configuring such a system requires an\\nexpert knowledge of Linux. We do not recommend running Asterisk on anything less than a 500 MHz system\\n(for a production system, 2 GHz might be a sensible minimum). Still, we think the fact that Asterisk is so\\nflexible is remarkable.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 17\\n\\x0cWhile both projects require a fair amount of knowlege and effort on your part, they\\nalso share a huge coolness factor, are extrememly popular, and are of excellent quality.\\n\\nMedium systems\\nMedium-sized systems (from 10 to 50 phones) are where performance considerations\\nwill be the most challenging to resolve. Generally, these systems will be deployed on\\none or two servers only and, thus, each machine will be required to handle more than\\none specific task. As loads increase, the limits of the platform will become increasingly\\nstressed. Users may begin to perceive quality problems without realizing that the system\\nis not faulty in any way, but simply exceeding its capacity. These problems will get\\nprogressively worse as more and more load is placed on the system, with the user experience degrading accordingly. It is critical that performance problems be identified\\nand addressed before they are noticed by users.\\nMonitoring performance on these systems and quickly acting on any developing trends\\nis key to ensuring that a quality telephony platform is provided.\\n\\nLarge systems\\nLarge systems (more than 120 channels) can be distributed across multiple systems and\\nsites and, thus, performance concerns can be managed through the addition of machines. Very large Asterisk systems have been created in this way.\\nBuilding a large system requires an advanced level of knowledge in many different\\ndisciplines. We will not discuss it in detail in this book, other than to say that the issues\\nyou\\'ll encounter will be similar to those encountered during any deployment of multiple servers handling a single, distributed task.\\n\\nChoosing a Motherboard\\nJust to get any anticipation out of the way, we also cannot recommend specific motherboards in this book. With new motherboards coming out on a weekly basis, any\\nrecommendations we could make would be rendered moot by obsolescence before the\\npublished copy hit the shelves. Not only that, but motherboards are like automobiles:\\nwhile they are all very similar in principle, the difference is in the details. And as Asterisk\\nis a performance application, the details matter.\\nWhat we will do, therefore, is give you some idea of the kinds of motherboards that\\ncan be expected to work well with Asterisk, and the features that will make for a good\\nmotherboard. The key is to have both stability and high performance. Here are some\\nguidelines to follow:\\n The various system buses must provide the minimum possible latency. If you are\\nplanning a PSTN connection using analog or PRI interfaces (discussed later in this\\nchapter), having Zaptel cards in the system will generate 1,000 interrupt requests\\n18 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cper second. Having devices on the bus that interfere with this process will result\\nin degradation of call quality. Chipsets from Intel (for Intel CPUs) and nVidia\\nnForce (for AMD CPUs) seem to score the best marks in this area. Review the\\nspecific chipset of any motherboard you are evaluating to ensure that it does not\\nhave known problems with IRQ latency.\\n If you are running Zaptel cards in your system, you will want to ensure that your\\nBIOS allows you maximum control over IRQ assignment. As a rule, high-end\\nmotherboards will offer far greater flexibility with respect to BIOS tweaking; valuepriced boards will generally offer very little control. This may be a moot point,\\nhowever, as APIC-enabled motherboards turn IRQ control over to the operating\\nsystem.\\n Server-class motherboards generally implement a different PCI standard than\\nworkstation-class motherboards. While there are many differences, the most obvious and well known is that the two versions have different voltages. Depending\\non which cards you purchase, you will need to know if you require 3.3V or 5V PCI\\nslots. Figure 2-1 shows the visual differences between 3.3V and 5V slots. Most\\nserver motherboards will have both types, but workstations will typically have only\\nthe 5V version.\\nThere is some evidence that suggests connecting together two completely separate, single-CPU systems may provide far more benefits\\nthan simply using two processors in the same machine. You not\\nonly double your CPU power, but you also achieve a much better\\nlevel of redundancy at a similar cost to a single-chassis, dual-CPU\\nmachine. Keep in mind, though, that a dual-server Asterisk solution will be more complex to design than a single-machine solution.\\n\\n Consider using multiple processors, or processors with multiple cores. This will\\nprovide an improvement in the system\\'s ability to handle multiple tasks. For Asterisk, this will be of special benefit in the area of floating-point operations.\\n If you need a modem, install an external unit that connects to a serial port. If you\\nmust have an internal modem, you will need to ensure that it is not a so-called\\n\"Win-modem\"--it must be a completely self-sufficient unit (note that these are\\nvery difficult, if not impossible, to find).\\n Consider that with built-in networking, if you have a network component failure,\\nthe entire motherboard will need to be replaced. On the other hand, if you install\\na peripheral Network Interface Card (NIC), there may be an increased chance of\\n With the advent of PCI-X and PCI-Express, it is becoming harder and harder to select a motherboard with\\n\\nthe correct type of slots. Be very certain that the motherboard you select has the correct type and quantity of\\ncard slots for your hardware. Keep in mind that most companies that produce hardware cards for Asterisk\\noffer PCI and PCI-Express versions, but it\\'s still up to you to make sure they make sense in whatever\\nmotherboard and chassis combination you choose.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 19\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-1. Visual identification of PCI slots\\n\\nfailure due to the extra mechanical connections involved. It can also be useful to\\nhave separate network cards serving sets and users (the internal network) and VoIP\\nproviders and external sites (the external network). NICs are cheap; we suggest\\nalways having at least two.\\n The stability and quality of your Asterisk system will be dependent on the components you select for its architecture. Asterisk is a beast, and it expects to be fed\\nthe best. As with just about anything, high cost is not always synonymous with\\nquality, but you will want to become a connoisseur of computer components.\\nHaving said all that, we need to get back to the original point: Asterisk can and will\\nhappily install on pretty much any system that will run Linux. The lab systems used to\\nwrite this book, for example, included everything from a Linksys WRT to a dual-Xeon\\nlocomotive.# We have not experienced any performance or stability problems running\\nless than five concurrent telephone connections. For the purposes of learning, do not\\nbe afraid to install Asterisk on whatever system you can scrounge up. When you are\\nready to put your system into production, however, you will need to understand the\\nramifications of the choices you make with respect to your hardware.\\n\\nPower Supply Requirements\\nOne often-overlooked component in a PC is the power supply (and the supply of power). For a telecommunications system,* these components can play a significant role in\\nthe quality of the user experience.\\n# OK, it wasn\\'t actually a locomotive, but it sure sounded like one. Does anyone know where to get quiet CPU\\n\\nfans for Xeon processors? It\\'s getting too loud in the lab here.\\n* Or any system that is expected to process audio.\\n\\n20 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cComputer power supplies\\nThe power supply you select for your system will play a vital role in the stability of the\\nentire platform. Asterisk is not a particularly power-hungry application, but anything\\nrelating to multimedia (whether it be telephony, professional audio, video, or the like)\\nis generally sensitive to power quality.\\nThis oft-neglected component can turn an otherwise top-quality system into a poor\\nperformer. By the same token, a top-notch power supply might enable an otherwise\\ncheap PC to perform like a champ.\\nThe power supplied to a system must provide not only the energy the system needs to\\nperform its tasks but also stable, clean signal lines for all of the voltages your system\\nexpects from it.\\nSpend the money and get a top-notch power supply (gamers are pretty passionate about\\nthis sort of thing, so there are lots of choices out there).\\n\\nRedundant power supplies\\nIn a carrier-grade or high-availability environment, it is common to deploy servers that\\nuse a redundant power supply. Essentially, this involves two completely independent\\npower supplies, either one of which is capable of meeting the power requirements of\\nthe system.\\nIf this is important to you, keep in mind that best practices suggest that to be properly\\nredundant, these power supplies should be connected to completely independent uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes) that are in turn fed by totally separate electrical\\ncircuits. In truly mission-critical environments (such as hospitals), even the main electrical feeds into the building are redundant, and diesel-powered generators are on-site\\nto generate electricity during extended power failures (such as the one that hit Northeastern North America on August 15, 2003).\\n\\nEnvironment\\nYour system\\'s environment consists of all of those factors that are not actually part of\\nthe server itself but nevertheless play a crucial role in the reliability and quality that can\\nbe expected from the system. Electrical supplies, room temperature and humidity,\\nsources of interference, and security are all factors that should be contemplated.\\n\\nPower Conditioning and Uninterruptible Power Supplies\\nWhen selecting the power sources for your system, consideration should be given not\\nonly to the amount of power the system will use, but also to the manner in which this\\npower is delivered.\\n\\nEnvironment | 21\\n\\x0cPower is not as simple as voltage coming from the outlet in the wall, and you should\\nnever just plug a production system into whatever electrical source is near at\\nhand.Giving some consideration to the supply of power to your system can provide a\\nfar more stable power environment, leading to a far more stable system.\\nOne of the benefits of clean power is a reduction in heat, which means less stress on\\ncomponents, leading to a longer life expectancy.\\nProperly grounded, conditioned power feeding a premium-quality power supply will\\nensure a clean logic ground (a.k.a. 0 volt) reference for the system and keep electrical\\nnoise on the motherboard to a minimum. These are industry-standard best practices\\nfor this type of equipment, which should not be neglected. A relatively simple way to\\nachieve this is through the use of a power-conditioned UPS.\\n\\nPower-conditioned UPSes\\nThe UPS is well known for its role as a battery backup, but the power-conditioning\\nbenefits that high-end UPS units also provide are less well understood.\\nPower conditioning can provide a valuable level of protection from the electrical environment by regenerating clean power through an isolation transformer. A quality\\npower conditioner in your UPS will eliminate most electrical noise from the power feed\\nand help to ensure a rock-steady supply of power to your system.\\nUnfortunately, not all UPS units are created equal; many of the less expensive units do\\nnot provide clean power. What\\'s worse, manufacturers of these devices will often\\npromise all kinds of protection from surges, spikes, overvoltages, and transients. While\\nsuch devices may protect your system from getting fried in an electrical storm, they will\\nnot clean up the power being fed to your system and, thus, will do nothing to contribute\\nto stability.\\nMake sure your UPS is power conditioned. If it doesn\\'t say exactly that, it isn\\'t.\\n\\nGrounding\\nVoltage is defined as the difference in electrical potential between two points. When\\nconsidering a ground (which is basically nothing more than an electrical path to earth),\\nthe common assumption is that it represents 0 volts. But if we do not define that 0V in\\n\\n Okay, look, you can plug it in wherever you\\'d like, and it\\'ll probably work, but if your system has strange\\n\\nstability problems, please give this section another read. Deal?\\n In electronic devices, a binary zero (0) is generally related to a 0 volt signal, while a binary one (1) can be\\n\\nrepresented by many different voltages (commonly between 2.5 and 5 volts). The grounding reference that\\nthe system will consider 0 volts is often referred to as the logic ground. A poorly grounded system might have\\nelectrical potential on the logic ground to such a degree that the electronics mistake a binary zero for a binary\\none. This can wreak havoc with the system\\'s ability to process instructions.\\n It is a common misconception belief that all UPSes provide clean power. This is not at all true.\\n\\n22 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0crelation to something, we are in danger of assuming things that may not be so. If you\\nmeasure the voltage between two grounding references, you\\'ll often find that there is\\na voltage potential between them. This voltage potential between grounding points can\\nbe significant enough to cause logic errors--or even damage--in a system where more\\nthan one path to ground is present.\\nOne of the authors recalls once frying a sound card he was trying to\\nconnect to a friend\\'s stereo system. Even though both the computer and\\nthe stereo were in the same room, more than 6 volts of difference was\\nmeasured between the ground conductors of the two electrical outlets\\nthey were plugged into! The wire between the stereo and the PC (by way\\nof the sound card) provided a path that the voltage eagerly followed,\\nthus frying a sound card that was not designed to handle that much\\ncurrent on its signal leads. Connecting both the PC and the stereo to the\\nsame outlet fixed the problem.\\n\\nWhen considering electrical regulations, the purpose of a ground is primarily human\\nsafety. In a computer, the ground is used as a 0V logic reference. An electrical system\\nthat provides proper safety will not always provide a proper logic reference--in fact,\\nthe goals of safety and power quality are sometimes in disagreement. Naturally, when\\na choice must be made, safety has to take precedence.\\nSince the difference between a binary zero and a binary one is represented in computers by voltage differences of sometimes less than 3V, it is\\nentirely possible for unstable power conditions caused by poor grounding or electrical noise to cause all kinds of intermittent system problems.\\nSome power and grounding advocates estimate that more than 80 percent of unexplained computer glitches can be traced to power quality.\\nMost of us blame Microsoft.\\n\\nModern switching power supplies are somewhat isolated from power quality issues,\\nbut any high-performance system will always benefit from a well-designed power environment. In mainframes, proprietary PBXes, and other expensive computing\\nplatforms, the grounding of the system is never left to chance. The electronics and\\nframes of these systems are always provided with a dedicated ground that does not\\ndepend on the safety grounds supplied with the electrical feed.\\nRegardless of how much you are willing to invest in grounding, when you specify the\\nelectrical supply to any PBX, ensure that the electrical circuit is completely dedicated\\nto your system (as discussed in the next section) and that an insulated, isolated grounding conductor is provided. This can be expensive to provision, but it will contribute\\ngreatly to a quality power environment for your system.\\nIt is also vital that each and every peripheral you connect to your system be connected\\nto the same electrical receptacle (or, more specifically, the same ground reference). This\\nEnvironment | 23\\n\\x0cwill cut down on the occurrence of ground loops, which can cause anything from\\nbuzzing and humming noises to damaged or destroyed equipment.\\n\\nElectrical Circuits\\nIf you\\'ve ever seen the lights dim when an electrical appliance kicks in, you\\'ve seen the\\neffect that a high-energy device can have on an electrical circuit. If you were to look at\\nthe effects of a multitude of such devices, each drawing power in its own way, you\\nwould see that the harmonically perfect 50 or 60 Hz sine wave you may think you\\'re\\ngetting with your power is anything but. Harmonic noise is extremely common on\\nelectrical circuits , and it can wreak havoc on sensitive electronic equipment. For a PBX,\\nthese problems can manifest as audio problems, logic errors, and system instability.\\nIdeally, you should never install a server on an electrical circuit that is shared with other\\ndevices. There should be only one outlet on the circuit, and you should connect only\\nyour telephone system (and associated peripherals) to it. The wire (including the\\nground) should be run unbroken directly back to the electrical panel. The grounding\\nconductor should be insulated and isolated. There are far too many stories of photocopiers, air conditioners, and vacuum cleaners wreaking havoc with sensitive electronics to ignore this rule of thumb.\\nThe electrical regulations in your area must always take precedence over\\nany ideas presented here. If in doubt, consult a power quality expert in\\nyour area on how to ensure that you adhere to electrical regulations.\\nRemember, electrical regulations take into account the fact that human\\nsafety is far more important than the safety of the equipment.\\n\\nThe Equipment Room\\nEnvironmental conditions can wreak havoc on systems, and yet it is quite common to\\nsee critical systems deployed with little or no attention given to these matters. When\\nthe system is installed, everything works well, but after as little as six months, components begin to fail. Talk to anyone with experience in maintaining servers and systems,\\nand it becomes obvious that attention to environmental factors can play a significant\\nrole in the stability and reliability of systems.\\n\\nHumidity\\nSimply put, humidity is water in the air. Water is a disaster for electronics for two main\\nreasons: 1) water is a catalyst for corrosion, and 2) water is conductive enough that it\\n\\n On a hobby system, this is probably too much to ask, but if you are planning on using Asterisk for anything\\n\\nimportant, at least be sure to give it a fighting chance; don\\'t put anything like air conditioners, photocopiers,\\nlaser printers, or motors on the same circuit. The strain such items place on your power supply will shorten\\nits life expectancy.\\n\\n24 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0ccan cause short circuits. Do not install any electronic equipment in areas of high humidity without providing a means to remove the moisture.\\n\\nTemperature\\nHeat is the enemy of electronics. The cooler you keep your system, the more reliably\\nit will perform, and the longer it will last. If you cannot provide a properly cooled room\\nfor your system, at a minimum ensure that it is placed in a location that ensures a steady\\nsupply of clean, cool air. Also, keep the temperature steady. Changes in temperature\\ncan lead to condensation and other damaging changes.\\n\\nDust\\nAn old adage in the computer industry holds that dust bunnies inside of a computer\\nare lucky. Let\\'s consider some of the realities of dust bunnies:\\n Significant buildup of dust can restrict airflow inside the system, leading to increased levels of heat.\\n Dust can contain metal particles, which, in sufficient quantities, can contribute to\\nsignal degradation or shorts on circuit boards.\\nPut critical servers in a filtered environment, and clean out dust bunnies on a regular\\nschedule.\\n\\nSecurity\\nServer security naturally involves protecting against network-originated intrusions, but\\nthe environment also plays a part in the security of a system. Telephone equipment\\nshould always be locked away, and only persons who have a need to access the equipment should be allowed near it.\\n\\nTelephony Hardware\\nIf you are going to connect Asterisk to any traditional telecommunications equipment,\\nyou will need the correct hardware. The hardware you require will be determined by\\nwhat it is you want to achieve.\\n\\nConnecting to the PSTN\\nAsterisk allows you to seamlessly bridge circuit-switched telecommunications networks# with packet-switched data networks.* Because of Asterisk\\'s open architecture\\n(and open source code), it is ultimately possible to connect any standards-compliant\\n\\n# Often referred to as TDM networks, due to the Time Division Multiplexing used to carry traffic through the\\n\\nPSTN.\\n\\nTelephony Hardware | 25\\n\\x0cinterface hardware. The selection of open source telephony interface boards is currently\\nlimited, but as interest in Asterisk grows, that will rapidly change. At the moment, one\\nof the most popular and cost-effective ways to connect to the PSTN is to use the interface cards that evolved from the work of the Zapata Telephony Project (http://www.za\\npatatelephony.org).\\n\\nAnalog interface cards\\nUnless you need a lot of channels (or a have lot of money to spend each month on\\ntelecommunications facilities), chances are that your PSTN interface will consist of one\\nor more analog circuits, each of which will require a Foreign eXchange Office (FXO)\\nport.\\nDigium, the company that sponsors Asterisk development, produces analog interface\\ncards for Asterisk. Check out its web site for its extensive line of analog cards, including\\nthe venerable TDM400P, the latest TDM800P, and the high-density TDM2400P. As\\nan example, the TDM800P is an eight-port base card that allows for the insertion of up\\nto two daughter cards, which each deliver either four FXO or four FXS ports. The\\nTDM800P can be purchased with these modules preinstalled, and a hardware echocanceller can be added as well. Check out Digium\\'s web site (http://www.digium.com)\\nfor more information about these cards.\\nOther companies that produce Asterisk-compatible analog cards include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRhino (http://www.channelbanks.com)\\nSangoma (http://www.sangoma.com)\\nVoicetronix (http://www.voicetronix.com)\\nPika Technologies (http://www.pikatechnologies.com)\\n\\nThese are all well-established companies that produce excellent products.\\n\\nDigital interface cards\\nIf you require more than 10 circuits, or require digital connectivity, chances are you\\'re\\ngoing to be in the market for a T1 or E1 card. Bear in mind, though, that the monthly\\ncharges for a digital PSTN circuit vary widely. In some places, as few as five circuits can\\njustify a digital circuit; in others, the technology may never be cost-justifiable. The more\\n* Popularly called VoIP networks, although Voice over IP is not the only method of transmitting voice over\\n\\npacket networks (Voice over Frame Relay was very popular in the late 1990s).\\n The evolution of inexpensive, commodity-based telephony hardware is only slightly behind the telephony\\n\\nsoftware revolution. New companies spring up on a weekly basis, each one bringing new and inexpensive\\nstandards-based devices into the market.\\n FXS and FXO refer to the opposing ends of an analog circuit. Which one you need will be determined by\\n\\nwhat you want to connect to. Chapter 7 discusses these in more detail.\\n T1 and E1 are digital telephony circuits. We\\'ll discuss them further in Chapter 7.\\n\\n26 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cDigital\\n\\n\\nFXO\\nFXS\\nChannel bank FXS\\n\\nAnalog\\n\\nCentral office\\n\\nPBX\\n\\nFigure 2-2. One way you might connect a channel bank\\n\\ncompetition there is in your area, the better chance you have of finding a good deal. Be\\nsure to shop around.\\nThe Zapata Telephony Project originally produced a T1 card, the Tormenta, that is the\\nancestor of most Asterisk-compatible T1 cards. The original Tormenta cards are now\\nconsidered obsolete, but they do still work with Asterisk.\\nDigium makes several different digital circuit interface cards. The features on the cards\\nare the same; the primary differences are whether they provide T1 or E1 interfaces, and\\nhow many spans each card provides. Digium has been producing Zaptel cards for Linux\\nlonger than anyone else, as they were deeply involved with the development of Zaptel\\non Linux, and have been the driving force behind Zaptel development over the years.\\nSangoma, which has been producing open source WAN cards for many years, added\\nAsterisk support for its T1/E1 cards a few years ago. Rhino has had T1 hardware for\\nAsterisk for a while now, and there are many other companies that offer digital interface\\ncards for Asterisk as well.\\n\\nChannel banks\\nA channel bank is loosely defined as a device that allows a digital circuit to be demultiplexed into several analog circuits (and vice versa). More specifically, a channel\\nbank lets you connect analog telephones and lines into a system across a T1 line.\\nFigure 2-2 shows how a channel bank fits into a typical office phone system.\\nAlthough they can be expensive to purchase, many people feel very strongly that the\\nonly proper way to integrate analog circuits and devices into Asterisk is through a\\nchannel bank. Whether that is true or not depends on a lot of factors, but if you have\\nthe budget, they can be very useful.# You can often pick up used channel banks on\\neBay. Look for units from Adtran and Carrier Access Corp. (Rhino makes great channel\\n It should be noted that a Sangoma Frame Relay card played a role in the original development of Asterisk\\n\\n(see http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8678310302.html); Sangoma has a long history of supporting open\\nsource WAN interfaces with Linux.\\n\\nTelephony Hardware | 27\\n\\x0cbanks, and they are very competitively priced, but they may be hard to find used on\\neBay.) Don\\'t forget that you will need a T1 card in order to connect a channel bank to\\nAsterisk.\\n\\nOther types of PSTN interfaces\\nMany VoIP gateways exist that can be configured to provide access to PSTN circuits.\\nGenerally speaking, these will be of most use in a smaller system (one or two lines).\\nThey can also be very complicated to configure, as grasping the interaction between\\nthe various networks and devices requires a solid understanding of both telephony and\\nVoIP fundamentals. For that reason, we will not discuss these devices in detail in this\\nbook. They are worth looking into, however; popular units are made by Sipura, Grandstream, Digium, and many other companies.\\nAnother way to connect to the PSTN is through the use of Basic Rate Interface (BRI)\\nISDN circuits. BRI is a digital telecom standard that specifies a two-channel circuit that\\ncan carry up to 144 Kbps of traffic. It is very rarely used in North America, but in Europe\\nit is very widely deployed. Due to the variety of different ways this technology has been\\nimplemented, and a lack of testing equipment, we will not be discussing BRI in very\\nmuch detail in this book. Please note, however, that BRI is very popular in Europe, and\\nDigium has produced the B410P card to address this need.\\n\\nConnecting Exclusively to a Packet-Based Telephone Network\\nIf you do not need to connect to the PSTN, Asterisk requires no hardware other than\\na server with a Network Interface Card (NIC).\\nHowever, if you are going to be providing music on hold* or conferencing and you have\\nno physical timing source, you will need the ztdummy Linux kernel module.\\nztdummy is a clocking mechanism designed to provide a timing source to a system\\nwhere no hardware timing source exists. Think of it as a kind of metronome to allow\\nthe system to mix multiple audio streams in a properly synchronized manner.\\n\\nEcho Cancellation\\nOne of the issues that can arise if you use analog interfaces on a VoIP system is echo.\\nEcho is simply what you say being reflected back to you a short time later. The echo is\\ncaused by the far end, but you are the one that hears it. It is a little known fact that echo\\nwould be a massive problem in the PSTN were it not for the fact that the carriers employ\\ncomplex (and expensive) strategies to eliminate it. We will talk about echo a bit more\\nlater on, but with respect to hardware we would suggest that you consider adding echo# We use channel banks to simulate a central office. One 24-port channel bank off an Asterisk system can\\n\\nprovide up to 24 analog lines--perfect for a classroom or lab.\\n* Technically, no timing source is needed for music on hold, but it generally works better with one.\\n\\n28 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0ccancellation hardware to any card you purchase for use as a PSTN interface. While\\nAsterisk can do some work with echo in software, it does not provide nearly enough\\npower to deal with the problem. Also, echo cancellation in software imposes a load on\\nthe processor; hardware echo cancellers built into the PSTN card take this burden away\\nfrom the CPU.\\nHardware echo cancellation can add several hundred dollars to your equipment cost,\\nbut if you are serious about having a quality system, invest the extra money now instead\\nof suffering later. Echo problems are not pleasant at all, and your users will hate the\\nsystem if they experience it.\\nAs of this writing, several software echo cancellers have become available. We have not\\nhad a chance to evaluate any of them, but we know that they employ the same algorythems the hardware echo cancellers do. If you have a recently purchased Digium analog\\ncard, you can call Digium sales for a keycode to allow its latest software echo canceller\\nto work with your system. There are other software options available for other types\\nof cards, but you will have to look into whether you have to purchase a license to use\\nthem. Keep in mind that there is a performance cost to using software echo cancellers.\\nThey will place a measureable load on the CPU that needs to be taken into account\\nwhen you design a system using these technologies.\\n\\nTypes of Phones\\nSince the title of this book is Asterisk: The Future of Telephony, we would be remiss if\\nwe didn\\'t discuss the devices that all of this technology ultimately has to interconnect:\\ntelephones!\\nWe all know what a telephone is--but will it be the same five years from now? Part of\\nthe revolution that Asterisk is contributing to is the evolution of the telephone, from a\\nsimple audio communications device into a multimedia communications terminal providing all kinds of yet-to-be-imagined functions.\\nAs an introduction to this exciting concept, we will briefly discuss the various kinds of\\ndevices we currently call \"telephones\" (any of which can easily be integrated with Asterisk). We will also discuss some ideas about what these devices may evolve into in\\nthe future (devices that will also easily integrate with Asterisk).\\n\\n This software is not part of a normal Asterisk download because Digium has to pay to license it separately.\\n\\nNevertheless, it has grandfathered it into all of its cards, so it is available for free to anyone who has a Digium\\nanalog card that is still under warranty. If you are running a non-Digium analog card, you can purchase a\\nkeycode for this software echo canceller from Digium\\'s web site.\\n Sangoma also offers free software echo cancellation on their analog cards (up to six channels).\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 29\\n\\x0cPhysical Telephones\\nAny physical device whose primary purpose is terminating an on-demand audio communications circuit between two points can be classified as a physical telephone. At a\\nminimum, such a device has a handset and a dial pad; it may also have feature keys, a\\ndisplay screen, and various audio interfaces.\\nThis section takes a brief look at the various user (or endpoint) devices you might want\\nto connect to your Asterisk system. We\\'ll delve more deeply into the mechanics of\\nanalog and digital telephony in Chapter 7.\\n\\nAnalog telephones\\nAnalog phones have been around since the invention of the telephone. Up until about\\n20 years ago, all telephones were analog. Although analog phones have some technical\\ndifferences in different countries, they all operate on similar principles.\\nThis contiguous connection is referred to as a circuit, which the\\ntelephone network used to use electromechanical switches to create--\\nhence the term circuit-switched network.\\n\\nWhen a human being speaks, the vocal cords, tongue, teeth, and lips create a complex\\nvariety of sounds. The purpose of the telephone is to capture these sounds and convert\\nthem into a format suitable for transmission over wires. In an analog telephone, the\\ntransmitted signal is analogous to the sound waves produced by the person speaking.\\nIf you could see the sound waves passing from the mouth to the microphone, they\\nwould be proportional to the electrical signal you could measure on the wire.\\nAnalog telephones are the only kind of phone that are commonly available in any retail\\nelectronics store. In the next few years, that can be expected to change dramatically.\\n\\nProprietary digital telephones\\nAs digital switching systems developed in the 1980s and 1990s, telecommunications\\ncompanies developed digital Private Branch eXchanges (PBXes) and Key Telephone\\nSystems (KTSes). The proprietary telephones developed for these systems were completely dependent on the systems to which they were connected and could not be used\\non any other systems. Even phones produced by the same manufacturer were not crosscompatible (for example, a Nortel Norstar set will not work on a Nortel Meridian 1\\nPBX). The proprietary nature of digital telephones limits their future. In this emerging\\nera of standards-based communications, they will quickly be relegated to the dustbin\\nof history.\\nThe handset in a digital telephone is generally identical in function to the handset in\\nan analog telephone, and they are often compatible with each other. Where the digital\\n\\n30 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cphone is different is that inside the telephone, the analog signal is sampled and converted into a digital signal--that is, a numerical representation of the analog waveform.\\nWe\\'ll leave a detailed discussion of digital signals until Chapter 7; for now, suffice it to\\nsay that the primary advantage of a digital signal is that it can be transmitted over\\nlimitless distances with no loss of signal quality.\\nThe chances of anyone ever making a proprietary digital phone directly compatible\\nwith Asterisk are slim, but companies such as Citel (http://www.citel.com) have created\\ngateways that convert the proprietary signals to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\\n\\nISDN telephones\\nPrior to VoIP, the closest thing to a standards-based digital telephone was an ISDNBRI terminal. Developed in the early 1980s, ISDN was expected to revolutionize the\\ntelecommunications industry in exactly the same way that VoIP promises to finally\\nachieve today.\\nThere are two types of ISDN: Primary Rate Interface (PRI) and\\nBasic Rate Interface (BRI). PRI is commonly used to provide trunking\\nfacilities between PBXes and the PSTN, and is widely deployed all over\\nthe world. BRI is not at all popular in North America, but is common\\nin Europe.\\n\\nWhile ISDN was widely deployed by the telephone companies, many consider the\\nstandard to have been a flop, as it generally failed to live up to its promises. The high\\ncosts of implementation, recurring charges, and lack of cooperation among the major\\nindustry players contributed to an environment that caused more problems than it\\nsolved.\\nBRI was intended to service terminal devices and smaller sites (a BRI loop provides two\\ndigital circuits). A wealth of BRI devices have been developed, but BRI has largely been\\ndeprecated in favor of faster, less expensive technologies such as ADSL, cable modems,\\nand VoIP.\\nBRI is still very popular for use in video-conferencing equipment, as it provides a fixed\\nbandwidth link. Also, BRI does not have the type of quality of service issues a VoIP\\nconnection might, as it is circuit-switched.\\n\\n Citel has produced a fantastic product that is limited by the fact that it is too expensive. If you have old\\n\\nproprietary PBX telephones, and you want to use them with your Asterisk system, Citel\\'s technology can do\\nthe job, but make sure you understand how the per-port cost of these units stacks up against replacing the\\nold sets with pure VoIP telephones.\\n The SIP is currently the most well-known and popular protocol for VoIP. We will discuss it further in\\n\\nChapter 8.\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 31\\n\\x0cBRI is still sometimes used in place of analog circuits to provide trunking to a PBX.\\nWhether or not this is a good idea depends mostly on how your local phone company\\nprices the service, and what features it is willing to provide.#\\n\\nIP telephones\\nIP telephones are heralds of the most exciting change in the telecommunications industry. Already now, standards-based IP telephones are available in retail stores. The\\nwealth of possibilities inherent in these devices will cause an explosion of interesting\\napplications, from video phones to high-fidelity broadcasting devices, to wireless mobility solutions, to purpose-built sets for particular industries, to flexible all-in-one\\nmultimedia systems.\\nThe revolution that IP telephones will spawn has nothing to do with a new type of wire\\nto connect your phone to, and everything to do with giving you the power to communicate the way you want.\\nThe early-model IP phones that have been available for several years now do not represent the future of these exciting appliances. They are merely a stepping-stone, a\\nfamiliar package in which to wrap a fantastic new way of thinking.\\nThe future is far more promising.\\n\\nSoftphones\\nA softphone is a software program that provides telephone functionality on a non-telephone device, such as a PC or PDA. So how do we recognize such a beast? What might\\nat first glance seem a simple question actually raises many. A softphone should probably\\nhave some sort of dial pad, and it should provide an interface that reminds users of a\\ntelephone. But will this always be the case?\\nThe term softphone can be expected to evolve rapidly, as our concept of what exactly\\na telephone is undergoes a revolutionary metamorphosis.* As an example of this evolution, consider the following: would we correctly define popular communication\\nprograms such as Instant Messenger as softphones? IM provides the ability to initiate\\nand receive standards-based VoIP connections. Does this not qualify it as a softphone?\\nAnswering that question requires knowledge of the future that we do not yet possess.\\nSuffice it to say that while at this point in time, softphones are expected to look and\\nsound like traditional phones, that conception is likely to change in the very near future.\\nAs standards evolve and we move away from the traditional telephone and toward a\\nmultimedia communications culture, the line between softphones and physical telephones will become blurred indeed. For example, we might purchase a communica# If you are in North America, give up on this idea, unless you have a lot of patience and money, and are a bit\\n\\nof a masochist.\\n* Ever heard of Skype?\\n\\n32 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0ctions terminal to serve as a telephone and install a softphone program onto it to provide\\nthe functions we desire.\\nHaving thus muddied the waters, the best we can do at this point is to define what the\\nterm softphone will refer to in relation to this book, with the understanding that the\\nmeaning of the term can be expected to undergo a massive change over the next few\\nyears. For our purposes, we will define a softphone as any device that runs on a personal\\ncomputer, presents the look and feel of a telephone, and provides as its primary function\\nthe ability to make and receive full-duplex audio communications (formerly known as\\n\"phone calls\") through E.164 addressing.\\n\\nTelephony Adaptors\\nA telephony adaptor (usually referred to as an ATA, or Analog Terminal Adaptor) can\\nloosely be described as an end-user device that converts communications circuits from\\none protocol to another. Most commonly, these devices are used to convert from some\\ndigital (IP or proprietary) signal to an analog connection that you can plug a standard\\ntelephone or fax machine into.\\nThese adaptors could be described as gateways, for that is their function. However,\\npopular usage of the term telephony gateway would probably best describe a multiport\\ntelephony adaptor, generally with more complicated routing functions.\\nTelephony adaptors will be with us for as long as there is a need to connect incompatible\\nstandards and old devices to new networks. Eventually, our reliance on these devices\\nwill disappear, as did our reliance on the modem--obsolescence through irrelevance.\\n\\nCommunications Terminals\\nCommunications terminal is an old term that disappeared for a decade or two and is\\nbeing reintroduced here, very possibly for no other reason than that it needs to be\\ndiscussed so that it can eventually disappear again--once it becomes ubiquitous.\\nFirst, a little history. When digital PBX systems were first released, manufacturers of\\nthese machines realized that they could not refer to their endpoints as telephones--\\ntheir proprietary nature prevented them from connecting to the PSTN. They were\\ntherefore called terminals, or stations. Users, of course, weren\\'t having any of it. It\\nlooked like a telephone and acted like a telephone, and therefore it was a telephone.\\nYou will still occasionally find PBX sets referred to as terminals, but for the most part\\nthey are called telephones.\\n\\n OK, so you think you know what a phone call is? So did we. Let\\'s just wait a few years, shall we?\\n E.164 is the ITU standard that defines how phone numbers are assigned. If you\\'ve used a telephone, you\\'ve\\n\\nused E.164 addressing.\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 33\\n\\x0cThe renewed relevance of the term communications terminal has nothing to do with\\nanything proprietary--rather, it\\'s the opposite. As we develop more creative ways of\\ncommunicating with each other, we gain access to many different devices that will allow\\nus to connect. Consider the following scenarios:\\n If I use my PDA to connect to my voicemail and retrieve my voice messages (converted to text), does my PDA become a phone?\\n If I attach a video camera to my PC, connect to a company\\'s web site, and request\\na live chat with a customer service rep, is my PC now a telephone?\\n If I use the IP phone in my kitchen to surf for recipes, is that a phone call?\\nThe point is simply this: we\\'ll probably always be \"phoning\" each other, but will we\\nalways be using \"telephones\" to do so?\\n\\nLinux Considerations\\nIf you ask anyone at the Free Software Foundation, they will tell you that what we know\\nas Linux is in fact GNU/Linux. All etymological arguments aside, there is some valuable\\ntruth to this statement. While the kernel of the operating system is indeed Linux, the\\nvast majority of the utilities installed on a Linux system and used regularly are in fact\\nGNU utilities. \"Linux\" is probably only 5 percent Linux, possibly 75 percent GNU,\\nand perhaps 20 percent everything else.\\nWhy does this matter? Well, the flexibility of Linux is both a blessing and a curse. It is\\na blessing because with Linux you can truly craft your very own operating system from\\nscratch. Since very few people ever do this, the curse is in large part due to the responsibility you must bear in determining which of the GNU utilities to install, and how to\\nconfigure the system.\\nIf this seems overwhelming, do not fear. In the next chapter, we will discuss the selection, installation, and configuration of the software environment for your Asterisk\\nsystem.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ve discussed all manner of issues that can contribute to the stability\\nand quality of an Asterisk installation. Before we scare you off, we should tell you that\\nmany people have installed Asterisk on top of a graphical Linux workstation--running\\na web server, a database, and who knows what else--with no problems whatsoever.How much time and effort you should devote to following the best practices and\\n\\n Just don\\'t ever install the X-windowing environment (which is anything that delivers a desktop, such as\\n\\nGNOME, KDE, and such). You are almost guaranteed to have audio quality problems, as Asterisk and the\\nGUI will fight for control of the CPU.\\n\\n34 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cengineering tips in this chapter all depends on how much work you expect the Asterisk\\nserver to perform, and how much quality and reliability your system must provide. If\\nyou are experimenting with Asterisk, don\\'t worry too much; just be aware that any\\nproblems you have may not be the fault of the Asterisk system.\\nWhat we have attempted to do in this chapter is give you a feel for the kinds of best\\npractices that will help to ensure that your Asterisk system will be built on a reliable,\\nstable platform. Asterisk is quite willing to operate under far worse conditions, but the\\namount of effort and consideration you decide to give these matters will play a part in\\nthe stability of your PBX. Your decision should depend on how critical your Asterisk\\nsystem will be.\\n\\nConclusion | 35\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nInstalling Asterisk\\n\\nI long to accomplish great and noble tasks, but it is my\\nchief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they\\nwere great and noble. The world is moved along, not\\nonly by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the\\naggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.\\n--Helen Keller\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed preparing a system to install Asterisk. Now it\\'s\\ntime to get our hands dirty!\\nAlthough a large number of Linux* distributions and PC architectures are excellent\\ncandidates for Asterisk, we have chosen to focus on a single distribution in order to\\nmaintain brevity and clarity throughout the book. The instructions that follow have\\nbeen made as generic as possible, but you will notice a leaning toward CentOS directory\\nstructure and system utilities. We have chosen to focus on CentOS (arguably, the most\\npopular distro for Asterisk) because its command set, directory structure, and so forth\\nare likely to be familiar to a larger percentage of readers (we have found that many\\nLinux administrators are familiar with CentOS, even if they don\\'t prefer it). This doesn\\'t\\nmean that CentOS is the only choice, or even the best one for you. A question that often\\nappears on the mailing lists is: \"Which distribution of Linux is the best to use with\\nAsterisk?\" The multitude of answers generally boils down to \"the one you like the\\nbest.\"\\n\\n* And some non-Linux operating systems as well, such as Solaris, *BSD, and OS X. You should note that while\\n\\npeople have managed to successfully run Asterisk on these alternative systems, Asterisk was, and continues\\nto be, actively developed for Linux.\\n We will be using CentOS Server 4.4 in this book, which we usually install with nothing except the Editors\\n\\npackage selected. If you are not sure what distribution to choose, CentOS is an excellent choice. CentOS can\\nbe obtained from http://www.centos.org.\\n\\n\\x0cWhat Packages Do I Need?\\nMost Asterisk configurations are composed of three main packages : the main Asterisk\\nprogram (asterisk), the Zapata telephony drivers (zaptel), and the PRI libraries (libpri).\\nIf you plan on a pure VoIP network, the only real requirement is the asterisk package,\\nbut we recommend installing all three packages; you can choose what modules to activate later. The zaptel drivers are required if you are using analog or digital hardware,\\nor if you\\'re using the ztdummy driver (discussed later in this chapter) as a timing source.\\nThe libpri library is optional unless you\\'re using ISDN PRI interfaces, and you may save\\na small amount of RAM if you don\\'t load it, but we recommend that it be installed in\\nconjunction with the zaptel package for completeness.\\nIn the first edition of this book, we recommended that you install the additional\\nasterisk-sounds package. This was a separate compressed archive that you would\\ndownload, extract, and then install. As of Asterisk version 1.4.0, there are now two sets\\nof sounds packages: the Core Sound package and the Extra Sound package. Since Asterisk supports several different audio formats, these packages can be obtained in a\\nnumber of different sound formats, such as G.729 and GSM. The reason for all of the\\ndifferent formats is that Asterisk can use the sound format that requires the least amount\\nof CPU transcode. For example, if you have a lot of connections coming in on VoIP\\nchannels that are running GSM, you would want to have the GSM version of the sound\\nfiles. You can select one or more sound prompt types in the menuselect screen (discussed later in this chapter). We recommend that you install at least one type of sounds\\nfile from both the Core Sound package and Extra Sound package menu items. Since\\nwe may make use of some of the Extra Sound files throughout this book, we will assume\\nyou have at least one of the formats installed.\\n\\nLinux Package Requirements\\nTo compile Asterisk, you must have the GCC compiler (version 3.x or later) and its\\ndependencies on your system. Asterisk also requires bison, a parser generator program\\nthat replaces yacc, and ncurses for CLI functionality. The cryptographic library in Asterisk requires OpenSSL and its development packages.\\nZaptel requires libnewt and its development packages for the zttool program (see \"Using\\nztcfg and zttool later in this chapter). If you\\'re using PRI interfaces, Zaptel also requires\\nthe libpri package (again, even if you aren\\'t using PRI circuits, we recommend that you\\ninstall libpri along with zaptel).\\nIf you install the Software Development packages in CentOS, you will have all of these\\ntools.

Note that Asterisk will\\nno longer build correctly unless you have at least version 3.80 of GNU make.\\n\\nWhat Packages Do I Need? | 39\\n\\x0cObtaining the Source Code\\nThe best place to get source code for Asterisk and it\\'s packages is directly from the\\nhttp://www.asterisk.org web site or FTP server.\\n\\nRelease Versus Trunk\\nThe Asterisk code base is under a constant state of change. Developers use a sofware\\nrevision tool called Subversion (SVN) to manage the code base. Subversion allows a\\ncommunty of developers to collaborate with each other on complex programming\\nprojects.\\nThere are two main areas where Asterisk is developed, and these are referred to as the\\nBranch and the Trunk. In the Trunk, new features, architectural changes, and any of\\nthe brand-new stuff that is going on is performed. This place in the code base contains\\nall the new toys, but at any time can be in a nonworking state, and is absolutely forbidden from production use (see figure).\\n\\n\\nTrunk\\n\\nJust like a tree, a Trunk will have Branches. These Branches have the major revision\\nnumbers such as 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 (in the future we will likely see 1.6, 1.8, 1.8.2, 1.8.4.\\n1.8.6, 1.8.8. 1.8.8.2...um...etc...). Within the Branch there are no major architectural\\nchanges or new features--simply bug and security fixes. In a production environment,\\nstability is far more important than feature evolution.\\nRoughly every 14 months (although Asterisk does not follow a formal release timeline\\nlike many commercial software packages), a version of Asterisk is released intended for\\nuse in production environments. The first version of Asterisk was 1.0, which was released at the very first AstriCon in Atlanta in September of 2004. Asterisk 1.2 was\\nreleased at IP4IT in November 2005, and Asterisk 1.4 was released in December of\\n2006.\\n\\nObtaining Asterisk Source Code\\nThe easiest way to obtain the most recent release is through the use of the program\\nwget.\\n Subversion is an excellent code management system, available at http://subversion.tigris.org/. It also has an equally\\n\\nexcellent Creative Commons released book, Version Control with Subversion, by Ben Collins Sussman et al.\\n(O\\'Reilly), available online at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.\\n As of the release date of this book, there has been no determination that the next Asterisk release will be 1.6. It\\n\\ncould just as easily be 2.0. Therefore, when discussing new features, you\\'ll see us talk about what\\'s in Trunk or\\nwhat will be in the next release--without mentioning the specific version.\\n\\n40 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cNote that we will be making use of the /usr/src/ directory to extract and compile the\\nAsterisk source, although some system administrators may prefer to use /usr/local/src.\\nAlso be aware that you will need root access to write files to the /usr/src/ directory and\\nto install Asterisk and its associated packages.\\nSee Chapter 13 for information on running Asterisk as non-root. All\\nsecurity professionals will recommend that you run your daemons as a\\nnon-root user in case there are security vulnerabilities in the software.\\nThis helps to lower (but obviously does not eliminate) the risk of someone compromising the root user.\\n\\nTo obtain the latest release source code via wget, enter the following commands on the\\ncommand line:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\n\\nThe latest versions of the asterisk, libpri, and zaptel packages may not\\nnecessarily be the same version number.\\n\\nAlternatively, during development and testing you will probably want to work with the\\nlatest branch. To check it out from SVN, run:\\n# svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.4 asterisk-1.4\\n\\nIf you retrieved the described source code via the release files on the Digium FTP server,\\nthen extract the files as described in the next section before continuing on with\\ncompiling.\\n\\nExtracting the Source Code\\nThe packages you downloaded from the FTP server are compressed archives containing\\nthe source code; thus, you will need to extract them before compiling. If you didn\\'t\\ndownload the packages to /usr/src/, either move them there now or specify the full path\\nto their location. We will be using the GNU tar application to extract the source code\\nfrom the compressed archive. This is a simple process that can be achieved through the\\nuse of the following commands:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\ntar zxvf zaptel-1.4-current.tar.gz\\ntar zxvf libpri-1.4-current.tar.gz\\ntar zxvf asterisk-1.4-current.tar.gz\\n\\nObtaining the Source Code | 41\\n\\x0cIn bash (and other shell systems which support it), you can use an extremely handy feature called Tab completion. This will allow you to type\\npart of a filename and have the rest of it completed automatically. For\\nexample, if you type tar zxvf zap<tab> that will complete the full\\nzaptel filename for you. If more than one filename matches the pattern\\nand you hit Tab twice, it will list the files matching that pattern.\\n\\nThese commands will extract the packages and source code to their respective directories. When you extract the asterisk-1.4-current.tar.gz file, you will find that the file\\nwill extract to the current version of Asterisk, i.e. asterisk-1.4.4.\\nIt\\'s always a good idea to keep the source code of the most recently\\nworking version of a package in case you have to \"roll back\" out of a\\nnew bug introduced, or some other strange behavior you can\\'t solve\\nimmediately.\\n\\nMenuselect\\nIn the 1.4.0 version of Asterisk and its related packages, a new build system,\\nautoconf, was implemented. This has changed the build process slightly, but has given\\nmore flexibilty to control what modules are being built at build time. This has an advantage in that we only have to build the modules we want and need instead of building\\neverything.\\nAlong with the new build system, a new menu-based selection system was introduced,\\ncourtesy of Russell Bryant. This new system permits a finer-grained selection to which\\nmodules are built before compiling the software and no longer requires the user to edit\\nMakefiles. So instead of discussing how to use menuselect in every \"Compiling ...\"\\nsection, we will discuss it here, so when you see make menuselect you will understand\\nwhat to do once inside the menuselect configuration screen.\\nIn Figure 3-1, we see the opening menuselect screen for the Asterisk software. Other\\npackages will look extremely similar, but with less options. We can navigate up and\\ndown the list using the arrow keys. We can select one of the menu options by pressing\\nEnter or by using the right arrow key. The left arrow key can be used to go back.\\nFigure 3-2 shows a list of possible dialplan applications that can be built for use in\\nAsterisk. Modules to be built are marked as [*]. A module is marked as not being built\\nby [ ]. Modules that have XXX in front of them are missing a package dependency which\\nmust be satisfied before it will be available to be built. In Figure 3-2, we can see that\\nthe app_flash module cannot be built due to a missing dependency of Zaptel (i.e., the\\nZaptel module has not been built and installed on the system since the last\\ntime ./configure was run). If you have satisfied a dependency since the last time you\\n\\n42 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cFigure 3-1. Sample menuselect screen\\n\\nran ./configure, then run it again, and rerun menuselect. Your module should now be\\navailable for building.\\nAfter you have finished making changes to menuselect, type x to save and quit. q will\\nalso quit out of menuselect, but it will not save the changes. If you make changes and\\ntype q, your changes may be lost!\\n\\nCompiling Zaptel\\nFigure 3-3 shows the layers of interaction between Asterisk and the Linux kernel with\\nrespect to hardware control. On the Asterisk side is the Zapata channel module,\\nchan_zap. Asterisk uses this interface to communicate with the Linux kernel, where\\nthe drivers for the hardware are loaded.\\nThe Zaptel interface is a kernel loadable module that presents an abstraction layer\\nbetween the hardware drivers and the Zapata module in Asterisk. It is this concept that\\nallows the device drivers to be modified without any changes being made to the Asterisk\\nCompiling Zaptel | 43\\n\\x0cFigure 3-2. List of modules to be built\\n\\nsource itself. The device drivers are used to communicate with the hardware directly\\nand to pass the information between Zaptel and the hardware.\\nWhile Asterisk itself compiles on a variety of platforms, the Zaptel drivers are Linux-specific--they are written to interface directly with the\\nLinux kernel. There is a project at http://www.solarisvoip.com that provides Zaptel support for Solaris. There is also a project that is working\\nto provide Zapata drivers for BSD, located at http://www.voip-info.org/\\ntiki-index.php?page=FreeBSD+zaptel.\\n\\nFirst we will discuss the ztdummy driver, used on systems that require a timing interface\\nbut that do not have hardware. Then we will look at compiling and installing the drivers.\\n(The configuration of Zaptel drivers will be discussed in the next chapter.)\\n\\n44 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\n\\nchan_zap.so\\n\\n/dev/zap\\n\\nLinux kernel\\n\\nZaptel\\n\\nHardware driver\\n(wctdm)\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nFigure 3-3. Layers of device interaction with Asterisk\\nBefore compiling the Zaptel drivers on a system running a Linux 2.4\\nkernel, you should verify that /usr/src/ contains a symbolic link named\\nlinux-2.4 pointing to your kernel source. If the symbolic link doesn\\'t\\nexist, you can create it with the following command (assuming you\\'ve\\ninstalled the source in /usr/src/):\\n# ln -s /usr/src/\\'uname -r\\' /usr/src/linux-2.4\\n\\nComputers running Linux 2.6 kernel-based distributions do not usually\\nrequire the use of the symbolic link, as these distributions will search\\nfor the kernel build directory automatically. However, if you\\'ve placed\\nthe build directory in a nonstandard place (i.e., somewhere other\\nthan /lib/modules/ <kernel version> /build/), you will require the use of\\nthe symbolic link.\\nWhile Asterisk and the other related packages run on Linux 2.4.x kernels, development is done first and foremost on 2.6.x kernels and\\nsupport for 2.4.x kernels is not guarenteed in the future.\\n\\nThe ztdummy Driver\\nIn Asterisk, certain applications and features require a timing device in order to operate\\n(Asterisk won\\'t even compile them if no timing device is found). All Digium PCI hardware provides a 1 kHz timing interface that satisfies this requirement. If you lack the\\nPCI hardware required to provide timing, the ztdummy driver can be used as a timing\\ndevice. On Linux 2.4 kernel-based distributions, ztdummy must use the clocking provided by the UHCI USB controller.\\nCompiling Zaptel | 45\\n\\x0cMany older systems (and some newer ones) use an OHCI USB controller\\nchip, which is incompatible with ztdummy. However, if you\\'re using a\\n2.6 kernel there is no need to worry about which USB controller chip\\nyour system has.\\n\\nThe driver looks to see that the usb-uhci module is loaded and that the kernel version\\nis at least 2.4.5. Older kernel versions are incompatible with ztdummy.\\nOn a 2.6 kernel-based distribution, ztdummy does not require the use of the USB controller. (As of v2.6.0, the kernel now provides 1 kHz timing with which the driver can\\ninterface; thus, the USB controller hardware requirement is no longer necessary.)\\n\\nThe Zapata Telephony Drivers\\nCompiling the Zapata telephony drivers for use with your Digium hardware is straightforward; however, the method employed between the 1.2 and 1.4 versions is slightly\\ndifferent due to the new build environment. First we need to run ./configure in order\\nto determine what applications and libraries are installed on the system. This will ensure\\nthat everything Zaptel needs is installed. The following commands will build Zaptel\\nand its modules:\\n# cd /usr/src/zaptel-version\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake clean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake\\nmake install\\n\\nWhile running make clean is not always necessary, it\\'s a good idea to\\nrun it before recompiling any of the modules, as it will remove the compiled binary files from within the source code directory. You can also\\nuse it to clean up after installing if you don\\'t like to leave the compiled\\nbinaries floating around. Note that this removes the binaries only from\\nthe source directory, not from the system.\\nIn addition to the executables, make clean also removes the intermediary\\nfiles (i.e., the object files) after compilation. You don\\'t need them occupying space on your hard drive.\\n\\nIf you\\'re using a system that makes use of the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d/ directories\\n(such as CentOS and other Red Hat-based distros), you may wish to run the make con\\n\\n Note that this is configurable in the kernel, so it is possible certain distributions may not have this set to 1,000\\n\\nHz; CentOS, however, does have this set at the correct frequency.\\n\\n46 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cfig command as well. This will install the startup scripts and configure the system,\\nusing the chkconfig command to load the zaptel module automatically at startup:\\n# make config\\n\\nThe Debian equivalent of chkconfig is update-rc.d.\\nWhile Digium only officially supports Zaptel on Linux, several projects\\nto port Zaptel to other platforms should be noted:\\n Solaris (http://www.solarisvoip.com)\\n BSD (http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/asterisk-bsd)\\n\\nUsing ztcfg and zttool\\nTwo programs installed along with Zaptel are ztcfg and zttool. The ztcfg program is\\nused to read the configuration in /etc/zaptel.conf to configure the hardware. The\\nzttool program can be used to check the status of your installed hardware. For instance,\\nif you are using a T1 card and there is no communication between the endpoints, you\\nwill see a red alarm. If everything is configured correctly and communication is possible,\\nyou should see an \"OK.\" The zttool application is also useful for analog cards, because\\nit tells you their current state (configured, off-hook, etc.). The use of these programs\\nwill be explored further in the next chapter.\\nThe libnewt libraries and their development packages (newt-devel on\\nRed Hat-based distributions) must be installed for zttool to be compiled.\\nThe ztcfg and zttool applications, along with other useful utilities, are\\nlocated under the Utilities section of the Zaptel menuselect screen.\\n\\nCompiling libpri\\nThe libpri libraries do not make use of the autoconf build environment or the menuselect feature as they are unnecessary; thus, the installation is simplified. libpri is used\\nby various makers of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) hardware, but even if you\\ndon\\'t have the hardware installed, it is safe to compile and install this library. You must\\ncompile and install libpri before Asterisk, as it will be detected and used when Asterisk\\nis compiled. Here are the commands (replace version with your version of libpri):\\n# cd /usr/src/libpri-version\\n# make clean\\n# make\\n# make install\\n\\nCompiling libpri | 47\\n\\x0cCompiling Asterisk\\nOnce you\\'ve compiled and installed the zaptel and libpri packages (if you need them),\\nyou can move on to Asterisk. This section walks you through a standard installation\\nand introduces some of the alternative make arguments that you may find useful.\\n\\nStandard Installation\\nAsterisk is compiled with gcc through the use of the GNU make program. To get started\\ncompiling Asterisk, simply run the following commands (replace version with your\\nversion of Asterisk):\\n# cd /usr/src/asterisk-version\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake clean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake install\\nmake samples\\n\\nBe aware that compile times will vary between systems. On a current-generation processor, you shouldn\\'t need to wait more than five minutes. At AstriCon (http://\\nwww.astricon.net), someone reported successfully compiling Asterisk on a 133 MHz\\nPentium, but it took approximately five hours. You do the math.\\nRun the make samples command to install the default configuration files. Installing these\\nfiles (instead of configuring each file manually) will allow you to get your Asterisk\\nsystem up and running much faster. Many of the default values are fine for Asterisk.\\nFiles that require editing will be explained in future chapters.\\nIf you already have configuration files installed in /etc/asterisk/ when you\\nrun the make samples command, .old will be appended to the end of each\\nof your current configuration files, for example, extensions.conf will be\\nrenamed extensions.conf.old. Be careful, though, because if you run make\\nsamples more than once you will overwrite your original configuration\\nfiles!\\nThe sample configuration files can also be found in the configs/ subdirectory within your Asterisk sources directory.\\n\\nIf you\\'re using a system that makes use of the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d/ directories,\\nyou may wish to run the make config command as well. This will install the startup\\nscripts and configure the system (through the use of the chkconfig command) to execute\\nAsterisk automatically at startup:\\n# make config\\n\\n48 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cAlternative make Arguments\\nThere are several other make arguments that you can pass at compile time. While some\\nof these will be discussed here, the remainder are used internally within the file and\\nreally have no bearing or use for the end user. (Of course, new functions may have been\\nadded, so be sure to check the Makefile for other options.)\\nLet\\'s take a look at some useful make arguments.\\n\\nmake clean\\nThe make clean command is used to remove the compiled binaries from within the\\nsource directory. This command should be run before you attempt to recompile or, if\\nspace is an issue, if you would like to clean up the files.\\n\\nmake distclean\\nThe make distclean command is used to remove the compiled binaries and to clean\\nthe source directory back to its original state after being extracted from the compressed\\narchive.\\n\\nmake update\\nThe make update command is used to update the existing code from the Digium SVN\\nserver. If you downloaded the source code from the FTP server, you will receive a notice\\nstating so.\\n\\nmake webvmail\\nThe Asterisk Web Voicemail script is used to give a graphical interface to your voicemail\\naccount, allowing you to manage and interact with your voicemail remotely from a web\\nbrowser.\\nWhen you run the make webvmail command, the Asterisk Web Voicemail script will be\\nplaced into the cgi-bin/ directory of your HTTP daemon. If you have specific policies\\nwith respect to security, be aware that it uses a setuid root Perl script. This command\\nwill install only on a CentOS or Fedora box, as other distributions may have different\\npaths to their cgi-bin/ directories. (This, of course, can be changed by editing the\\nHTTP_CFGDIR variable in the Makefile at line 133 at the time of this writing.)\\n\\nmake progdocs\\nThe make progdocs command will create documentation using the doxygen software\\nfrom comments placed within the source code by the developers. You must have the\\nappropriate doxygen software installed on your system in order for this to work. Note\\nthat doxygen assumes that the source code is well documented, which, sadly, is not\\nalways the case, although much work was published since the first edition of this book!\\nThe information contained within the doxygen system will be useful only to developers.\\nCompiling Asterisk | 49\\n\\x0cmake config\\nThe make config command will install Red Hat-style initialization scripts, if\\nthe /etc/rc.d/init.d or /etc/init.d directories are found to exist. If they do exist, the scripts\\nare installed with file permissions equal to 755. If the script detects\\nthat /etc/rc.d/init.d/ exists, the chkconfig --add asterisk command will also be run to\\ncause Asterisk to be started automatically at boot time. This is not the case, however,\\nwith distributions that only use the /etc/init.d/ directory. Running make config will not\\ndo anything to an already running Asterisk process, or start one if it\\'s not running.\\nThis script currently is really only useful on a Red Hat-based system, although initialization scripts are available for other distributions (such as Gentoo, Mandrake, and\\nSlackware) in the ./contrib./init.d/ directory of your Asterisk source directory.\\n\\nUsing Precompiled Binaries\\nWhile the documented process of installing Asterisk expects you to compile the source\\ncode yourself, there are Linux distributions (such as Debian) that include precompiled\\nAsterisk binaries. Failing that, you may be able to install Asterisk with the package\\nmanagers that those distributions of Linux provide (such as apt-get for Debian and\\nportage for Gentoo).# However, you may also find that many of these prebuilt binaries\\nare quite out of date and do not follow the same furious development cycle as Asterisk.\\nFinally, there do exist basic, precompiled Asterisk binaries that can be downloaded and\\ninstalled in whatever Linux distribution you have chosen. However, the use of precompiled binaries doesn\\'t really save much time, and we have found that compiling\\nAsterisk with each install is not a very cumbersome task. We believe that the best way\\nto install Asterisk is to compile from the source code, so we won\\'t discuss prebuilt\\nbinaries very much in this bookand besides, don\\'t you want to be l33t?* In the next\\nchapter, we\\'ll look at how to initially configure Asterisk and several kinds of channels.\\n\\nInstalling Additional Prompts\\nAdditional prompts are installed via the menuselect application in your Asterisk source\\ndirectory. There are three sets of audio packages: Core Sound, Extra Sound, and Music\\nOn Hold File. Each set of packages is broken down into different formats (and the Core\\nSound packages are available in multiple languages). Using the menuselect application,\\n\\n# Gentoo doesn\\'t actually use a precompiled binary, but rather pulls the source from a repository, and builds\\n\\nand installs the software using its own package management system. But the version you get is still dependant\\nupon the maintainers packaging it for you, when you could simply build it yourself!\\n* l33t is a funny way of saying \"elite,\" known as leetspeak (computer slang). Even more funny is a well-written,\\n\\nserious article by Microsoft about leetspeak at http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/\\nleetspeak.mspx.\\n\\n50 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cyou can select combinations of audio packages for use in your environment. Some of\\nthe formats available include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWAV\\nlaw\\nalaw\\nGSM\\n\\nAs of this writing, the Core Sound packages are available in the following languages:\\n English\\n Spanish\\n French\\nSelecting any sounds in menuselect will cause the system to download\\nthe files from the Digium FTP server upon install. The size of these files\\nranges anywhere from 2 MB to 27 MB, so be aware of this when installing offline, or on slow and expensive links.\\n\\nOther Useful Add-ons\\nThe asterisk-addons package contains code to allow the storage of Call Detail Records\\n(CDRs) to a MySQL database. There is also code that allows Asterisk to natively play\\nMP3s (which we don\\'t recommend unless you have a powerful system with very few\\nphones on it). Some folks may also be interested in the interpreter that allows you to\\nload Perl code into memory for the life of an Asterisk process (which can be very helpful\\nif you have a large number of AGI calls to the Perl interpreter). Programs are placed\\ninto asterisk-addons when there are licensing issues preventing them from being implemented directly into the Asterisk source code, or when they are not considred mature\\nenough to be integrated with Asterisk.\\nThe http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asterisk/g729/ directory contains the code and registration program for the proprietary G.729A codec . If you install the g729 sounds packages,\\nAsterisk will be able to communicate with devices that natively support the G.729A\\ncodec, but will not be able to transcode between other codecs and G.729A until a license\\nis obtained to use it.\\n\\nCommon Compiling Issues\\nThere are many common compiling issues that users often run into. Here are some of\\nthe more common problems, and how to resolve them.\\nCommon Compiling Issues | 51\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\nFirst, let\\'s take a look at some of the errors you may encounter when running the\\nconfigure script.\\n\\nconfigure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\\nIf you receive the following error while attempting to run the configure script, you must\\ninstall the gcc compiler and its dependencies:\\nconfigure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\\n\\nThe following packages are required for gcc:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngcc\\ncpp\\nglibc-headers\\nglibc-devel\\nglibc-kernheaders\\n\\nThese can be installed manually, by copying the files off of your distribution disks, or\\nthrough the yum package manager, with the command yum install gcc.\\n\\nconfigure: error: C++ preprocessor \"/lib/cpp\" fails sanity check\\nThe following error will be displayed if no C++ preprocessor is found installed on the\\nsystem.

The scripts\\ncan be used to easily load and unload Asterisk and Zaptel. They will also run the\\n\\n54 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cchkconfig command for you so Asterisk and Zaptel will be started automatically upon\\n\\nsystem boot. The following shows their usage:\\n# service zaptel start\\n# service asterisk start\\n\\nEach initialization script has several options that can be utilized to control the PBX or\\nthe drivers.

The zaptel module does not require any configuration if it\\'s being used only for the ztdummy module. If you plan on loading the\\nztdummy module as your timing source (and thus, you will not be running any PCI\\nhardware in your system), now is a good time to load both drivers.\\n\\nSystems Running udevd\\nIn the early days of Linux, the system\\'s /dev/ directory was populated with a list of\\ndevices with which the system could potentially interact. At the time, nearly 18,000\\ndevices were listed. That all changed when devfs was released, allowing dynamic creation of devices that are active within the system. Some of the recently released\\ndistributions have incorporated the udev daemon into their systems to dynamically\\npopulate /dev/ with device nodes.\\n\\nLoading Zaptel Modules Without Scripts | 55\\n\\x0cTo allow Zaptel and other device drivers to access the PCI hardware installed in your\\nsystem, you must add some rules. Using your favorite text editor, open up your\\nudevd rules file. On CentOS, for example, this file is located\\nat /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules. Add the following lines to the end of your rules file:\\n# Section for zaptel\\ndevice\\nKERNEL=\"zapctl\",\\nKERNEL=\"zaptimer\",\\nKERNEL=\"zapchannel\",\\nKERNEL=\"zappseudo\",\\n\\nNAME=\"zap/ctl\"\\nNAME=\"zap/timer\"\\nNAME=\"zap/channel\"\\nNAME=\"zap/pseudo\"\\nNAME=\"zap/%n\"\\n\\nSave the file and reboot your system for the settings to take effect.\\nYou may not have to actually edit anything in your system, as the Zaptel\\ninstallation script will try to install the rules for you; however, we have\\nleft this here as a reference for those systems that are not automatically\\nconfigured.\\n\\nLoading Zaptel\\nThe zaptel module must be loaded before any of the other modules are loaded and used.\\nNote that if you will be using the zaptel module with PCI hardware, you must configure /etc/zaptel.conf before you load it. (We will discuss how to configure zaptel.conf for\\nuse with hardware in Chapter 4.) If you are using zaptel only to access ztdummy, you\\ncan load it with the modprobe command, as follows:\\n# modprobe zaptel\\n\\nIf all goes well, you shouldn\\'t see any output. To verify that the zaptel module loaded\\nsuccessfully, use the lsmod command. You should be returned a line showing the\\nzaptel module and the amount of memory it is using, as in the following:\\n# lsmod | grep zaptel\\nzaptel\\n\\n\\nLoading ztdummy\\nThe ztdummy module is an interface to a device that provides timing, which in turn\\nallows Asterisk to provide timing to various applications and functions that require it.\\nUse the modprobe command to load the ztdummy module after zaptel has been loaded:\\n# modprobe ztdummy\\n\\nIf ztdummy loads successfully, no output will be displayed. To verify that ztdummy is\\nloaded and is being used by zaptel, use the lsmod command. The following output is\\nfrom a computer running the 2.6 kernel:\\n\\n56 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0c# lsmod | grep ztdummy\\nModule\\nztdummy\\nzaptel\\n\\nSize\\n\\nUsed by\\n\\nIf you happen to be running a 2.4 kernel-based computer, your output from lsmod will\\nshow that ztdummy is using the usb-uhci module:\\n# lsmod | grep ztdummy\\nModule\\nztdummy\\nzaptel\\nusb-uhci\\n\\nSize\\n\\nUsed by\\n\\nLoading libpri Without Script\\nThe libpri libraries do not need to be loaded like modules. Asterisk looks for libpri at\\ncompile time and configures itself to use the libraries if they are found.\\n\\nStarting Asterisk Without Scripts\\nAsterisk can be loaded in a variety of ways. The easiest way is to start Asterisk by running\\nthe binary file directly from the Linux command-line interface. If you are running a\\nsystem that uses the init.d scripts, you can easily start and restart Asterisk that way as\\nwell. However, the preferred way of starting Asterisk is via the safe_asterisk script.\\n\\nConsole Commands\\nThe Asterisk binary is, by default, located at /usr/sbin/asterisk. If you\\nrun /usr/sbin/asterisk, it will be loaded as a daemon. There are also a few switches you\\nshould be aware of that allow you to (re)connect to the Asterisk CLI, set the verbosity\\nof CLI output, and allow core dumps if Asterisk crashes (for debugging with gdb). To\\nexplore the full range of options, run Asterisk with the -h switch:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -h\\n\\nHere is a list of the most commonly used options:\\n-c\\n\\nConsole. This will start Asterisk as a user process (not as a server), and will connect\\nyou to the Asterisk CLI. This option is good when you are debugging your startup\\nparameters, but should not be used for a normal system (if Asterisk is already\\nrunning, this option will not work and will issue a complaint).\\n-v\\n\\nVerbosity. This is used to set the amount of output for CLI debugging. The more\\n\"v\"s, the more verbose.\\n\\nLoading libpri Without Script | 57\\n\\x0c-g\\n\\nCore dump. If Asterisk were to crash unexpectedly, this would cause a core file to\\nbe created for later tracing with gdb. You generally do not use this in production,\\nunless you are writing code for Asterisk and want to debug any resulting crashes.\\n-r\\n\\nRemote. This is used to reconnect remotely to an already running Asterisk process.\\n(The process is remote from the standpoint of the console connecting to it but is\\nactually a local process on the machine. This has nothing to do with connecting to\\na remote process over a network using a protocol such as IP, as this is not supported.) This is the most common option and it is what you would use to connect to\\nAsterisk on a system where it is running as a daemon/service that was started by\\ninit at boot time.\\n-x \"<CLI command>\"\\n\\nExecute. Using this command in combination with -r allows you to execute a CLI\\ncommand without having to connect to the CLI and type it manually. An example\\nwould be to send a restart, which you would do by typing asterisk -rx\\n\"reload\" from the command line.\\nLet\\'s look at some examples. If you want to start Asterisk as a user program (because\\nyou are tweaking your config and will be starting and stopping it several times), and\\nyou want a verbosity level of 3, use the following command:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -cvvv\\n\\nIf the Asterisk process is already running (for example, if you have installed Asterisk as\\npart of the init process of the system), use the reconnect switch, like so:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvr\\n\\nIf you want Asterisk to dump a core file after a crash, you can use the -g switch when\\nstarting Asterisk:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -g\\n\\nTo execute a command without connecting to the CLI and typing it (perhaps for use\\nwithin a script), you can use the -x switch in combination with the -r switch:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"restart now\"\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"database show\"\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"sip show peers\"\\n\\nIf you are experiencing crashes and would like to output to a debug file, use the following command:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvvc | tee /tmp/debug.log\\n\\nNote that you do not have to use the v switch if you do not want the system to provide\\ndetailed output of what is going on. On a busy system, you may not want to get any\\noutput, as it can interfere with whatever you are doing on the console.\\n\\n58 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cDirectories Used by Asterisk\\nAsterisk uses several directories on a Linux system to manage the various aspects of the\\nsystem, such as voicemail recordings, voice prompts, and configuration files. This section discusses the necessary directories, all of which are created during installation and\\nconfigured in the asterisk.conf file.\\n\\n/etc/asterisk/\\nThe /etc/asterisk/ directory contains the Asterisk configuration files. One file, however\\n--zaptel.conf--is located in the /etc/ directory. The Zaptel hardware was originally\\ndesigned by Jim Dixon of the Zapata Telephony Group as a way of bringing reasonable\\nand affordable computer telephony equipment to the world. Asterisk makes use of this\\nhardware, but any other software can also make use of the Zaptel hardware and drivers.\\nConsequently, the zaptel.conf configuration file is not directly located in\\nthe /etc/asterisk/ directory.\\n\\n/usr/lib/asterisk/modules/\\nThe /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/ directory contains all of the Asterisk loadable modules.\\nWithin this directory are the various applications, codecs, formats, and channels used\\nby Asterisk. By default, Asterisk loads all of these modules at startup. You can disable\\nany modules you are not using in the modules.conf file, but be aware that certain modules are required by Asterisk or are dependencies of other modules. Attempting to load\\nAsterisk without these modules will cause an error at startup.\\n\\n/var/lib/asterisk\\nThe /var/lib/asterisk/ directory contains the astdb file and a number of subdirectories.\\nThe astdb file contains the local Asterisk database information, which is somewhat like\\nthe Microsoft Windows Registry. The Asterisk database is a simple implementation\\nbased on v1 of the Berkeley database. The db.c file in the Asterisk source states that this\\nversion was chosen for the following reason: \"DB3 implementation is released under\\nan alternative license incompatible with the GPL. Thus, in order to keep Asterisk licensing simplistic, it was decided to use version 1 as it is released under the BSD\\nlicense.\"\\nThe subdirectories within /var/lib/asterisk/ include:\\nagi-bin/\\nThe agi-bin/ directory contains your custom scripts, which can interface with Asterisk via the various built-in AGI applications. For more information about AGI,\\nsee Chapter 8.\\n\\nDirectories Used by Asterisk | 59\\n\\x0cfirmware/\\nThe firmware/ directory contains firmware for various Asterisk-compatible devices. It currently contains only the iax/ subdirectory, which holds the binary\\nfirmware image for Digium\\'s IAXy.\\nimages/\\nApplications that communicate with channels supporting graphical images look\\nin the images/ directory. Most channels do not support the transmission of images,\\nso this directory is rarely used. However, if more devices that support and make\\nuse of graphical images are released, this directory will become more relevant.\\nkeys/\\nAsterisk can use a public/private key system to authenticate peers connecting to\\nyour box via an RSA digital signature. If you place a peer\\'s public key in your\\nkeys/ directory, that peer can be authenticated by channels supporting this method\\n(such as the IAX2 channels). The private key is never distributed to the public. The\\nreverse is also true: you can distribute your public key to your peers, allowing you\\nto be authenticated with the use of your private key. Both the public and private\\nkeys--ending in the .pub and .key file extensions, respectively--are stored in the\\nkeys/ directory.\\nWhen you configure Asterisk for Music on Hold, applications utilizing this feature\\nlook for their MP3 files in the mohmp3/ directory. Asterisk is a bit picky about how\\nthe MP3 files are formatted, so you should use constant bitrate (CBR) encoding\\nand strip the ID3 tags from your files.\\nsounds/\\nAll of the available voice prompts for Asterisk reside in the sounds/ directory. The\\ncontents of the basic prompts included with Asterisk are in the sounds.txt file located in your Asterisk source code directory. Contents of the additional prompts\\nare located in the sounds-extra.txt file in the directory to which you extracted the\\nasterisk-sounds package earlier in this chapter.\\n\\n/var/spool/asterisk/\\nThe Asterisk spool directory contains several subdirectories, including\\ndictate/, meetme/, monitor/, outgoing/, system/, tmp/, and voicemail/ (see Figure 3-4).\\nAsterisk monitors the outgoing directory for text files containing call request information. These files allow you to generate a call simply by moving the correctly structured\\nfile into the outgoing/ directory.\\nCall files being placed into the outgoing/ directory can contain useful information, such\\nas the Context, Extension, and Priority where the answered call should start, or simply\\nthe application and its arguments. You can also set variables and specify an account\\ncode for Call Detail Records. More information about the use of call files is presented\\nin Chapter 9.\\n60 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cvar\\n\\nspool\\n\\nasterisk\\n\\noutgoing\\n\\nqcall\\n\\ntmp\\n\\nvoicemail\\n\\nFigure 3-4. /var/spool/asterisk/ directory structure\\n\\nThe dictate/ directory is the default location where the Dictate() application looks for\\nfiles.\\nThe meetme/ directory is the location where MeetMe() conference recordings are saved.\\nRecordings from either one-touch recording (the w and W flags to the Dial() application),\\nthe MixMonitor(), or Monitor() applications are stored in the monitor/ directory.\\nsystem/ is used by the System() application for temporary storage of data.\\nThe tmp/ directory is used, funny enough, to hold temporary information. Certain\\napplications may require a place to write files to before copying the complete files to\\ntheir final destinations. This prevents two processes from trying to write to and read\\nfrom a file at the same time.\\nAll voicemail and user greetings are contained within the voicemail/ directory. Extensions configured in voicemail.conf that have been logged in to at least once are created\\nas subdirectories of voicemail/.\\n\\n/var/run/\\nThe /var/run/ directory contains the process ID (PID) information for all active processes on the system, including Asterisk (as specified in the asterisk.conf file). Note\\nthat /var/run/ is OS-dependent and may differ.\\n\\nDirectories Used by Asterisk | 61\\n\\x0c/var/log/asterisk/\\nThe /var/log/asterisk/ directory is where Asterisk logs information. You can control the\\ntype of information being logged to the various files by editing the logger.conf file located in the /etc/asterisk/ directory. Basic configuration of the logger.conf file is covered\\nin Appendix D.\\n\\n/var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv\\nThe /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv directory is used to store the CDRs in comma-separated\\nvalue (CSV) format. By default information is stored in the Master.csv file, but individual accounts can store their own CDRs in separate files with the use of the\\naccountcode option (see Appendix A for more information).\\n\\nAsteriskNOWTM\\nIn the following sections we will provide a gentle introduction to the AsteriskNOW\\nsoftware, which gives you a complete PBX system with graphical configuration screen\\nall built into one!\\n\\nWhat Is AsteriskNOW?\\nAsteriskNOW is an open source software appliance, a customized Linux distribution\\nthat includes Asterisk, the Asterisk GUI, and all other software needed for an Asterisk\\nsystem.

If it did not, please take the time to go back and review the steps, consult the\\nwiki, engage the community, and get your system running.\\nUnfortunately, we cannot yet make any calls, because we have not yet created any\\nchannels. To get this plane to fly, we\\'re going to need some runways. While there are\\ndozens of different channel types, and dozens of different ways to configure each type\\nof channel, we just want to get some calls happening, so let\\'s try and keep things simple.\\nWe have decided to guide you through the configuration of four channels: a Foreign\\neXchange Office (FXO) channel, a Foreign eXchange Station (FXS) channel, a Session\\nInitiation Protocol (SIP) channel, and an Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX) channel.* We\\nselected these channel types because they are far and away the most popular channel\\ntypes in use in small Asterisk systems, and one of the goals of this book is to keep things\\nas simple as is reasonable. If we cover the basics of these channels, we will not have\\ndone an exhaustive survey of all channel types or topologies, but we will have created\\na base platform on which to develop your telecommunications system. Further scenarios and channel configuration details can be found in Appendix D.\\nOur first effort will be to explore the basic configuration of analog interfaces such as\\nFXS and FXO ports with the use of a Digium TDM11B (which is an analog card with\\none FXS port and one FXO port).\\n* Officially, the current version is IAX2, but since all support for IAX1 was dropped many years ago, whether\\n\\nyou say \"IAX\" or \"IAX2,\" you are talking about the same version.\\n This configuration used to be known as the Digium Dev-lite kit. For more information on FXS versus FXO,\\n\\nkeep reading. Put simply, this card will give us one port to connect to a traditional analog line from the phone\\ncompany (FXO), and one port to connect to an analog telephone (FXS), which is any type of phone that will\\nwork with a traditional home telephone circuit.\\n\\n\\x0cNext, we\\'ll tackle a few Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) interfaces: a local SIP and\\nIAX2 channel connected to a softphone or hardphone, along with connecting two Asterisk boxes via these two popular protocols.\\nFor SIP, we are going to cover Linksys, Polycom, Aastra, Grandstream, and Cisco sets.\\nIf we do not cover your phone model, we apologize, but what is important to realize is\\nthat while most of these devices have many different parameters that you can define,\\ngenerally only a few parameters need to be defined in order to get the device to work.\\nThat will be our goal, because we figure it\\'s a lot less frustrating to tweak a functioning\\ndevice than to get it perfectly set up on the first try. We won\\'t discuss all the features\\nyou may want your channel to have (such as caller ID or advanced codec and security\\nsettings), but you will be able to make and receive calls with your phone, which should\\nput a smile on your face--a good state to be in as we dig deeper into things.\\nOnce you\\'ve worked through this chapter, you will have a basic system consisting of\\nmany useful interfaces, which will provide the foundation we need to explore the\\nextensions.conf file (discussed in detail in Chapter 5), where the dialplan is stored\\n(technically, it contains the instructions Asterisk needs to build the dialplan). If you do\\nnot have access to the analog hardware, some of the examples will not be available to\\nyou, but you will still have configured a system suitable for a pure-VoIP environment.\\n\\nWhat Do I Really Need?\\nThe asterisk character (*) is used as a wildcard in many different applications. It is a\\ngood name for this PBX for many reasons, one of which is the enormous number of\\ninterface types to which Asterisk can connect. These include:\\n Analog interfaces, such as your telephone line and analog telephones\\n Digital circuits, such as T1 and E1 lines\\n VoIP protocols such as SIP and IAX\\nAsterisk doesn\\'t need any specialized hardware--not even a sound card--even though\\nit is common to expect a telephone system to physically connect to a voice network.\\nThere are many types of channel cards that allow you to connect your Asterisk to things\\nlike analog phones or PSTN circuits, but they are not essential to the functioning of\\nAsterisk. On the user (or station) side of the system, you can choose from all kinds of\\nsoftphones that are available for Windows, Linux, and other operating systems--or\\nuse almost any physical IP phone. That handles the telephone side of the system. On\\nthe carrier side, if you don\\'t connect directly to a circuit from your central office, you\\ncan still route your calls over the Internet using a VoIP service provider.\\n\\n ...and H.323 and SCCP and MGCP and UNISTIM\\n\\n70 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cWorking with Interface Configuration Files\\nIn this chapter, we\\'re going to build an Asterisk configuration on the platform we have\\njust installed. For the first few sections on FXO and FXS channels, we\\'ll assume that\\nyou have a Digium TDM11B kit (which comes with one FXO and one FXS interface).\\nThis will allow you to connect to an analog circuit (FXO) and to an analog telephone\\n(FXS). Note that this hardware interface isn\\'t necessary; if you want to build an IP-only\\nconfiguration, you can skip to the section on configuring SIP.\\nThe configuration we do in this chapter won\\'t be particularly useful on its own, but it\\nwill be a kernel to build on. We\\'re going to touch on the following files:\\nzaptel.conf\\nHere, we\\'ll do low-level configuration for the hardware interface. We\\'ll set up one\\nFXO channel and one FXS channel. This configures the driver for the Linux kernel.\\nzapata.conf\\nIn this file, we\\'ll configure Asterisk\\'s interface to the hardware. This file contains\\na slightly higher-level configuration of the hardware in the Asterisk user-level\\nprocess.\\nextensions.conf\\nThe dialplans we create will be extremely primitive, but they will prove that the\\nsystem is working.\\nsip.conf\\nThis is where we\\'ll configure the SIP protocol.\\niax.conf\\nThis is where we\\'ll configure incoming and outgoing IAX channels.\\nIn the following sections, you will be editing several configuration files. You\\'ll have to\\nreload these files for your changes to take effect. After you edit the zaptel.conf file, you\\nwill need to reload the configuration for the hardware with /sbin/ztcfg -vv (you may\\nomit the -vv if you don\\'t need verbose output). Changes made in zapata.conf will require\\na module reload from the Asterisk console; however, changing signaling methods requires a restart. You will need to perform an iax2 reload and a sip reload after editing\\nthe iax.conf and sip.conf files, respectively.\\nIn order to test the new devices we have defined, we must have a dialplan through which\\nwe can make connections. Even though we have not discussed the Asterisk dialplan\\n(that\\'s coming up in the next chapter), we want you to create a basic extensions.conf\\nfile so that we can test our work in this chapter.\\nMake a backup copy of the sample extensions.conf (try the bash command mv exten\\nsions.conf extensions.conf.sample), and then create a blank extensions.conf file (using\\nthe bash command touch extensions.conf), and insert the following lines:\\n\\nWorking with Interface Configuration Files | 71\\n\\x0c[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nIn the [general] section, we have set autofallthrough=yes, which tells\\nAsterisk to continue when an extension runs out of things to do. If you\\nset this to no, then Asterisk will sit and wait for input after all priorities\\nhave executed. This is most prevalent if the Background() application is\\nthe last application executed in an extension. If set to yes (which is now\\nthe default in 1.4), Asterisk will drop the call after Background() finishes\\nexecuting (at the end of the prompt(s) supplied to it). In order to force\\nAsterisk to wait for input after the Background() application finishes\\nplaying the voice prompts supplied to it, we use the WaitExten()\\napplication.\\nDo not be afraid if what we\\'ve just written doesn\\'t make a whole lot of\\nsense, as we haven\\'t explored the dialplan, applications, priorities, or\\nextensions yet (that is coming up in the next chapter). So for now, just\\nset autofallthrough=yes. It is safest to use the autofallthrough=yes\\ncommand as we don\\'t want Asterisk hanging around waiting for input\\nunless we explicitly tell it to do so.\\n\\nThere is nothing else for now, but we\\'ll be using this file as we go through this chapter\\nto build a test dialplan so we can ensure that all of our devices are working. Also, be\\nsure to run the dialplan reload command from the Asterisk CLI to update to the latest\\nchanges. Verify your changes by running the CLI command dialplan show:\\n*CLI> dialplan show\\n[ Context \\'phones\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\nInclude =>\\n\\'internal\\'\\n\\n[pbx_config]\\n\\n[ Context \\'internal\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'incoming_calls\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'default\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'parkedcalls\\' created by \\'res_features\\' ]\\n-= 1 extension (1 priority) in 5 contexts. =-\\n\\n72 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\n[res_features]\\n\\x0cYou will see the parkedcalls context because it is an internal context to\\nAsterisk, specified in the features.conf file.\\n\\nSetting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls\\nNow let\\'s expand upon the test dialplan we started in the previous section, allowing\\nus to dial back into the softphone after we have configured it and to use a dialplan\\napplication called Echo() that will allow us to test bidirectional audio. We\\'ll learn more\\nabout dialplans in Chapter 5, so for now, just add the italicized bits to your existing\\nextensions.conf file. We\\'ll be making use of this dialplan throughout the chapter, and\\nexpanding on it in certain sections. Once you\\'ve entered the text into extensions.conf,\\nreload the dialplan by running dialplan reload from the Asterisk console:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nFXO and FXS Channels\\nThe difference between an FXO channel and an FXS channel is simply which end of\\nthe connection provides the dial tone. An FXO port does not generate a dial tone; it\\naccepts one. A common example is the dial tone provided by your phone company. An\\nFXS port provides both the dial tone and ringing voltage to alert the station user of an\\ninbound call. Both interfaces provide bidirectional communication (i.e., communication that is transmitted and received in both directions simultaneously).\\n\\n Bidirectional communication is also known as full duplex in some circles. Half duplex means communication\\n\\nis only traveling in one direction at a time.\\n\\nSetting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls | 73\\n\\x0cIf your Asterisk server has a compatible FXO port, you can plug a telephone line from\\nyour telephone company (or \"telco\") into this port. Asterisk can then use the telco line\\nto place and receive telephone calls. By the same token, if your Asterisk server has a\\ncompatible FXS port, you may plug an analog telephone into your Asterisk server, so\\nthat Asterisk may call the phone and you may place calls.\\nPorts are defined in the configuration by the signaling they use, as opposed to the\\nphysical type of port they are. For instance, a physical FXO port will be defined in the\\nconfiguration with FXS signaling, and an FXS port will be defined with FXO signaling.\\nThis can be confusing until you understand the reasons for it. FX_ cards are named not\\naccording to what they are, but rather according to what is connected to them. An\\nFXS card, therefore, is a card that connects to a station. Since that is so, you can see\\nthat in order to do its job, an FXS card must behave like a central office and use FXO\\nsignaling. Similarly, an FXO card connects to a central office (CO), which means it will\\nneed to behave like a station and use FXS signaling. The modem in your computer is\\na classic example of an FXO device.\\nThe older Digium X100P card used a Motorola chipset, and the X101P\\n(which Digium sold before completely switching to the TDM400P) is\\nbased on the Ambient/Intel MD3200 chipset. These cards are modems\\nwith drivers adapted to utilize the card as a single FXO device (the telephone interface cannot be used as an FXS port). Support for the X101P\\ncard has been dropped in favor of the TDM series of cards.\\nThese cards (or their clones) SHOULD NOT be used in production environments. They are $10 on eBay for a reason.\\nThe X100P/X101P cards are poor cards for production use due to their\\ntendency to introduce echo into your telephone calls, and their lack of\\nremote disconnect supervision. Do yourself a favor and don\\'t waste your\\ntime with this hardware. You will find that if you ask the community\\nfor support of these cards, many responses will be hostile. You have\\nbeen warned.\\n\\nDetermining the FXO and FXS Ports on Your TDM400P\\nFigure 4-1 contains a picture of a TDM400P with an FXS module and an FXO module.\\nYou can\\'t see the colors, but module 1 is a green FXS module, and module 2 is an\\norange-red FXO module. In the bottom-right corner of the picture is the Molex connector, where power is supplied from the computer\\'s power supply.\\nPlugging an FXS port (the green module) into the PSTN may destroy\\nthe module and the card due to voltage being introduced into a system\\nthat wants to produce voltage, not receive it!\\n\\n74 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-1. A TDM400P with an FXS module (1 across) and an FXO module (2 across)\\nBe sure to connect your computer\\'s power supply to the Molex connector on the TDM400P if you have FXS modules, as it is used to supply\\nthe voltage needed to drive the ring generator on the FXS ports. The\\nMolex connector is not required if you have only FXO modules.\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection\\nWe\\'ll start by configuring an FXO channel. First we\\'ll configure the Zaptel hardware,\\nand then the Zapata hardware. We\\'ll set up a very basic dialplan, and we\\'ll show you\\nhow to test the channel.\\n\\nZaptel Hardware Configuration\\nThe zaptel.conf file located in /etc/ is used to configure your hardware. The following\\nminimal configuration defines an FXO port with FXS signaling:\\nloadzone=us\\ndefaultzone=us\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection | 75\\n\\x0cIn the first line, in addition to indicating whether we are using FXO or FXS signaling,\\nwe specify one of the following protocols for channel 2:\\n Loop start (ls)\\n Ground start (gs)\\n Kewlstart (ks)\\nThe difference between loop start and ground start has to do with how the equipment\\nrequests a dial tone: a ground-start circuit signals the far end that it wants a dial tone\\nby momentarily grounding one of the leads; a loop-start circuit uses a short to request\\na dial tone. Though not common for new installations, analog ground start lines still\\nexist in many areas of the country. Ground start is really a rather strange thing, because\\nit doesn\\'t exist in its analog form in Asterisk, so technically, there is no ground signal\\nhappening, but is rather a signaling bit that is intended for analog circuitry that historically would have been at the end of the T1. If this does not make much sense, don\\'t\\nsweat it; chances are you won\\'t have to worry about ground-start signaling. All home\\nlines (and analog telephones/modems/faxes) in North America use loop-start signaling.\\nKewlstart is in fact the same as loop start, except that it has greater intelligence and is\\nthus better able to detect far-end disconnects.# Kewlstart is the preferred signaling\\nprotocol for analog circuits in Asterisk.\\nTo configure a signaling method other than kewlstart, replace the ks in fxsks with either\\nls or gs (for loop start or ground start, respectively).\\nloadzone configures the set of indications (as configured in zonedata.c) to use for the\\nchannel. The zonedata.c file contains information about all of the various sounds that\\na phone system makes in a particular country: dial tone, ringing cycles, busy tone, and\\nso on. When you apply a loaded tone zone to a Zap channel, that channel will mimic\\nthe indications for the specified country. Different indication sets can be configured for\\ndifferent channels. The defaultzone is used if no zone is specified for a channel.\\n\\nAfter configuring zaptel.conf, you can load the drivers for the card. modprobe is used to\\nload modules for use by the Linux kernel. For example, to load the wctdm driver, you\\nwould run:\\n# modprobe wctdm\\n\\nIf the drivers load without any output, they have loaded successfully.* You can verify\\nthat the hardware and ports were loaded and configured correctly with the use of the\\nztcfg program:\\n Yes, there is such a thing as ground-start signaling on channelized T1s, but that has nothing to do with an\\n\\nactual ground condition on the circuit (which is entirely digital).\\n# A far-end disconnect happens when the far end hangs up. In an unsupervised circuit, there is no method of\\n\\ntelling the near end that the call has ended. If you are on the phone this is no problem, since you will know\\nthe call has ended and will manually hang up your end. If, however, your voicemail system is recording a\\nmessage, it will have no way of knowing that the far end has terminated and will, thus, keep recording silence,\\nor even the dial tone or reorder tone. Kewlstart can detect these conditions and disconnect the circuit.\\n\\n76 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# /sbin/ztcfg -vv\\n\\nThe channels that are configured and the signaling method being used will be displayed.\\nFor example, a TDM400P with one FXO module has the following output:\\nZaptel Configuration\\n======================\\nChannel map:\\nChannel 02: FXS Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 02)\\n1 channels configured.\\n\\nIf you receive the following error, you have configured the channel for the wrong signaling method (or there is no hardware present at that address):\\nZT_CHANCONFIG failed on channel 2: Invalid argument (22)\\nDid you forget that FXS interfaces are configured with FXO signaling\\nand that FXO interfaces use FXS signaling?\\n\\nTo unload drivers from memory, use the rmmod (remove module) command, like so:\\n# rmmod wctdm\\n\\nThe zttool program is a diagnostic tool used to determine the state of your hardware.\\nAfter running it, you will be presented with a menu of all installed hardware. You can\\nthen select the hardware and view the current state.

The zapata.conf file also controls the various\\nfeatures and functionality associated with the hardware channels, such as Caller ID,\\ncall waiting, echo cancellation, and a myriad of other options.\\nWhen you configure zaptel.conf and load the modules, Asterisk is not aware of anything\\nyou\\'ve configured. The hardware doesn\\'t have to be used by Asterisk; it could very well\\nbe used by another piece of software that interfaces with the Zaptel modules. You tell\\nAsterisk about the hardware and control the associated features via zapata.conf:\\n[trunkgroups]\\n; define any trunk groups\\n[channels]\\n; hardware channels\\n\\n* It is generally safe to assume that the modules have loaded successfully, but to view the debugging output\\n\\nwhen loading the module, check the console output (by default this is located on TTY terminal 9, but this is\\nconfigurable in the safe_asterisk script--see the previous chapter for details).\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection | 77\\n\\x0c; default\\nusecallerid=yes\\nhidecallerid=no\\ncallwaiting=no\\nthreewaycalling=yes\\ntransfer=yes\\nechocancel=yes\\nechotraining=yes\\n; define channels\\ncontext=incoming\\nsignaling=fxs_ks\\nchannel => 2\\n\\n; Incoming calls go to [incoming] in extensions.conf\\n; Use FXS signaling for an FXO channel\\n; PSTN attached to port 2\\n\\nThe [trunkgroups] section is used for connections where multiple physical lines are\\nused as a single logical connection to the telephone network, and won\\'t be discussed\\nfurther in this book. If you require this type of functionality, see the\\nzapata.conf.sample file and your favorite search engine for more information.\\nThe [channels] section determines the signaling method for hardware channels and\\ntheir options. Once an option is defined, it is inherited down through the rest of the\\nfile. A channel is defined using channel =>, and each channel definition inherits all of\\nthe options defined above that line. If you wish to configure different options for different channels, remember that the options should be configured before the channel\\n=> definition.\\nWe\\'ve enabled Caller ID with usecallerid=yes and specified that it will not be hidden\\nfor outgoing calls with hidecallerid=no. Call waiting is deactivated on an FXO line\\nwith callwaiting=no. Enabling three-way calling with threewaycalling=yes allows an\\nactive call to be placed on hold with a hook switch flash (discussed in Chapter 7) to\\nsuspend the current call. You may then dial a third party and join them to the conversation with another hook switch. The default is to not enable three-way calling.\\nAllowing call transfer with a hook switch is accomplished by configuring trans\\nfer=yes; it requires that three-way calling be enabled. The Asterisk echo canceller is\\nused to remove the echo that can be created on analog lines. You can enable the echo\\ncanceller with echocancel=yes. The echo canceller in Asterisk requires some time to\\nlearn the echo, but you can speed this up by enabling echo training (echotrain\\ning=yes). This tells Asterisk to send a tone down the line at the start of a call to measure\\nthe echo, and therefore learn it more quickly.\\nWhen a call comes in on an FXO interface, you will want to perform some action. The\\naction to be performed is configured inside a block of instructions called a context.\\nIncoming calls on the FXO interface are directed to the incoming context with con\\ntext=incoming. The instructions to perform inside the context are defined within\\nextensions.conf.\\nFinally, since an FXO channel uses FXS signaling, we define it as such with signal\\ning=fxs_ks.\\n\\n78 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cDialplan Configuration\\nThe following minimal dialplan makes use of the Echo() application to verify that bidirectional communications for the channel are working:\\n[incoming]\\n; incoming calls from the FXO port are directed to this context\\n;from zapata.conf\\nexten => s,1,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Echo()\\n\\nWhatever you say, the Echo() application will relay back to you.\\n\\nDialing In\\nNow that the FXO channel is configured, let\\'s test it. Run the zttool application and\\nconnect your PSTN line to the FXO port on your TDM400P. Once you have a phone\\nline connected to your FXO port, you can watch the card come out of a RED alarm.\\nNow dial the PSTN number from another external phone (such as a cell phone). Asterisk will answer the call and execute the Echo() application. If you can hear your voice\\nbeing reflected back, you have successfully installed and configured your FXO channel.\\n\\nConfiguring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone\\nThe configuration of an FXS channel is similar to that of an FXO channel. Let\\'s take a\\nlook.\\n\\nZaptel Hardware Configuration\\nThe following is a minimal configuration for an FXS channel on a TDM400P. The\\nconfiguration is identical to the FXO channel configuration above, with the addition\\nof fxoks=1.\\nRecall from our earlier discussion that the opposite type of signaling is used for FXO\\nand FXS channels, so we will be configuring FXO signaling for our FXS channel. In the\\nexample below we are configuring channel 1 to use FXO signaling, with the kewlstart\\nsignaling protocol:\\nloadzone=us\\ndefaultzone=us\\n\\nAfter loading the drivers for your hardware, you can verify their state with the use\\nof /sbin/ztcfg -vv:\\n\\nConfiguring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone | 79\\n\\x0cZaptel Configuration\\n======================\\nChannel map:\\nChannel 01: FXO Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 01)\\nChannel 02: FXS Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 02)\\n2 channels configured.\\n\\nZapata Hardware Configuration\\nThe following configuration is identical to that for the FXO channel, with the addition\\nof a section for our FXS port and, of the line immediate=no. The context for our FXS\\nport is phones, the signaling is fxoks (kewlstart), and the channel number is set to 1.\\nFXS channels can be configured to perform one of two different actions when a phone\\nis taken off the hook. The most common (and often expected) option is for Asterisk to\\nproduce a dial tone and wait for input from the user. This action is configured with\\nimmediate=no. The alternative action is for Asterisk to automatically perform a set of\\ninstructions configured in the dialplan instead of producing a dial tone, which you\\nindicate by configuring immediate=yes. The instructions to be performed are found in\\nthe context configured for the channel and will match the s extension (both of these\\ntopics will be discussed further in the following chapter).\\nHere\\'s our new zapata.conf:\\n[trunkgroups]\\n; define any trunk groups\\n[channels]\\n; hardware channels\\n; default\\nusecallerid=yes\\nhidecallerid=no\\ncallwaiting=no\\nthreewaycalling=yes\\ntransfer=yes\\nechocancel=yes\\nechotraining=yes\\nimmediate=no\\n; define channels\\ncontext=phones\\nsignalling=fxo_ks\\nchannel => 1\\n\\n; Uses the [internal] context in extensions.conf\\n; Uses FXO signalling for an FXS channel\\n; Telephone attached to port 1\\n\\n Also referred to as the Batphone method, and more formally known as an Automatic Ringdown or Private\\n\\nLine Automatic Ringdown (PLAR) circuit.

The relevant section, which should\\nalready exist in your dialplan, looks like this:\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nWhatever you say, the Echo() application will relay back to you.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones\\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), commonly used in VoIP phones (either hard\\nphones, or softphones), takes care of the setup and teardown of calls, along with any\\nchanges during a call such as call transfers. The purpose of SIP is to help two endpoints\\ntalk to each other (if possible, directly to each other). The SIP protocol is simply a\\nsignaling protocol, which means that its purpose is only to get the two endpoints talking\\nto each other, and not to deal with the media of the call (your voice). Rather, your voice\\nis carried using another protocol called the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP; RFC\\n3550) to transfer media directly between the two endpoints.\\nWe use the term media to refer to the data transferred between endpoints\\nand used to reconstruct your voice at the other end. It may also refer to\\nmusic or prompts from the PBX.\\n\\nIn the world of SIP, we call our endpoints user agents, of which there are two types:\\nclient and server. The client is the endpoint that generates the request, and the server\\nprocesses the request and generates a response. When an endpoint wishes to place a\\ncall to another endpoint (such as our softphone calling another softphone), we generate\\nour request and send this to a SIP proxy. A proxy server will take the request, determine\\n RFC 3261 is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt. While the document is fairly large, we strongly\\n\\nencourage anyone who wishes to become an Asterisk professional to read at least the first 100 or so pages of\\nthis document and to understand how calls are set up, as this knowledge will be imperative when you\\'re\\nlooking at a SIP trace (sip debug from the Asterisk console) trying to determine why your calls are not getting\\nset up correctly.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 81\\n\\x0cwhere the request is destined for, and forward it on. Once the two user agents have\\nnegotiated a successful call setup, the media is transported via the RTP protocol and\\nsent directly between the two user agents. SIP proxies do not handle media; they simply\\ndeal with the SIP packets.\\nAsterisk, on the other hand, is called a Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA). This means\\nthat Asterisk acts like a user agent in either the server (receiving) or client (sending)\\nrole. So when our softphone dials an extension number, the call is set up between the\\nsoftphone and Asterisk directly. If the logic we\\'ve built into Asterisk determines that\\nyou mean to call another user agent, then Asterisk acts as a user agent client and sets\\nup another connection (known as a channel) to the other phone. The media between\\nthe two phones then flows directly through Asterisk. From the viewpoint of the\\nphones, they are talking with Asterisk directly.\\n\\nBasic SIP Telephone Configuration in Asterisk\\nConfiguring a SIP phone to work with Asterisk does not require much. However, because there are so many options possible in both Asterisk and the configuration of the\\nparticular telephone set or softphone, things can get confusing. Add to this the fact that\\nsimilar things can have different names, and you have a recipe for frustration. What we\\nare going to do, therefore, is give you the bare-bones basics. If you follow our advice,\\nyou should be able to get the sets we cover working (and be well on your way to getting\\na phone that we have not covered to work as well). We are not saying that this is the\\nbest way, or even the right way, but it is the simplest way, and from a working foundation, it is much easier to take a basic configuration and tweak things until you get\\nthe solution you need.\\nJust as we did with the extensions.conf file; run the following commands\\nin your bash shell:\\n# mv sip.conf sip.conf.sample\\n# touch sip.conf\\n\\nDefining the SIP device in Asterisk\\nIf you put the following in a sip.conf file, you will be able to register a phone to the\\nsystem.\\n[general]\\n\\n An excellent open source SIP proxy is OpenSER, available at http://www.openser.org.\\n Yes, there are ways to making the media flow directly between the phones once the call is set up. This is done\\n\\nin the sip.conf file using either directrtpsetup=yes (an experimental option allowing the media to be\\nredirected in the initial call setup) or canreinvite=yes (where media initially goes through Asterisk until a reINVITE happens, at which point the media can be sent directly between the phones).\\n\\n82 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0ctype=friend\\ncontext=phones\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nNot pretty, not secure, not flexible, not fully-featured, but this will work.\\nEven though we have named this SIP device 1000, and we are probably going to assign\\nit that extension number, you should note that we could have named it whatever we\\nwanted. Names such as mysipset, john, 0004f201ab0c are all valid, popular, and may\\nsuit your needs better.# What we are doing is assigning a unique identifier to a device,\\nwhich will form part of the credentials when a call is placed using the SIP channel.\\nSince we want to be able to both send calls to the softphone and allow the client to\\nplace calls, we have defined the type as friend. The other two types are user and\\npeer. From the viewpoint of Asterisk, a user is configured to enter the dialplan, and a\\npeer is created for calls leaving the dialplan (via the Dial() application). A friend is\\nsimply a shortcut that defines both a user and a peer. If in doubt, define the type as\\nfriend.\\nThe host option is used to define where the client exists on the network when Asterisk\\nneeds to send a call to it. This can either be defined statically by defining something\\nlike host=192.168.1.100, or if the client has a dynamic IP address, then we set\\nhost=dynamic. When the host option is set as dynamic, and the client is configured to\\nregister, Asterisk will receive a REGISTER packet from the endpoint (i.e., telephone\\nset or softphone), telling Asterisk which IP address the SIP peer is using.\\nIf you do not trust your network, you should probably also force the use of a password\\nby adding the following to the device definition. This is one of those things that is not\\ntechnically necessary, but is probably a good idea:\\nsecret=guessthis\\n\\nConfiguring the Device Itself\\nIn the configuration menus of the phone itself (which could be via a web GUI, through\\nmenus on the phone itself, or possibly using configuration files that are stored on a\\nserver), the unique identifier (which in this case is 1000) again forms part of the credentials for the authentication process. Naturally, for a connection to be successful,\\nthis has to match in both Asterisk and in the set itself. The fun begins when you realize\\nthat there is no set rule as to what this identifier is formally called. We have elected\\nsimply to call it the Unique Identifier.\\n\\n# The maximum length of a username is 255 characters.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 83\\n\\x0cIn the SIP RFC (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3261.html), section 19.1\\ncalls this user token, \"the identifier of a particular resource at the host\\nbeing addressed,\" verbiage consistent with our usage of [1000] as the\\nset identifier in the sip.conf file of Asterisk.\\n\\nInstead, you will want to look for fields that are labeled user name, auth name,\\nauthentication name, and so on. The thing to remember is that since you know that the\\nAsterisk end of the equation is configured simply and correctly, you can experiment\\nwith the phone setting until you find a combination that works. This is much better\\nthan the usual suffering that new users go through, as they change settings in both\\nplaces and have no luck getting a phone to register.\\nWe\\'re gonna say it again: configure sip.conf in the simplest manner possible, and then don\\'t change your Asterisk configuration. Trust us; what\\nwe have written here will work. Get your set working (i.e., where you\\ncan make and receive calls), and you will be in a far better position to\\nbegin experimenting with different settings. We have seen too much\\nsuffering (including our own), and we want it to end.\\n\\nSimplifying sip.conf\\nThe sip.conf file (which was copied to the /etc/asterisk directory by the make samples\\ncommand we ran in the previous chapter) contains a large number of options and\\ndocumentation inside it, but the file is actually very minimal if you remove all the\\ncommented parameters. The default file really breaks down to just the following few\\nlines being uncommented by default:\\n[general]\\ncontext=default\\nallowoverlap=no\\nsrvlookup=yes\\n\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nDefault context for incoming calls\\nDisable overlap dialing support. (Default is yes)\\nUDP Port to bind to (SIP standard port is 5060)\\nbindport is the local UDP port that Asterisk will\\nlisten on\\nIP address to bind to (0.0.0.0 binds to all)\\nEnable DNS SRV lookups on outbound calls\\nNote: Asterisk only uses the first host\\nin SRV records\\nDisabling DNS SRV lookups disables the\\nability to place SIP calls based on domain\\nnames to some other SIP users on the Internet\\n\\n[authentication]\\n\\nThe [general] section contains the options that will apply to all SIP clients and trunks.\\nSome settings elsewhere are set only in the [general] section, and others can be set in\\nthe [general] section as defaults for all conditionals unless overridden. These options\\nare listed under the two columns labeled [users] and [peers] below the\\n[authentication] header.\\n\\n84 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cGenerally, the commented-out options will show you the default setting Asterisk uses,\\nor will tell you the default option in the option\\'s description.\\nYou can also check the current state of the SIP channel in Asterisk with the sip show\\nsettings CLI command.\\n\\nIf you are running Asterisk and a softphone on the same system (i.e.,\\nrunning an X-Lite softphone and Asterisk on a laptop or desktop), then\\nyou will need to modify the SIP port that client listens on. It will need\\nto be changed from 5060 to 5061 (or some other unused port) so that\\nAsterisk and the softphone do not interfere with each other.\\n\\nEssential Server Components\\nBefore we get into how to define these files, there are a few things that need to be\\nconfigured on your server. Running the right services on your network will ensure\\nyour Polycom sets can autoconfigure from the moment you plug them in. There\\'s a\\nlittle work involved here, but we promise that the payoff is worth it. Once you\\'ve done\\nthis a few times, it only really takes a few minutes on each new system, and going\\nforward, it\\'ll save you a lot of mucking about with web interfaces. When you take your\\nnew Polycom phone out of the box, plug it into your network, watch it autoconfigure\\nitself, and then successfully register with your Asterisk machine, you will know the sort\\nof joy that only geeks can experience.*\\nIt\\'s not really that complicated. Where we think people get confused is in making sense\\nof the various ways this can be achieved, because there are a lot of choices.\\n\\nDHCP server\\nTypically, a DHCP server is used to configure basic IP parameters for a device (IP address, default gateway, and DNS), but the DHCP protocol can actually pass many other\\nparameters. In our case, we want it to pass some information to the sets that will tell\\nthem where to download their config files from. Here is a sample config from a Linux\\nDHCP server that will do what is required:\\nddns-update-style interim;\\nignore client-updates;\\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\\noption routers 192.168.1.1;\\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;\\noption ntp-servers pool.ntp.org;\\n\\n* Typically, it\\'s at 4 A.M. on the morning of a critical 8 A.M. meeting, after having worked all weekend. Red\\n\\nBull is probably the most popular drink of the Asterisk developers. Dr. Pepper would be a close second. Red\\nBull, anyone?\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 85\\n\\x0coption time-offset -18000;\\n}\\n\\nKeep in mind that this assumes that the only things on this network are devices that\\nbelong to the phone system (this setup will hand out an IP address to any device that\\nrequests it). If you have a more complex environment, you will need to configure the\\nDHCP daemon to handle the various devices it is serving. For example, you might want\\nto devise a scope that restricts IP addresses in your voice LAN to Polycom phones. Since\\nall Polycom IP desk phones have 00:04:f2 as their OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), you might choose to restrict scope based on that.\\nIn a Microsoft DHCP environment, the tftp-server-name is referred to\\nas Boot server host name. It is defined under option 66.\\n\\nThe DHCP protocol is far more flexible than is often realized, because in most environments it is not used for complex provisioning tasks. With a little care and attention,\\nyou can devise a DHCP environment that serves both your voice and data devices and\\ngreatly simplifies administrative workload when adding new devices.\\n\\nFTP server\\nFTP is currently our favoriteway to configure Polycom sets. We would recommend it\\nover TFTP for any set that allows for both. To install it on your CentOS system, the\\nfollowing command will install VSFTPD, the Very Secure FTP Daemon:\\n# yum -y install vsftpd\\n\\nThen, in order to lock things down, we need to prevent anonymous logins with a simple\\nchange to the vsftpd config file, /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:\\n# anonymous_enable=NO\\n\\nRestart the server with service vsftpd restart. To ensure that the daemon runs after\\nevery reboot, run chkconfig vsftpd on.\\nNow, we have to create a user account and group for the sets to use. In this case, we\\nwill create an account for the Polycom sets:\\n\\n FTP is preferred over TFTP due to the ability of a Polycom phone to see timestamps on FTP files. This allows\\n\\nthe phone to avoid redownloading configuration files and firmware updates that it already has--thus\\nshortening boot time.\\n\\n86 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# groupadd PlcmSpIp\\n# useradd PlcmSpIp -g PlcmSpIp -p PlcmSpIp\\n# passwd PlcmSpIp\\n\\nSet the password to PlcmSpIp (the default FTP password for Polycom sets). This can\\nbe changed, but will then require manual configuration from each set in order to advise\\nthem of their nonstandard credentials.\\nFor added security, let\\'s make sure the FTP server keeps that account in a chroot jail:\\n# echo PlcmSpIp >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list\\n\\nThat pretty much does it as far as preparing the operating system to provide the required\\nservices to the phones.\\nIn the next few sections we have provided instructions for various popular SIP telephones. Choose the section that applies best to the phone that you are planning to use\\n(whether a hard- or soft-phone). You will note that we have given all of these phones\\nthe exact same unique identifier. If you plan on installing more than one of them, you\\nwill need to ensure that they have unique names, and be sure to update your sip.conf\\nfile to include those device definitions.\\n\\nCounterPath\\'s X-Lite Softphone\\nCounterPath\\'s X-Lite softphone has become very popular with the Asterisk community. It is simple, functional, easy on the eyes, and--most importantly--free.\\nIn this section we will be configuring the X-Lite softphone to connect to Asterisk.\\nThe IP address of the phone is 192.168.1.250, and Asterisk is located at 192.168.1.100.\\nThe X-Lite is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can obtain a copy\\nof X-Lite from http://www.counterpath.com/index.php?menu=download.\\nNow let\\'s configure our softphone for connecting to our Asterisk box. To configure XLite, click on the Settings button, as circled in Figure 4-2.\\nSelect System Settings  SIP Proxy  [Default], which will display the default configuration for the softphone. Configure the screen as shown in Figure 4-3.\\nIf you have not already started Asterisk, then start it now (see Chapter 3 for help installing and starting Asterisk). If Asterisk is running in the background, you can\\nreconnect to the CLI by running the following command:\\n# asterisk -rvvv\\n\\n You can get into assigning complex and unguessable passwords for the phones to use, but unless you are\\n\\ngoing to input the passwords into each phone manually, you\\'ll have to pass them their FTP username and\\npassword from the DHCP server. Any device that can get on the voice network can get the same information\\nfrom the DHCP server. We\\'re not telling you to ignore security; just don\\'t assume that creating separate\\npasswords for each phone is going to improve security.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 87\\n\\x0cSettings button\\n\\nFigure 4-2.

From what we can tell, they\\nbase this on one of two reasons: 1) The Polycom web-based interface is horrible, or 2)\\nthe automatic provisioning process is painful and confusing.\\nWith respect to item 1, we agree. The web interface on the Polycom phones has got to\\nbe one of the most annoying web interfaces ever developed for an IP telephone. We\\ndon\\'t use it, and we don\\'t recommend it.\\nSo that leaves us with some sort of server-based configuration. Fortunately, in this\\nregard, the Polycom IP phones are superb--so much so that we can pretty much forgive\\nthe web interface. Set configurations are stored in files on a server, and each set navigates\\nto the server, downloads the configuration files that are relevant to it, and applies them\\nto itself.\\n\\nDHCP server\\nIf you cannot control your DHCP server, you may have to manually specify the FTP\\nserver information on the phone. This is done by rebooting the set, pressing the setup\\nbutton before the set begins the load process, and specifying the address of the FTP\\nserver in the small boot menu that these phones offer.\\n\\nProtocol to use for downloading\\nThe Polycom phones are able to download their configuration by one of three protocols: TFTP, HTTP, and FTP.\\nRight off the bat we are going to tell you to avoid TFTP. It is not secure, and the set\\ncannot use date information to determine which versions of various files are the most\\ncurrent. It works, but there are better ways, and we are not going to discuss it further.\\nPolycom phones can pull their config data using HTTP as well, but it has not proven\\nto be popular, and so we are going to move on.\\n\\n Actually, it does serve one useful purpose, which is to allow you to log on to a set via a browser and query\\n\\nits configuration.\\n\\n90 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cFTP is currently the preferred method of allowing Polycom phones to obtain their\\nconfiguration. It works well, is fairly easy to configure, and is well supported by the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nFTP\\nFTP is currently our favorite way to configure Polycom sets. To install it on your CentOS\\nsystem, the following command will install VSFTPD, the Very Secure FTP Daemon:\\n# yum -y install vsftpd\\n\\nThen, in order to lock things down, we need to prevent anonymous logins, with a simple\\nchange to the vsftpd config file, /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:\\n# anonymous_enable=NO\\n\\nRestart the server with service vsftpd restart. To ensure that the daemon runs after\\nevery reboot, run chkconfig vsftpd on.\\nNow, we have to create a user account and group for the Polycom sets to use:\\n# groupadd PlcmSpIp\\n# useradd PlcmSpIp -g PlcmSpIp -p PlcmSpIp\\n# passwd PlcmSpIp\\n\\nSet the password to PlcmSpIp (the default FTP password for Polycom sets). This can\\nbe changed, but will then require manual configuration from each set in order to advise\\nthem of their nonstandard credentials.\\nFor added security, let\\'s make sure the FTP server keeps that account in a chroot jail:\\n# echo PlcmSpIp >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list\\n\\nThat pretty much does it as far as preparing the operating system to provide the required\\nservices to the phones.\\n\\nThe Polycom configuration files\\nWhile there seem to be a lot of different files that are needed to make a Polycom set\\nwork, they are each fairly easy to understand.\\nThe bootROM. This can best be described as the BIOS and operating system of the phone.\\nPerhaps there is a more technical explanation, but why make things confusing? The\\nbootROM should not need to be updated regularly, but it is good to keep an eye on\\nthe current releases to see if a newer bootROM has features that will be of benefit in\\nyour environment. This file will be named bootrom.ld.\\n You can get into assigning complex and unguessable passwords for the phones to use, but unless you are\\n\\ngoing to input the passwords into each phone manually, you\\'ll have to pass them their FTP user name and\\npassword from the DHCP server. Any device that can get on the voice network can get the same information\\nfrom the DHCP server. We\\'re not telling you to ignore security, just don\\'t assume that creating separate\\npasswords for each phone is going to improve security.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 91\\n\\x0cThe application image. Since Polycom sets are capable of supporting other VoIP protocols\\n(MGCP is supported, for example), the protocol that this set will employ forms part of\\nthe application image that the phone will download and run. If the image on the set is\\nalready correct, this file is not actually needed on the FTP server; however, it is common\\nto have this file available to ensure that the most recent version of the protocol is available for the sets to download. You will sometimes receive phones that are not running\\nthe latest version, so having the most current image will ensure that all sets are up-todate.\\nThe sip.cfg file. There is normally only one version of this file on a system, but it can be\\nnamed anything you want, and there can be as many different versions of this file as\\nare needed. For example, if you had an office where there were two different languages\\nin use, some users might prefer French on their set, and others English. In that case,\\nyou\\'d create a french.sip.conf file and an english.sip.conf file to handle each case. Name\\nthis file as you see fit, but pick a name that makes sense so that future administrators\\nhave a chance to make sense of your design choices.\\nThe master config file for each phone. This file is very simple and small. It is named to match\\nthe MAC address of each phone (so each set will need its own copy of this file) and tells\\nthe set what other files it needs to download in order to configure itself. This is the first\\nconfig file each set will read. In this file will be a reference to the application image this\\nset will use (currently named sip.ld), as well as the names of the XML files that have the\\nparameters for this phone (the .cfg files). A master config file for a set might look something like this:\\n\\'<?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\\'\\n\\'<!-- Default Master SIP Configuration File-->\\'\\n\\'<!-- Edit and rename this file to <Ethernet-address>.cfg for each phone.-->\\'\\n\\'<!-- $Revision: 1.14 $ $Date: 2005/07/27 18:43:30 $ -->\\'\\n\\'<APPLICATION APP_FILE_PATH=\"sip.ld\"\\nMISC_FILES=\"\"\\nLOG_FILE_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\nOVERRIDES_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\nCONTACTS_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\n/>\\'\\n\\nNote the name of the application file that we want this set to use, and the config files\\nthat it will be trying to find and apply.\\nThe set-specific config file. We recommend giving the phone1.cfg files names that make\\nsense. For example, SET<xxx>.cfg (such as SET201.cfg) to match the extension number of the phone, or FLOOR4CUBE23.cfg, or maybe BOB_SMITHS_IP430_SET.cfg,\\nor whatever seems best to you. What\\'s the best way to name them? We\\'re going to\\nanswer that question by asking a question. Let\\'s say you have 100 of these phones.\\nWhen you list the contents of the /home/PlcmSpIp folder, how do you want the 100\\nconfig files for the sets to appear?\\n\\n92 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cGotchas. Settings that are configured directly on the telephone will be stored on the\\nfilesystem of the set, and may take precedence over parameters passed in config files.\\nIf you are having any problems applying changes to a set, try reformatting the phone.\\nThis will force the set to accept the parameters contained in the config files.\\n\\nCisco 7960 Telephone\\nThe venerable old C7960 is now a part of VoIP history. One of the first SIP telephones\\nthat could actually be taken seriously, the only real complaint one can have about this\\nphone is the price: they are the Cadillac of SIP phones (meaning that they have all the\\nbells and whistles but are tough to justify at the price, and are a little out of date\\nsometimes).\\nIf you can get one of these, you are getting an excellent SIP telephone. If you buy one\\nnew, be prepared to pay.\\nOne of the ways this phone is out of date is the lack of remote provisioning from anything other than TFTP. TFTP has lost favor with networking professionals due to the\\nlack of authentication and encryption, but since it is the only method of remotely provisioning the phone, we are going to have to use the tftp-server daemon. We can install\\ntftp-server with the following command:\\n# yum install -y tftp-server\\n\\nOnce installed, we need to enable the server by modifying the /etc/xinetd.d/tftp file. To\\nenable the TFTP server, change the disable=yes line to disable=no.\\nservice tftp\\n{\\nsocket_type\\nprotocol\\nwait\\nuser\\nserver\\nserver_args\\ndisable\\nper_source\\ncps\\nflags\\n}\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\ndgram\\nudp\\nyes\\nroot\\n/usr/sbin/in.tftpd\\n-s /tftpboot\\nno\\n\\nThen start the TFTP server by running:\\n# service xinetd restart\\n\\nWe can verify the server is running with the following command:\\n# chkconfig --list | grep tftp\\ntftp:\\non\\n\\nAs long as tftp: on was returned, the server is up and running.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 93\\n\\x0cCisco phones by default are loaded with their own communication protocol known as SCCP (or Skinny). We will be showing you how to\\nconfigure the phone, but due to the proprietary nature of Cisco and its\\nphones, you will need to obtain the SIP firmware from your distributor.\\nAlso, there are both chan_sccp and chan_skinny modules for Asterisk,\\nbut they are beyond the scope of this book.\\n\\nWe will be registering our Cisco phone to the SIP friend we configured in \"Zaptel\\nHardware Configuration.\" The following configuration file should be saved into a file\\ntaking the format of SIP<mac>.cnf, where <mac> represents the MAC address of the\\ntelephone device you are configuring. Place this file into the /tftpboot/ directory on your\\nserver:\\n# Line 1 Configuration\\nline1_shortname: \"Jimmy Carter\"\\n# The phone label, displayed in the upper-righthand corner of the phone\\nphone_label: \"aristotle\" ; Has no effect on SIP messaging\\n# Phone password used for console or telnet access, limited to 31 characters\\nphone_password: \"cisco\"\\n\\nThen configure the address to register in the SIPDefault.cnf file, also placed in\\nthe /tftpboot/ directory of your server. proxy1_address will contain the IP address of\\nyour Asterisk server of where the phone should register for line 1. The image_version\\ncontains the version of the .loads and .sb2 files the phone will load into memory.\\n\\nWe need one additional file called OS79XX.TXT. This file contains only a single\\nlinethe .bin and .sbn file version to load into memory:\\n\\nIn order for our Cisco 7960 to use these files, we need to tell the phone where to pull\\nits configuration from. If using the DHCP server from your Linux server, you can modify\\nthe /etc/dhcpd.conf file in order to tell the phone where to pull its configuration from\\nby adding the line:\\noption tftp-server-name \"192.168.1.100\";\\n\\nwhich contains the IP address of the server hosting the TFTP server (assuming of course\\nthe TFTP server is configured at that address. This is the address we\\'ve been using for\\nour Asterisk server, and we again assume you\\'ve installed the TFTP server on the same\\nbox as Asterisk). See \"DHCP server\" for more information about configuring the DHCP\\nserver:\\n94 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cddns-update-style interim;\\nignore client-updates;\\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\\noption routers 192.168.1.1;\\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;\\noption tftp-server-name \"192.168.1.100\";\\noption ntp-servers pool.ntp.org;\\noption time-offset -18000;\\n}\\n\\nAlternatively, you can configure from the phone itself to manually use\\nan alternative TFTP server than that given by the DHCP server. To do\\nso, press the settings button, (on the G version of the Cisco phones, this\\nlooks like a square with a check mark inside of it; G means Global). You\\nwill then need to unlock the settings by pressing the 9 key. The default\\npassword is cisco. Once the phone is unlocked, press the 3 key on the\\ndialpad to enter the Network Configuration. Scroll down to option 32\\nand set the Alternate TFTP to YES. Then scroll up to option 7 and enter\\nthe IP address of the TFTP server you wish to boot from. Accept the\\nsettings and back out of the menu until the phone reboots itself. You\\ncan also use the *-6-settings three finger salute to reboot your phone at\\nany time.\\n\\nYou can watch the phone pull its configuration from the TFTP server by using tshark\\n(yum install ethereal). Filter on port 69 using the following command:\\n# tshark port 69\\n\\nYou should then be able to watch the network traffic from the phone requesting data\\nfrom your TFTP server.\\nIf all goes well, then you should see your phone registered to Asterisk!\\n\\nEver since they purchased Sipura Technologies, Linksys has been producing a line of\\neconomical VoIP telephones and ATAs (Analog Terminal Adaptors). Linksys has been\\nstealing a lot of business from Cisco. If you have read Clayton M. Christensen\\'s\\nThe Innovator\\'s Dilemma (HarperCollins), it becomes easier to understand Cisco\\'s\\nstrategy with respect to Linksys.\\nLinksys (and Sipura) products are well regarded for their excellent quality, especially\\nrelative to their price, but they are also famous for being painfully difficult to configure.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 95\\n\\x0c\\nThis is mostly because their configuration GUI offers hundreds of configurable parameters.\\nWe don\\'t care about that.

You\\'ll know this because the first lighted line button beside the LCD screen will change from orange to\\ngreen.\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan for Testing\\nIn order to allow our phone to call other phones (or, if a multiline phone, to call itself),\\nwe need to modify the extensions.conf file.

This gives you a large number of choices\\nfrom which to choose. Many of these service providers allow you to connect your Asterisk-based system to their networks,# and some of them are even running Asterisk\\nthemselves!\\n\\nConnecting to a SIP Service Provider | 97\\n\\x0cThe following configuration should get you connected with an Internet Telephony\\nService Provider (ITSP),* although it is impossible to know the unique configurations\\neach service provider will require from you, and ideally the provider will give you the\\nconfiguration required to connect your system with its own. However, not all are going\\nto support Asterisk, so we\\'re going to provide you with a generic configuration which\\nshould help you get on your way and, ideally, going in a matter of minutes:\\n[my_service_provider]\\ntype=peer\\nfromuser=my_unique_id\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 5060 for SIP signaling, and ports 10,000 through\\n20,000 for the RTP traffic. You can also narrow the range of RTP ports in the rtp.conf\\nfile located in /etc/asterisk. An excellent book on iptables firewalls is Linux Firewalls by\\nSteve Suehring and Robert Ziegler (Novell Press).\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT\\n# service iptables save\\n\\nBe aware that this will allow all UDP traffic from any source access to ports 5060 and\\n10,000 through 20,000.\\n\\nMost of the previous configuration may be familiar to you by now, but in case it\\'s not,\\nhere is a brief rundown.\\nBy defining the type as a peer, we are telling Asterisk not to match on the [my_serv\\nice_provider] name, but rather to match on the IP address in the INVITE message\\n(when the provider is sending us a call). The host parameter is the IP address that we\\'ll\\nplace our calls to, and the IP address we\\'ll be matching on when receiving a call from\\nthe provider.\\n# Be sure to check the policy of any service provider you are looking to connect with, as some of them may not\\n\\nallow you to use a PBX system with its service.\\n* Also known as a VoIP Service Provider (VSP).\\n\\n98 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cMatching on Username Instead of IP Address\\nSome service providers may insteadSession Initiation Protocol be sending their calls to\\nyou via multiple IP addresses, requiring you to create a separate peer account for each\\nIP address. If you don\\'t know each of these IP addresses, you may need to match on\\nthe username instead. The format for the service provider definition needs to only\\nchange slightly, but the biggest change to note is that you will need to set the [service_provider_header] as the username your service provider is going to send the call\\nto. We have also changed the type from a peer to a friend, which from the viewpoint\\nof Asterisk creates both a type user and type peer, where the type user will be matched\\nbefore the peer:\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=friend\\nfromuser=my_unique_id\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nNote that we\\'ve removed the deny and permit parameters since we may not know the\\nIP addresses the calls will be coming from. If you do happen to know them and still\\nwish to match them, you can add back in the deny and permit(s) for the IP addresses.\\n\\nThe fromuser parameter is going to affect the way our INVITE message is structured\\nwhen sending the call to the provider. By setting our username in the fromuser parameter, we will modify the From: and Contact: fields of the INVITE when sending a call\\nto the provider. This may be required by the provider if it\\'s using these fields as part of\\nits authentication routine. You can see the places Asterisk modifies the header in the\\nnext two code blocks.\\nWithout the fromuser:\\nAudio is at 66.135.99.122 port 18154\\nAdding codec 0x2 (gsm) to SDP\\nAdding codec 0x4 (ulaw) to SDP\\nAdding non-codec 0x1 (telephone-event) to SDP\\nReliably Transmitting (no NAT) to 10.251.55.100:5060:\\nFrom: \"asterisk\" <sip:asterisk@66.135.99.122>;tag=as4975f3ff\\nCSeq: 102 INVITE\\nUser-Agent: Asterisk PBX\\n\\nConnecting to a SIP Service Provider | 99\\n\\x0cAllow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY\\nSupported: replaces\\nContent-Type: application/sdp\\n\\nWith the fromuser:\\nAudio is at 66.135.99.122 port 11700\\nAdding codec 0x2 (gsm) to SDP\\nAdding codec 0x4 (ulaw) to SDP\\nAdding non-codec 0x1 (telephone-event) to SDP\\nReliably Transmitting (no NAT) to 10.251.55.100:5060:\\nFrom: \"asterisk\" <sip:my_unique_id@66.135.99.122>;tag=as3186c1ba\\nCSeq: 102 INVITE\\nUser-Agent: Asterisk PBX\\nAllow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY\\nSupported: replaces\\nContent-Type: application/sdp\\n\\nThe deny and permit statements are used to deny all incoming calls to this peer except\\nthe IP address defined by the permit parameter. This is simply a security measure used\\nto make sure nothing else matches on this peer except traffic coming from the IP address\\nwe expect.\\nAt the end is insecure=invite, which may be required for your provider. This is because\\nthe source of the INVITE may originate from its backend platform, but could be directed through its SIP proxy server. Basically what this means is that the IP address that\\nthe peer is coming from, and which you are matching on, may not be the IP address\\nthat is in the Contact line: field of the INVITE message when you are accepting a call\\nfrom your provider. This tells Asterisk to ignore this inconsistency and to accept the\\nINVITE anyway.\\nYou may need to set invite=invite,port if the port address is also inconsistent with what Asterisk is expecting.\\n\\nNow we need one additional parameter set in the [general] section of our sip.conf file:\\nregister. register is going to tell the service provider where to send calls when it has\\na call to deliver to us. This is Asterisk\\'s way of saying to the service provider, \"Hey! If\\nyou\\'ve got a call for me, send it to me at IP address 10.251.55.100.\" The register\\nparameter takes the following form:\\n\\n100 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cregister => username:secret@my.service_provider.tld\\n\\nNow we just need to configure a simple dialplan to handle our incoming calls and to\\nsend calls via the service provider. We\\'re going to modify the simple dialplan we started\\nbuilding in the \"Setting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls\" section of this chapter.\\nThe italicized sections are the new parts that we\\'re adding to the dialplan, with everything else existing previously.\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\nexten => _X.,1.NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Dial(SIP/1000)\\n[outgoing_calls]\\nexten => _X.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Dial(SIP/my_service_provider/${EXTEN})\\n[internal]\\nexten => 1000,n,Dial(SIP/1000,30)\\nexten => 1000,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => outgoing_calls\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP\\nThere may come a time when you have a pair of Asterisk boxes, and you\\'d like to pass\\ncalls between them. Luckily this isn\\'t very difficult, although it does have some oddities\\nthat we need to deal with, but from the configuration viewpoint it isn\\'t really all that\\ndifficult.\\n\\n We also assume you have configured at least one SIP extension from the previous section.\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 101\\n\\x0cToronto\\n\\nOsaka\\n\\nFigure 4-5. SIP trunking topology\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 5060 for SIP signaling, and ports 10,000 through\\n20,000 for the RTP traffic. You can also narrow the range of RTP ports in the rtp.conf\\nfile located in /etc/asterisk.

At the end of this section,\\nyou will be able to set up a call from Alice to Bob (and vice versa) through your pair of\\nAsterisk boxes (see Figure 4-5). This is a common scenario when you have two physical\\nlocations, such as a company with multiple offices that wants a single logical extension\\ntopology.\\nFirst, let\\'s configure our Asterisk boxes.\\n\\nConfiguring Our Asterisk Boxes\\nWe have a pair of Asterisk boxes that we\\'re going to call Toronto and Osaka and that\\nwe\\'re going to have register to each other. We\\'re going to use the most basic sip.conf\\nfile that will work in this scenario. Just like the SIP phone configuration earlier in this\\nchapter, it\\'s not necessarily the best way to do it, but it\\'ll work.\\nHere is the configuration for the Toronto box:\\n[general]\\nregister => toronto:welcome@192.168.1.101/osaka\\n[osaka]\\n\\n102 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0ctype=friend\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=osaka_incoming\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nAnd the configuration for the Osaka box:\\n[general]\\nregister => osaka:welcome@192.168.2.202/toronto\\n[toronto]\\ntype=friend\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=toronto_incoming\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nMany of the previous options may be familiar to you by now, but let\\'s take a look at\\nthem further just in case they are not.\\nThe second line of the file tells our Asterisk box to register to the other box, with the\\npurpose of telling the remote Asterisk box where to send calls when it wishes to send\\na call to our local Asterisk box. Remember how we mentioned a little oddity in the\\nconfiguration? Notice that at the end of the registration line we tag on a forward slash\\nand the username of the remote Asterisk box? What this does is tell the remote Asterisk\\nbox what digest name to use when it wants to set up a call. If you forget to add this,\\nthen when the far end tries to send you a call, you\\'ll see the following at your Asterisk\\nCLI:\\nhave <toronto>, digest has <s>\\n\\nSo by adding the forward slash and username, we tell the other end what to place in\\nthe Digest username of the Proxy Authorization field in the SIP INVITE message.\\nThe rest of the file is the authorization block we use to control the incoming and outgoing calls from the other Asterisk box. On the Toronto box, we have the [osaka]\\nauthorization block, and on the Osaka box, we have the [toronto] block. We define\\nthe type as a friend, which allows us to both receive and place calls from the other\\nAsterisk box. The secret is the password the other system should use when authenticating. The context is where incoming calls are processed in the dialplan\\n(extensions.conf). We set the host parameter to dynamic, which tells our Asterisk box\\nthat the other endpoint will register to us, thereby telling us what IP address to set up\\ncalls when we want to send a call to the other end. Finally, the disallow and allow\\nparameters control the codecs we wish to use with the other end.\\nIf you save the file and reload the SIP channel on both Asterisk boxes (sip reload from\\nthe Asterisk console), you should see something like the following, which will tell you\\nthe remote box successfully registered:\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 103\\n\\x0c*CLI>\\n\\n-- Saved useragent \"Asterisk PBX\" for peer toronto\\n\\nYou should see the status of the Host change from (Unspecified) to the IP address of\\nthe remote box when you run sip show peers:\\n*CLI> sip show peers\\nName/username\\nHost\\ntoronto/osaka\\n\\nDyn Nat ACL Port\\nD\\n\\nStatus\\nUnmonitored\\n\\nYou can verify that your own registration was successful by running sip show\\nregistry from the Asterisk console:\\n*CLI> sip show registry\\nHost\\nUsername\\nosaka\\n\\nRefresh State\\n\\nReg.Time\\n\\nNow that our Asterisk boxes are happy with each other, let\\'s configure a couple of SIP\\nphones so we can call between the boxes.\\n\\nSIP Phone Configuration\\nSee the \"Configuring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone\" section of this chapter\\nfor more information about configuring SIP phones with Asterisk. Below is the configuration for two SIP phones in the sip.conf file for each server, which we\\'ll be\\nreferencing from the dialplan in the next section, thereby giving us two endpoints to\\ncall between. Append this configuration to the end of the sip.conf file on each respective\\nserver.\\nToronto sip.conf:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nOsaka sip.conf:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nYou should now have extension 1000 registered to Toronto, and extension 1001 registered to Osaka. You can verify this with the sip show peers command from the\\nAsterisk console. Next, we\\'re going to configure the dialplan logic that will allow us to\\ncall between the extensions.\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan\\nNow we can configure a simple dialplan for each server allowing us to call between the\\ntwo phones we have registered: one to Toronto, the other to Osaka. In the \"Working\\nwith Interface Configuration Files\" section of this chapter, we asked you to create a\\n104 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0csimple extensions.conf file. We are going to build up a dialplan based on this simple\\nconfiguration. The dialplan for each server will be very similar to the other one, but for\\nclarity we will show both. The new lines we\\'re adding to the file will be italicized.\\nToronto extensions.conf:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(SIP/osaka/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[osaka_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nOsaka extensions.conf:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 105\\n\\x0cexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(SIP/toronto/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[toronto_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve configured your extensions.conf file, you can reload it from the Asterisk\\nconsole with the dialplan reload command. Verify your dialplan loaded with the\\ndialplan show command.\\nAnd that\\'s it! You should be able to place calls between your two Asterisk servers now.\\n\\nConfiguring an IAX Softphone\\nA major advantage of using the IAX2 protocol is that it is designed to be more friendly\\nto working within odd network configurations, especially working behind NAT. This\\nmakes it a fantastic protocol for softphone clients since they are often utilized on laptops\\nthat roam into many different networks, often with no control of the network itself\\n(such as when traveling between hotel networks).\\nThe Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX) protocol is usually used for server-to-server communication; more hard phones are available that talk SIP. However, there are several\\nsoftphones that support the IAX protocol, and work is progressing on several fronts\\nfor hard phone support in firmware. The primary difference between the IAX and SIP\\nprotocols is the way media (your voice) is passed between endpoints.\\nWith SIP, the RTP (media) traffic is passed using different ports than those used by the\\nsignaling methods. For example, Asterisk receives the signaling of SIP on port 5060 and\\nthe RTP (media) traffic on ports 10,000 through 20,000 by default. The IAX protocol\\ndiffers in that both the signaling and media traffic are passed via a single port: 4569.\\nAn advantage to this approach is that the IAX protocol tends to be better suited to\\ntopologies involving NAT.\\nThere exist many IAX-based softphones, but not so many hardware based phones. The\\nmost pronounced reason is because IAX2 is not yet an IETF standard, yet many people\\nhave become early adopters and have reaped the benefits.\\nAn excellent IAX2 softphone is idefisk, available at http://www.asteriskguru.com for\\nfree download. The authors have had excellent results with this softphone, and since\\nit runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, it is an excellent cross-platform\\nsoftphone to write about. We will be demonstrating version 1.31 in this book, although\\nversion 2.0 was recently released (April 2007) but is not yet available for Linux.\\n\\n The Asterisk Guru site is also an excellent source of documentation!\\n\\n106 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cConfiguring the Channel Configuration File (iax.conf)\\nLike the rest of this chapter, we\\'re attempting to get you up and running quickly with\\nthe smallest configuration file set possible in order to minimize the problems you may\\nhave in configuring your devices. Just like the sip.conf file, iax.conf requires only a few\\nsimple lines to get our IAX phone registered to Asterisk. Let\\'s take a look:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nYes, really, that\\'s all you need to get your softphone up and running. It\\'s not the most\\nsecure or feature-rich configuration (we\\'re not even using a password), but this will\\nwork.\\nIn the [general] section of our iax.conf file, we have a single option: autokill= yes. We\\nuse this option to avoid things from stalling when a peer does not ACK (reply) to our\\nNEW packet (new call setup request) within 2000 milliseconds. Instead of the reply to\\nvalue yes, you can set this to the number of milliseconds to wait for the ACK to our\\nNEW packet. You can control the autokill option for each individual peer by defining\\nqualify for those peers that you know may be on poor network connections.\\nThe rest of the file contains the definition for our softphone. We define the type as\\nfriend, which tells Asterisk we will send calls to this device and also accept calls from\\nthis device. A friend is a shortcut for defining a separate peer (send calls to the softphone), and user (accept calls from the softphone). We could also have defined\\nindividual definitions for the peer and user like so:\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=phones\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=peer\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve configured your iax.conf file, save the file and reload the IAX2 channel\\nmodule from your Asterisk console with module reload chan_iax2.so.

We also need to register to Asterisk so we can receive calls. To do this, Right-click\\non the icon in the top-left corner of the screen, which will open a drop-down menu.\\nSelect Account Options from the drop-down, which will bring up the screen shown in\\nFigure 4-7.\\n\\n108 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cStart by creating a new account on the softphone by clicking the New button and filling\\nout the relevant information. The Host should point to the IP address or domain name\\nof your Asterisk system, with the username matching that of the value located between\\nthe square brackets [ ] in your iax.conf file. Leave the password field blank, as we did\\nnot configure a secret in iax.conf, and the Caller ID and Number can be set to whatever\\nyou wish. If you want idefisk to register this account on startup, select the \"Register on\\nstartup\" checkbox. When done, click the OK button to save the new account.\\nIf you clicked the \"Register on startup checkbox,\" then the phone will attempt to register to Asterisk. On the Asterisk console you will see output telling you that the phone\\nhas registered:\\n-- Registered IAX2 \\'idefisk\\' (UNAUTHENTICATED) at 127.0.0.1:32771\\n\\nYou can verify your registration with the iax2 show peers command at the Asterisk\\nconsole:\\nlocalhost*CLI> iax2 show peers\\nName/Username\\nHost\\nMask\\nidefisk\\n\\nPort\\n\\nStatus\\nUnmonitored\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan for Testing\\nOne final thing to do is confirm dialing through our phone by configuring a simple\\ndialplan in extensions.conf. You can simply test that you have audio in both directions\\nby calling extension 500, or you can modify the dialplan we created in the \"Setting Up\\nthe Dialplan for Some Test Calls\" section of this chapter to place some test calls. If you\\nalso configured a SIP phone at extension 1000 in the previous sections, then the following will not overlap with that, as we\\'ll be using extension 1001 (unless you\\nconfigured multiple SIP extensions, in which case just configure a unique extension\\nnumber for your IAX2 softphone):\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n\\nConfiguring an IAX Softphone | 109\\n\\x0cexten => 1001,n,Dial(IAX2/idefisk,30)\\nexten => 1001,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => phones\\n\\nConnecting to an IAX Service Provider\\nSome Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSPs) provide the ability to originate and\\nterminate calls via the IAX2 protocol. Beyond minimizing the number of ports required\\nto be open on the firewall (IAX2 only requires a single port for both signaling and\\nmedia), the protocol\\'s trunking feature is attractive to both ITSPs and their customers\\ndue to the savings in bandwidth that can be obtained when running many simultaneous\\ncalls between endpoints.\\nIf your ITSP is offering IAX2 termination, there is a strong chance it is running Asterisk;\\nthus the configuration for connecting to these service providers is more than likely going\\nto be similar to what we are providing here.\\nThe following configuration is a template for connecting to an IAX2 service provider:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => username:password@my.service-provider.tld\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=user\\nsecret=my_unique_password\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ntrunking=yes\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=peer\\ntrunking=yes\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nTo accept incoming calls from the Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number that your service provider assigned to you, we need to modify our extensions.conf file. Perhaps you\\nwant to send the call to an auto-attendant, or maybe simply to your desk phone. In\\neither case, you can accept calls from your service provider and match on the incoming\\nDID with the following bit of dialplan logic:\\n\\n110 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\nexten => 14165551212,1,NoOp()\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Dial(SIP/1000,30)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 4165551212,1,Goto(1${EXTEN})\\n[internal]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX\\nOften it is desirable to connect two physical Asterisk boxes together via IAX in order\\nto send calls between two physical locations (the distance between these locations may\\nbe centimeters or kilometers). One of the advantages to using the IAX protocol to do\\nthis is a feature called trunking, which utilizes a method of sending the voice data for\\nmultiple calls at once with a single header. This has little effect on only one or two\\nsimultaneous calls, but if you are sending tens or hundreds of calls between two locations, the bandwidth savings by utilizing trunking can be tremendous.\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 4569 for the IAX2 protocol. An excellent book\\non iptables firewalls is Linux Firewalls by Steve Suehring and Robert Ziegler (Novell\\nPress).\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 4569 -j ACCEPT\\n# service iptables save\\n\\nBe aware that this will allow all UDP traffic from any source access to port 4569.\\n\\nYou will need a timing interface installed on your system, whether it be\\nhardware from Digium or via the kernel by using the ztdummy driver.\\nThis will require you to have Zaptel installed on your system and running. See Chapter 3 for more information about installing Zaptel.\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX | 111\\n\\x0cConfiguring Our Asterisk Boxes\\nWe\\'ll be utilizing a simple topology where we have two Asterisk boxes registered to\\neach other directly, and separate phones registered to each Asterisk box. We\\'ll call the\\ntwo Asterisk boxes Toronto and Osakafi (see \"Connecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP\"). Bob\\'s phone will be registered and connected to Toronto, while Alice\\'s\\nphone will be registered and connected to Osaka.\\nThe first thing we want to do is create a new channel file (iax.conf) by renaming the\\ncurrent sample file to iax.conf.sample and creating a new blank iax.conf:\\n# cd /etc/asterisk\\n# mv iax.conf iax.conf.sample\\n# touch iax.conf\\n\\nNext, open up the iax.conf file and enter the following configuration on the Toronto\\nAsterisk box:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => toronto:welcome@192.168.1.107\\n[osaka]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ntrunk=yes\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=incoming_osaka\\n\\nautokill=yes was explained in the previous section, but its purpose is to make sure new\\n\\ncalls being set up to a remote system that are not acknowledged within a reasonable\\namount of time (two seconds by default) are torn down correctly. This saves us from\\nhaving a lot of hung channels simply waiting for an acknowledgement that probably\\nisn\\'t coming.\\nThe register line is used to tell the remote Asterisk box where we are so that when the\\nbox at 192.168.1.107 is ready to send us a call, it sends it to our IP address (in this case\\nour IP address is 192.168.1.104, which you\\'ll see in the iax.conf configuration of the\\nOsaka box). We send the username Toronto and the password welcome to Osaka, which\\nauthenticates our registration, and if accepted, writes the location of our Asterisk box\\ninto its memory for when it needs to send us a call.\\nThe [Osaka] definition is used to control the authentication of the remote box and\\ndelivery into our dialplan. Osaka is the username used in the incoming authentication.\\nWe set the type to friend because we want to have both the ability to send calls to\\nOsaka and to receive calls from Osaka. The host option is set to dynamic which tells\\nAsterisk to send calls to the IP address obtained when the opposite endpoint registers\\nwith us.\\n112 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cIn the introduction to this section, we mentioned the possible bandwidth savings when\\nutilizing IAX2 trunking. It\\'s simple to enable this functionality in Asterisk, as we just\\nneed to add trunk=yes to our friend definition. As long as a timing interface is installed\\nand running (i.e., dummy), then we can take advantage of IAX2 trunking.\\nThe secret is straightforward: it\\'s our authentication password. We\\'re defining the\\n[incoming_osaka] context as the place we will process incoming calls for this friend in\\nthe extensions.conf file. Finally, we block all IP addresses with the deny option from\\nbeing allowed to authenticate, and explicitly permit 192.168.1.107.\\nThe iax.conf configuration for Osaka is nearly identical, except for the changes in IP\\naddress and names:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => osaka:welcome@192.168.1.104\\n[toronto]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ntrunk=yes\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=incoming_toronto\\n\\nIAX Phone Configuration\\nIn the \"Configure the Softphone\" section, we configured our first IAX2 softphone using\\nidefisk. The configuration we\\'ll be using here is nearly identical except for minor\\nchanges in order to cause the peers to be unique. If you\\'ve already configured a SIP\\nsoftphone, then you can also utilize that on one (or both) of the peers. Remember that\\nAsterisk is a multiprotocol application, and you can send a call from a SIP phone to\\nAsterisk, across an IAX2 trunk, and then down to another SIP phone (or H.323, MGCP,\\netc.).\\nOn Osaka:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nOn Toronto:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX | 113\\n\\x0cNext, configure your IAX2 softphone to register to Asterisk. If the phone successfully\\nregisters, you\\'ll see something like:\\n*CLI>\\n\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan\\nIn order to allow calling between our two Asterisk boxes over the IAX2 trunk, we need\\nto configure a simple dialplan. The following dialplan will send all extensions in the\\n1000 range (10001999) to Osaka, and all extensions in the 2000 range (20002999)\\nto Toronto. Our example is going to assume that you have configured a pair of IAX2\\nsoftphones, but feel free to utilize a SIP phone if you\\'ve already configured one (or two).\\nJust be aware that you\\'ll need to change the Dial() application to send the call to the\\nSIP phone via the SIP protocol instead of IAX2 (i.e. Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30) instead of\\nDial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)).\\nThe extensions.conf file on Toronto:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/toronto/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[toronto_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nThe extensions.conf file on Osaka:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n\\n114 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/osaka/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[osaka_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nUsing Templates in Your Configuration Files\\nThere is a little-known secret in Asterisk config files that is so brilliant that we had to\\ndevote a little section to it.\\nLet us say that you have 20 SIP phones that are all pretty much identical in terms of\\nhow they are configured. The documented way to create them is to specify the parameters for each. Part of such a sip.conf file might look like this:\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nUsing Templates in Your Configuration Files | 115\\n\\x0cdisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\n\\nSeems like a lot of extra typing, cutting, and pasting, yes? And what if you decide that\\nyou are going to change the context for your sets to another name. Not looking good,\\nis it?\\nEnter the template. Let\\'s create the same SIP friends as we did above, only this time\\nusing the template construct:\\n[sets](!) ; <== note the exclamation point in parenthesis. That makes this a template.\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\n[1000](sets) ; <== note the template name in parenthesis. All of that templates\\n; settings will be inhereted.\\n\\nThis is one of the best kept secrets of conf file creation. In our experience, very few\\npeople use this, but for no other reason than that they don\\'t know about it. Well, that\\'s\\nabout to change. Our goal is to see everyone using these from now on; and yes, we will\\nbe checking.\\n\\nDebugging\\nSeveral methods of debugging are available in Asterisk. Once you\\'ve connected to the\\nconsole, you can enable different levels of verbosity and debugging output, as well as\\nprotocol packet tracing. We\\'ll take a look at the various options in this section.\\n\\nConnecting to the Console\\nTo connect to the Asterisk console, you can either start the server in the console directly\\n(in which case you will not be able to exit out of the console without killing the Asterisk\\nprocess), or start Asterisk as a daemon and then connect to a remote console.\\nTo start the Asterisk process directly in the console, use the console flag:\\n\\n116 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# /usr/sbin/asterisk -c\\n\\nTo connect to a remote Asterisk console, start the daemon first and then connect with\\nthe -r flag:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -r\\n\\nIf you are having a problem with a specific module not loading, or a module causing\\nAsterisk to not load, start the Asterisk process with the -c flag to monitor the status of\\nmodules loading. For example, if you attempt to load the OSS channel driver (which\\nallows the use of the CONSOLE channel), and Asterisk is unable to open /dev/dsp, you will\\nreceive the following error on startup:\\nWARNING[32174]: chan_oss.c:470 soundcard_init: Unable to open /dev/dsp:\\nNo such file or directory\\n== No sound card detected -- console channel will be unavailable\\n== Turn off OSS support by adding \\'noload=chan_oss.so\\' in /etc/\\nasterisk/modules.conf\\n\\nEnabling Verbosity and Debugging\\nAsterisk can output debugging information in the form of WARNING, NOTICE, and ERROR\\nmessages. These messages will give you information about your system, such as registrations, status, and progression of calls, and various other useful bits of information.\\nNote that WARNING and NOTICE messages are not errors; however, ERROR messages should\\nbe investigated. To enable various levels of verbosity, use set verbose followed by a\\nnumerical value. Useful values range from 3 to 10. For example, to set the highest level\\nof verbosity, use:\\n# set verbose 10\\n\\nYou can also enable core debugging messages with set debug followed by a numerical\\nvalue. To enable DEBUG output on the console, you may need to enable it in the\\nlogger.conf file by adding debug to the console => statement, as follows:\\nconsole => warning,notice,error,event,debug\\n\\nUseful values for set debug range from 3 to 10. For example:\\n# set debug 10\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf you\\'ve worked through all of the sections in this chapter, you will have configured a\\npair of analog interfaces, a local SIP and IAX2 channel connected to a softphone and/\\nor a hardphone, and placed calls across servers using the SIP and IAX2 protocols. These\\nconfigurations are quite basic, but they give us functional channels to work with. We\\nwill make use of them in the following chapters, while we learn to build more useful\\ndialplans.\\n\\nConclusion | 117\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nDialplan Basics\\n\\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not\\nsimpler.\\n--Albert Einstein (18791955)\\n\\nThe dialplan is truly the heart of any Asterisk system, as it defines how Asterisk handles\\ninbound and outbound calls. In a nutshell, it consists of a list of instructions or steps\\nthat Asterisk will follow. Unlike traditional phone systems, Asterisk\\'s dialplan is fully\\ncustomizable. To successfully set up your own Asterisk system, you will need to understand the dialplan.\\nIf you have attempted to read some sample dialplans and found them overwhelming,\\nor if you\\'ve tried to write an Asterisk dialplan and had no success, help is at hand. This\\nchapter explains how dialplans work in a step-by-step manner and teaches the skills\\nnecessary to create your own. The examples have been designed to build upon one\\nanother, so feel free to go back and reread a section if something doesn\\'t quite make\\nsense. Please also note that this chapter is by no means an exhaustive survey of all the\\npossible things dialplans can do; our aim is to cover just the fundamentals. We\\'ll cover\\nmore advanced dialplan topics in later chapters.\\n\\nDialplan Syntax\\nThe Asterisk dialplan is specified in the configuration file named extensions.conf.\\nThe extensions.conf file usually resides in the /etc/asterisk/ directory, but\\nits location may vary depending on how you installed Asterisk. Other\\ncommon locations for this file include /usr/local/asterisk/etc/\\nand /opt/asterisk/etc/.\\n\\nThe dialplan is made up of four main concepts: contexts, extensions, priorities, and\\napplications. In the next few sections, we\\'ll cover each of these parts and explain how\\n\\x0cthey work together. After explaining the role each of these elements plays in the\\ndialplan, we will step you though the process of creating a basic, functioning dialplan.\\n\\nSample Configuration Files\\nIf you installed the sample configuration files when you installed Asterisk, you will most\\nlikely have an existing extensions.conf file. Instead of starting with the sample file, we\\nsuggest that you build your extensions.conf file from scratch. This will be very beneficial,\\nas it will give you a better understanding of dialplan concepts and fundamentals.\\nThat being said, the sample extensions.conf file remains a fantastic resource, full of\\nexamples and ideas that you can use after you\\'ve learned the basic concepts. We suggest\\nyou rename the sample file to something like extensions.conf.sample. That way, you\\ncan refer to it in the future. You can also find the sample configuration files in\\nthe /configs/ directory of the Asterisk source.\\n\\nContexts\\nDialplans are broken into sections called contexts. Contexts are named groups of extensions, which serve several purposes.\\nContexts keep different parts of the dialplan from interacting with one another. An\\nextension that is defined in one context is completely isolated from extensions in any\\nother context, unless interaction is specifically allowed. (We\\'ll cover how to allow interaction between contexts near the end of the chapter.)\\nAs a simple example, let\\'s imagine we have two companies sharing an Asterisk server.\\nIf we place each company\\'s voice menu in its own context, they are effectively separated\\nfrom each other. This allows us to independently define what happens when, say, extension 0 is dialed: people pressing 0 at Company A\\'s voice menu will get Company\\nA\\'s receptionist, and callers pressing 0 at Company B\\'s voice menu will get Company\\nB\\'s receptionist. (This example assumes, of course, that we\\'ve told Asterisk to transfer\\nthe calls to the receptionists when callers press 0.)\\nContexts are denoted by placing the name of the context inside square brackets ([ ]).\\nThe name can be made up of the letters A through Z (upper- and lowercase), the numbers 0 through 9, and the hyphen and underscore.* For example, a context for incoming\\ncalls looks like this:\\n[incoming]\\n\\n* Please note that the space is conspicuously absent from the list of allowed characters. Don\\'t use spaces in\\n\\nyour context names--you won\\'t like the result!\\n\\n120 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cContext names have a maximum length of 79 characters (80 characters\\n1 terminating null)\\n\\nAll of the instructions placed after a context definition are part of that context, until\\nthe next context is defined. At the beginning of the dialplan, there are two special\\ncontexts named [general] and [globals]. The [general] section contains a list of general dialplan settings (which you\\'ll probably never have to worry about), and we will\\ndiscuss the [globals] context the \"Global variables\" section; for now it\\'s just important\\nto know that these two contexts are special. As long as you avoid the names [gen\\neral] and [globals], you may name your contexts anything you like.\\nWhen you define a channel (which is how you connect things to the system), one of\\nthe parameters that is defined in the channel definition is the context. In other words,\\nthe context is the point in the dialplan where connections from that channel will begin.\\nAnother important use of contexts (perhaps the most important) is to provide security.\\nBy using contexts correctly, you can give certain callers access to features (such as longdistance calling) that aren\\'t made available to others. If you don\\'t design your dialplan\\ncarefully, you may inadvertently allow others to fraudulently use your system. Please\\nkeep this in mind as you build your Asterisk system.\\nThe doc/ subdirectory of the Asterisk source code contains a very important file named security.txt, which outlines several steps you should\\ntake to keep your Asterisk system secure. It is vitally important that you\\nread and understand this file. If you ignore the security precautions\\noutlined there, you may end up allowing anyone and everyone to make\\nlong-distance or toll calls at your expense!\\nIf you don\\'t take the security of your Asterisk system seriously, you may\\nend up paying--literally! Please take the time and effort to secure your\\nsystem from toll fraud.\\n\\nExtensions\\nIn the world of telecommunications, the word extension usually refers to a numeric\\nidentifier given to a line that rings a particular phone. In Asterisk, however, an extension\\nis far more powerful, as it defines a unique series of steps (each step containing an\\napplication) that Asterisk will take that call through. Within each context, we can define\\nas many (or few) extensions as required. When a particular extension is triggered (by\\nan incoming call or by digits being dialed on a channel), Asterisk will follow the steps\\ndefined for that extension. It is the extensions, therefore, that specify what happens to\\ncalls as they make their way through the dialplan. Although extensions can certainly\\nbe used to specify phone extensions in the traditional sense (i.e., extension 153 will\\n\\nDialplan Syntax | 121\\n\\x0ccause the SIP telephone set on John\\'s desk to ring), in an Asterisk dialplan, they can be\\nused for much more.\\nThe syntax for an extension is the word exten, followed by an arrow formed by the\\nequals sign and the greater-than sign, like this:\\nexten =>\\n\\nThis is followed by the name (or number) of the extension. When dealing with traditional telephone systems, we tend to think of extensions as the numbers you would\\ndial to make another phone ring. In Asterisk, you get a whole lot more; for example,\\nextension names can be any combination of numbers and letters. Over the course of\\nthis chapter and the next, we\\'ll use both numeric and alphanumeric extensions.\\nAssigning names to extensions may seem like a revolutionary concept,\\nbut when you realize that many VoIP transports support (or even actively encourage) dialing by name or email address instead of only\\ndialing by number, it makes perfect sense. This is one of the features\\nthat makes Asterisk so flexible and powerful.\\n\\nA complete extension is composed of three components:\\n The name (or number) of the extension\\n The priority (each extension can include multiple steps; the step number is called\\nthe \"priority\")\\n The application (or command) that performs some action on the call\\nThese three components are separated by commas, like this:\\nexten => name,priority,application()\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example of what a real extension might look like:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\n\\nIn this example, the extension name is 123, the priority is 1, and the application is\\nAnswer(). Now, let\\'s move ahead and explain priorities and applications.\\n\\nPriorities\\nEach extension can have multiple steps, called priorities. Each priority is numbered\\nsequentially, starting with 1, and executes one specific application. As an example, the\\nfollowing extension would answer the phone (in priority number 1), and then hang it\\nup (in priority number 2):\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,Hangup()\\n\\n122 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cDon\\'t worry if you don\\'t understand what Answer() and Hangup() are--we\\'ll cover\\nthem shortly. The key point to remember here is that for a particular extension, Asterisk\\nfollows the priorities in order.\\n\\nUnnumbered priorities\\nIn older releases of Asterisk, the numbering of priorities caused a lot of problems.\\nImagine having an extension that had 15 priorities, and then needing to add something\\nat step 2. All of the subsequent priorities would have to be manually renumbered.\\nAsterisk does not handle missing steps or misnumbered priorities, and debugging these\\ntypes of errors was pointless and frustrating.\\nBeginning with version 1.2, Asterisk addressed this problem. It introduced the use of\\nthe n priority, which stands for \"next.\" Each time Asterisk encounters a priority named\\nn, it takes the number of the previous priority and adds 1. This makes it easier to make\\nchanges to your dialplan, as you don\\'t have to keep renumbering all your steps. For\\nexample, your dialplan might look something like this:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n123,n,do something else\\n123,n,do one last thing\\n\\nInternally, Asterisk will calculate the next priority number every time it encounters an\\nn. You should note, however, that you must always specify priority number 1. If you\\naccidentally put an n instead of 1 for the first priority, you\\'ll find that the extension will\\nnot be available.\\n\\nPriority labels\\nStarting with Asterisk version 1.2 and higher, common practice is to assign text labels\\nto priorities. This is to ensure that you can refer to a priority by something other than\\nits number, which probably isn\\'t known, given that dialplans now generally use unnumbered priorities. To assign a text label to a priority, simply add the label inside\\nparentheses after the priority, like this:\\nexten => 123,n(label),application()\\n\\nA very common mistake when writing labels is to insert a comma between the n and the (, like this:\\nexten => 123,n,(label),application() ;<-- THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK\\n\\nThis mistake will break that part of your dialplan, and you will get an\\nerror that the application cannot be found.\\n Asterisk permits simple arithmetic within the priority, such as n+200 or the priority s (for same), but their\\n\\nusage is considered to be an advanced topic. Please note that extension s and priority s are two distinct\\nconcepts.\\n\\nDialplan Syntax | 123\\n\\x0cIn the next chapter, we\\'ll cover how to jump between different priorities based on\\ndialplan logic. You\\'ll be seeing a lot more of priority labels, and you will be using them\\noften in your dialplans.\\n\\nApplications\\nApplications are the workhorses of the dialplan. Each application performs a specific\\naction on the current channel, such as playing a sound, accepting touch-tone input,\\ndialing a channel, hanging up the call, and so forth. In the previous example, you were\\nintroduced to two simple applications: Answer() and Hangup(). You\\'ll learn more about\\nhow these work momentarily.\\nSome applications, such as Answer()and Hangup(), need no other instructions to do their\\njobs. Other applications require additional information. These pieces of information,\\ncalled arguments, can be passed on to the applications to affect how they perform their\\nactions. To pass arguments to an application, place them between the parentheses that\\nfollow the application name, separated by commas.\\nOccasionally, you may also see the pipe character (|) being used as a\\nseparator between arguments, instead of a comma. Feel free to use\\nwhichever you prefer. For the examples in this book, we will be using\\nthe comma to separate arguments to an application, as the authors prefer the look of this syntax. You should be aware, however, that when\\nAsterisk parses the dialplan, it converts any commas in the application\\narguments to pipes.\\n\\nAs we build our first dialplan in the next section, you\\'ll learn to use applications (and\\ntheir associated arguments) to your advantage.\\n\\nA Simple Dialplan\\nNow we\\'re ready to create our first dialplan. We\\'ll start with a very simple example.\\nWe are going to instruct Asterisk to answer a call, play a sound file, and hang up. We\\'ll\\nuse this simple example to point out the most important dialplan fundamentals.\\nFor the examples in this chapter to work correctly, we\\'re assuming that at least one\\nchannel (either Zap, SIP, or IAX2) has been created and configured (as described in the\\nprevious chapter), and that all calls coming into that channel enter the dialplan at the\\n[incoming] context. If you have been creative with any previous examples, you may\\nneed to make adjustments to fit your particular channel names.\\n\\n124 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cThe s Extension\\nBecause of the technology we are using in our channels, we need to cover one more\\nthing before we get started with our dialplan. We need to explain extension s. When\\ncalls enter a context without a specific destination extension (for example, a ringing\\nFXO line), they are passed to the s extension. (The s stands for \"start,\" as this is where\\na call will start if no extension information was passed with the call.)\\nSince this is exactly what we need for our dialplan, let\\'s begin to fill in the pieces. We\\nwill be performing three actions on the call (answer it, play a sound file, and hang it\\nup), so our extension called s will need three priorities. We\\'ll place the three priorities\\nbelow [incoming], because we have decided that all incoming calls should start in this\\ncontext.\\n[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,application()\\nexten => s,n,application()\\nexten => s,n,application()\\n\\nNow all we need to do is fill in the applications, and we\\'ve created our first dialplan.\\nNote that we could have numbered each priority as shown below, but\\nthis is no longer the preferred method, as it makes it harder to make\\nchanges to the dialplan at a later time:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,application()\\nexten => s,2,application()\\nexten => s,3,application()\\n\\nThe Answer(), Playback(), and Hangup() Applications\\nIf we\\'re going to answer the call, play a sound file, and then hang up, we\\'d better learn\\nhow to do just that. The Answer() application is used to answer a channel that is ringing.\\nThis does the initial setup for the channel that receives the incoming call. (A few applications don\\'t require that you answer the channel first, but properly answering the\\nchannel before performing any other actions is a very good habit.) As we mentioned\\nearlier, Answer() takes no arguments.\\nThe Playback() application is used for playing a previously recorded sound file over a\\nchannel. When using the Playback() application, input from the user is simply ignored.\\n\\n There\\n\\nis nothing special about any context name. We could have named this context\\n[stuff_that_comes_in], and as long as that was the context assigned in the channel definition in sip.conf,\\niax.conf, zaptel.conf, et al., the channel would enter the dialplan in that context. Having said that, it is strongly\\nrecommended that you give your contexts names that help you to understand their purpose. Some good\\ncontext names might include [incoming], [local_calls], [long_distance], [sip_telephones], [user_services],\\n[experimental], [remote_locations], and so forth. Always remember that a context determines how a channel\\nenters the dialplan, so name accordingly.\\n\\nA Simple Dialplan | 125\\n\\x0cAsterisk comes with many professionally recorded sound files, which\\nshould be found in the default sounds directory (usually /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/). When you compile Asterisk, you can choose\\nto install various sets of sample sounds that have been recorded in a\\nvariety of languages and file formats. We\\'ll be using these files in many\\nof our examples. Several of the files in our examples come from the Extra\\nSound Package, so please take the time to install it (see Chapter 3). You\\ncan also have your own sound prompts recorded in the same voices as\\nthe stock prompts by visiting http://thevoice.digium.com/.\\n\\nTo use Playback(), specify a filename (without a file extension) as the argument. For\\nexample, Playback(filename) would play the sound file called filename.gsm, assuming\\nit was located in the default sounds directory. Note that you can include the full path\\nto the file if you want, like this:\\nPlayback(/home/john/sounds/filename)\\n\\nThe previous example would play filename.gsm from the /home/john/sounds/ directory.\\nYou can also use relative paths from the Asterisk sounds directory as follows:\\nPlayback(custom/filename)\\n\\nThis example would play filename.gsm from the custom/ subdirectory of the default\\nsounds directory (probably /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/filename.gsm). Note that if\\nthe specified directory contains more than one file with that filename but with different\\nfile extensions, Asterisk automatically plays the best file.\\nThe Hangup() application does exactly as its name implies: it hangs up the active channel. You should use this application at the end of a context when you want to end the\\ncurrent call to ensure that callers don\\'t continue on in the dialplan in a way you might\\nnot have anticipated. The Hangup() application takes no arguments.\\n\\nOur First Dialplan\\nNow that we have designed our extension, let\\'s put together all the pieces to create our\\nfirst dialplan. As is typical in many technology books (especially computer programming books), our first example will be called \"Hello World!\"\\nIn the first priority of our extension, we\\'ll answer the call. In the second, we\\'ll play a\\nsound file named hello-world.gsm, and in the third we\\'ll hang up the call. Here\\'s what\\nthe dialplan looks like:\\n Asterisk selects the best file based on translation costthat is, it selects the file that is the least CPU-intensive\\n\\nto convert to its native audio format. When you start Asterisk, it calculates the translation costs between the\\ndifferent audio formats (they often vary from system to system). You can see these translation costs by typing\\nshow translation at the Asterisk command-line interface. The numbers shown represent how many\\nmilliseconds it takes Asterisk to transcode one second of audio. We\\'ll cover more about the different audio\\nformats (known as codecs) in Chapter 8.\\n\\n126 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Playback(hello-world)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nIf you have a channel or two configured, go ahead and try it out! Simply create a file\\ncalled extensions.conf, (probably in /etc/asterisk) and insert the four lines of dialplan\\ncode we just designed. If it doesn\\'t work, check the Asterisk console for error messages,\\nand make sure your channels are assigned to the [incoming] context.\\nEven though this example is very short and simple, it emphasizes the core concepts of\\ncontexts, extensions, priorities, and applications. If you can get this to work, you have\\nthe fundamental knowledge on which all dialplans are built.\\nLet\\'s build upon our example. After all, a phone system that simply plays a sound file\\nand then hangs up the channel isn\\'t that useful!\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan\\nThe dialplan we just built was static; it will always perform the same actions on every\\ncall. We are going to start adding some logic to our dialplan so that it will perform\\ndifferent actions based on input from the user. To do this, we\\'re going to need to\\nintroduce a few more applications.\\n\\nThe Background(), WaitExten(), and Goto() Applications\\nOne of the most important keys to building interactive Asterisk dialplans is the Back\\nground()# application. Like Playback(), it plays a recorded sound file. Unlike\\nPlayback(), however, when the caller presses a key (or series of keys) on her telephone\\nkeypad, it interrupts the playback and goes to the extension that corresponds with the\\npressed digit(s). If a caller presses 5, for example, Asterisk will stop playing the sound\\nprompt and send control of the call to the first priority of extension 5.\\nThe most common use of the Background() application is to create voice menus (often\\ncalled auto-attendants or phone trees). Many companies use voice menus to direct callers to the proper extensions, thus relieving their receptionists from having to answer\\nevery single call.\\n\\n In fact, if you don\\'t have any channels configured, now is the time to do so. There is a real satisfaction that\\n\\ncomes from passing your first call into an Asterisk system that you built from scratch. People get this funny\\ngrin on their face as they realize that they have just created a telephone system. This pleasure can be yours\\nas well, so please, don\\'t go any further until you have made this little dialplan work.\\n# It should be noted that some people expect that Background(), due to its name, would continue in the dialplan\\n\\nwhile the sound is being played, but its name refers to the fact that it is playing a sound in the background,\\nwhile waiting for DTMF in the foreground.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 127\\n\\x0cBackground() has the same syntax as Playback():\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\n\\nIn earlier versions of Asterisk, if the Background() application finished playing the sound\\nprompt and there were no more priorities in the current extension, Asterisk would sit\\nand wait for input from the caller. Asterisk no longer does this by default. If you want\\nAsterisk to wait for input from the caller after the sound prompt has finished playing,\\nyou can call the WaitExten() application. The WaitExten() application waits for the\\ncaller to enter DTMF digits, and is frequently called directly after the Background()\\napplication, like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\n\\nIf you\\'d like the WaitExten() application to wait a specific number of seconds for a\\nresponse (instead of using the default timeout), simply pass the number of seconds as\\nthe first argument to WaitExten(), like this:\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten(5)\\n\\nBoth Background() and WaitExten() allow the caller to enter DTMF digits. Asterisk then\\nattempts to find an extension in the current context that matches the digits that the\\ncaller entered. If Asterisk finds an unambiguous match, it will send the call to that\\nextension. Let\\'s demonstrate by adding a few lines to our example:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 4,1,Playback(digits/4)\\n\\nIf you call into extension 123 in the example above, it will play a sound prompt that\\nsays \"main menu.\" It will then wait for you to enter either 2, 3, or 4. If you press one\\nof those digits, Asterisk will read that digit back to you. You\\'ll also find that if you enter\\na different digit (such as 5), it won\\'t give you what you expected.\\nIt is also possible that Asterisk will find an ambiguous match. This can be easily explained if we add an extension named 1 to the previous example:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\n\\n128 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 4,1,Playback(digits/4)\\n\\nDial extension 123, and then at the main menu prompt dial 1. Why doesn\\'t Asterisk\\nimmediately read back the number one to you? It\\'s because the digit 1 is ambiguous;\\nAsterisk doesn\\'t know whether you\\'re trying to go to extension 1 or extension 123. It\\nwaits a few seconds to see if you\\'re going to dial another digit (such as the 2 in extension\\n123). If you don\\'t dial any more digits, Asterisk will eventually time out and send the\\ncall to extension 1. (We\\'ll learn how to choose our own timeout values in Chapter 6.)\\nBefore going on, let\\'s review what we\\'ve done so far. When users call into our dialplan,\\nthey will hear a greeting. If they press 1, they will hear the number one, and if they press\\n2, they will hear the number two, and so on. While that\\'s a good start, let\\'s embellish\\nit a little. We\\'ll use the Goto() application to make the dialplan repeat the greeting after\\nplaying back the number.\\nAs its name implies, the Goto() application is used to send the call to another part of\\nthe dialplan. The syntax for the Goto() application requires us to pass the destination\\ncontext, extension, and priority on as arguments to the application, like this:\\nexten => 123,n,Goto(context,extension,priority)\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use the Goto() application in our dialplan:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 1,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 2,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\n\\nThese two new lines (highlighted in bold) will send control of the call back to the 123\\nextension after playing back the selected number.\\nIf you look up the details of the Goto() application, you\\'ll find that you\\ncan actually pass either one, two, or three arguments to the application.\\nIf you pass a single argument, Asterisk will assume it\\'s the destination\\npriority in the current extension. If you pass two arguments, Asterisk\\nwill treat them as the extension and priority to go to in the current\\ncontext.\\nIn this example, we\\'ve passed all three arguments for the sake of clarity,\\nbut passing just the extension and priority would have had the same\\neffect.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 129\\n\\x0cHandling Invalid Entries and Timeouts\\nNow that our first voice menu is starting to come together, let\\'s add some additional\\nspecial extensions. First, we need an extension for invalid entries; when a caller presses\\nan invalid entry (e.g., pressing 9 in the above example), the call is sent to the i extension.\\nSecond, we need an extension to handle situations when the caller doesn\\'t give input\\nin time (the default timeout is 10 seconds). Calls will be sent to the t extension if the\\ncaller takes too long to press a digit after WaitExten() has been called. Here is what our\\ndialplan will look like after we\\'ve added these two extensions:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 1,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 2,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 3,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n\\nUsing the i and t extensions makes our dialplan a little more robust and user-friendly.\\nThat being said, it is still quite limited, because outside callers have no way of connecting to a live person. To do that, we\\'ll need to learn about another application, called\\nDial().\\n\\nUsing the Dial() Application\\nOne of Asterisk\\'s most valuable features is its ability to connect different callers to each\\nother. This is especially useful when callers are using different methods of communication. For example, caller A might be communicating over the traditional analog\\ntelephone network, while user B might be sitting in a caf halfway around the world\\nand speaking on an IP telephone. Luckily, Asterisk takes most of the hard work out of\\nconnecting and translating between disparate networks. All you have to do is learn how\\nto use the Dial() application.\\nThe syntax of the Dial() application is a little more complex than that of the other\\napplications we\\'ve used so far, but don\\'t let that scare you off. Dial() takes up to four\\narguments. The first is the destination you\\'re attempting to call, which (in its simplest\\nform) is made up of a technology (or transport) across which to make the call, a forward\\n\\n130 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cslash, and the remote endpoint or resource. Common technology types include Zap\\n(for analog and T1/E1/J1 channels), SIP, and IAX2. For example, let\\'s assume that we\\nwant to call a Zap endpoint identified by Zap/1, which is an FXS channel with an analog\\nphone plugged into it. The technology is Zap, and the resource is 1. Similarly, a call to\\na SIP device (as defined in sip.conf) might have a destination of SIP/Jane, and a call to\\nan IAX device (defined in iax.conf) might have a destination of IAX2/Fred. If we wanted\\nAsterisk to ring the Zap/1 channel when extension 123 is reached in the dialplan, we\\'d\\nadd the following extension:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\n\\nWe can also dial multiple channels at the same time, by concatenating the destinations\\nwith an ampersand (&), like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1&Zap/2&SIP/Jane)\\n\\nThe Dial() application will ring the specified destinations simultaneously, and bridge\\nthe inbound call with whichever destination channel answers the call first. If the Dial\\n() application can\\'t contact any of the destinations, Asterisk will set a variable called\\nDIALSTATUS with the reason that it couldn\\'t dial the destinations, and continue on with\\nthe next priority in the extension.*\\nThe Dial() application also allows you to connect to a remote VoIP endpoint not previously defined in one of the channel configuration files. The full syntax for this type\\nof connection is:\\nDial(technology/user[:password]@remote_host[:port][/remote_extension])\\n\\nAs an example, you can dial into a demonstration server at Digium using the IAX2\\nprotocol by using the following extension:\\nexten => 500,1,Dial(IAX2/guest@misery.digium.com/s)\\n\\nThe full syntax for the Dial() application is slightly different when dealing with Zap\\nchannels, as shown:\\nDial(Zap/[gGrR]channel_or_group[/remote_extension])\\n\\nFor example, here is how you would dial 1-800-555-1212 on Zap channel number 4.\\nexten => 501,1,Dial(Zap/4/18005551212)\\n\\nThe second argument to the Dial() application is a timeout, specified in seconds. If a\\ntimeout is given, Dial() will attempt to call the destination(s) for that number of seconds before giving up and moving on to the next priority in the extension. If no timeout\\nis specified, Dial() will continue to dial the called channel(s) until someone answers\\nor the caller hangs up. Let\\'s add a timeout of 10 seconds to our extension:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\n\\n* Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll cover variables (in \"Using Variables\") and show you how to have your dialplan make\\n\\ndecisions based on the value of this DIALSTATUS variable.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 131\\n\\x0cIf the call is answered before the timeout, the channels are bridged and the dialplan is\\ndone. If the destination simply does not answer, is busy, or is otherwise unavailable,\\nAsterisk will set a variable called DIALSTATUS and then continue on with the next priority\\nin the extension.\\nLet\\'s put what we\\'ve learned so far into another example:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 123,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 123,n,Hangup()\\n\\nAs you can see, this example will play the vm-nobodyavail.gsm sound file if the call goes\\nunanswered.\\nThe third argument to Dial() is an option string. It may contain one or more characters\\nthat modify the behavior of the Dial() application. While the list of possible options\\nis too long to cover here, one of the most popular options is the m option. If you place\\nthe letter m as the third argument, the calling party will hear hold music instead of\\nringing while the destination channel is being called (assuming, of course, that music\\non hold has been configured correctly). To add the m option to our last example, we\\nsimply change the first line:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10,m)\\nexten => 123,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 123,n,Hangup()\\n\\nSince the extensions numbered 1 and 2 in our dialplan are somewhat useless now that\\nwe know how to use the Dial() application, let\\'s replace them with new extensions\\nthat will allow outside callers to reach John and Jane:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThe fourth and final argument to the Dial() application is a URL. If the destination\\nchannel supports receiving a URL at the time of the call, the specified URL will be sent\\n(for example, if you have an IP telephone that supports receiving a URL, it will appear\\n\\n132 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0con the phone\\'s display; likewise, if you\\'re using a soft phone, the URL might pop up\\non your computer screen). This argument is very rarely used.\\nNote that the second, third, and fourth arguments may be left blank. For example, if\\nyou want to specify an option but not a timeout, simply leave the timeout argument\\nblank, like this:\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,,m)\\n\\nAdding a Context for Internal Calls\\nIn our examples thus far, we have limited ourselves to a single context, but it is probably\\nfair to assume that almost all Asterisk installations will have more than one context in\\ntheir dialplans. As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, one important function of contexts is to separate privileges (such as making long-distance calls or calling\\ncertain extensions) for different classes of callers. In our next example, we\\'ll add to our\\ndialplan by creating two internal phone extensions, and we\\'ll set up the ability for these\\ntwo extensions to call each other. To accomplish this, we\\'ll create a new context called\\n[employees].\\nAs in previous examples, we\\'ve assumed that an FXS analog channel\\n(Zap/1, in this case) has already been configured, and that your\\nzapata.conf file is configured so that any calls originated by Zap/1 begin\\nin the [employees] context. For a few examples at the end of the chapter,\\nwe\\'ll also assume that an FXO Zap channel has been configured as Zap/\\n4, with calls coming in on this channel being sent to the [incoming]\\ncontext.\\nWe\\'ve also assumed you have at least one SIP channel (named SIP/\\nJane) that is configured to originate in the [employees] context. We\\'ve\\ndone this to introduce you to using other types of channels.\\nIf you don\\'t have hardware for the channels listed above (such as Zap/\\n4), or if you\\'re using hardware with different channel names (e.g., not\\nSIP/Jane), just change the examples to match your particular system\\nconfiguration.\\n\\nOur dialplan now looks like this:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 133\\n\\x0cexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\n\\nIn this example, we have added two new extensions to the [employees] context. This\\nway, the person using channel Zap/1 can pick up the phone and dial the person at\\nchannel SIP/Jane by dialing 102. By that same token, the phone registered as SIP/\\nJane can dial Zap/1 by dialing 101.\\nWe\\'ve arbitrarily decided to use extensions 101 and 102 for our examples, but feel free\\nto use whatever numbering convention you wish for your extensions. You should also\\nbe aware that you\\'re not limited to three-digit extensions; you can use as few or as many\\ndigits as you like. (Well, almost. Extensions must be shorter than 80 characters long,\\nand you shouldn\\'t use single-character extensions for your own use, as they\\'re reserved.) Don\\'t forget that you can use names as well, like so:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => john,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\nexten => jane,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\n\\nIt certainly wouldn\\'t hurt to add named extensions if you think your users might be\\ndialed via a VoIP protocol such as SIP that supports dialing by name. You can also see\\n\\n134 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cthat it is possible to have different extensions in the dialplan ring the same endpoint.\\nFor example, you could have extension 200 ring SIP/George, and then have extension\\n201 play a prompt of some kind and then ring SIP/George.\\nNow that our internal callers can call each other, we\\'re well on our way toward having\\na complete dialplan. Next, we\\'ll see how we can make our dialplan more scalable and\\neasier to modify in the future.\\n\\nUsing Variables\\nVariables can be used in an Asterisk dialplan to help reduce typing, add clarity, or add\\nadditional logic to a dialplan. If you have some computer programming experience,\\nyou probably already understand what a variable is. If not, don\\'t worry; we\\'ll explain\\nwhat variables are and how they are used.\\nYou can think of a variable as a container that can hold one value at a time. So, for\\nexample, we might create a variable called JOHN and assign it the value of Zap/1. This\\nway, when we\\'re writing our dialplan, we can refer to John\\'s channel by name, instead\\nof remembering that John is using the channel named Zap/1.\\nThere are two ways to reference a variable. To reference the variable\\'s name, simply\\ntype the name of the variable, such as JOHN. If, on the other hand, you want to reference\\nits value, you must type a dollar sign, an opening curly brace, the name of the variable,\\nand a closing curly brace. Here\\'s how we\\'d reference the variable inside the Dial()\\napplication:\\nexten => 555,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\n\\nIn our dialplan, whenever we write ${JOHN}, Asterisk will automatically replace it with\\nwhatever value has been assigned to the variable named JOHN.\\nNote that variable names are case-sensitive. A variable named JOHN is\\ndifferent than a variable named John. For readability\\'s sake, all the variable names in the examples will be written in uppercase. You should\\nalso be aware that any variables set by Asterisk will be uppercase as well.\\nSome variables, such as CHANNEL or EXTEN are reserved by Asterisk. You\\nshould not attempt to set these variables.\\n\\nThere are three types of variables we can use in our dialplan: global variables, channel\\nvariables, and environment variables. Let\\'s take a moment to look at each type.\\n\\nGlobal variables\\nAs their name implies, global variables apply to all extensions in all contexts. Global\\nvariables are useful in that they can be used anywhere within a dialplan to increase\\nreadability and manageability. Suppose for a moment that you had a large dialplan and\\nseveral hundred references to the Zap/1 channel. Now imagine you had to go through\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 135\\n\\x0cyour dialplan and change all of those references to Zap/2. It would be a long and errorprone process, to say the least.\\nOn the other hand, if you had defined a global variable with the value Zap/1 at the\\nbeginning of your dialplan and then referenced that instead, you would have to change\\nonly one line.\\nGlobal variables should be declared in the [globals] context at the beginning of the\\nextensions.conf file. They can also be defined programmatically, using the GLOBAL()\\ndialplan function. Here is an example of how both methods look inside of a dialplan.\\nThe first shows the setting of a global variable named JOHN with a value of Zap/1. This\\nvariable is set at the time Asterisk parses the dialplan. The second example shows how\\na global variable can be set in the dialplan. In this case, the variable named George is\\nbeing assigned the value of SIP/George when extension 124 is dialed in the [employees]\\ncontext:\\n[globals]\\n[employees]\\nexten => 124,1,Set(GLOBAL(GEORGE)=SIP/George)\\n\\nChannel variables\\nA channel variable is a variable that is associated only with a particular call. Unlike\\nglobal variables, channel variables are defined only for the duration of the current call\\nand are available only to the channels participating in that call.\\nThere are many predefined channel variables available for use within the dialplan,\\nwhich are explained in the channelvariables.txt file in the doc subdirectory of the Asterisk source. Channel variables are set via the Set() application:\\nexten => 125,1,Set(MAGICNUMBER=42)\\n\\nWe\\'ll cover many uses for channel variables in Chapter 6.\\n\\nEnvironment variables\\nEnvironment variables are a way of accessing Unix environment variables from within\\nAsterisk. These are referenced using the ENV() dialplan function. The syntax looks like\\n${ENV(var)}, where var is the Unix environment variable you wish to reference. Environment variables aren\\'t commonly used in Asterisk dialplans, but they are available\\nshould you need them.\\n\\nAdding variables to our dialplan\\nNow that we\\'ve learned about variables, let\\'s put them to work in our dialplan. We\\'ll\\nadd global variables for two people, John and Jane:\\n Don\\'t worry! We\\'ll cover dialplan functions in the \"Dialplan Functions\" section.\\n\\n136 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(${JANE},10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => john,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(${JANE})\\nexten => jane,1,Dial(${JANE})\\n\\nPattern Matching\\nIf we want to be able to allow people to dial through Asterisk and have Asterisk connect\\nthe caller to an outside resource, we need a way to match on any possible phone number\\nthat the caller might dial. Can you imagine how tedious it would be to manually write\\na dialplan with an extension for every possible number you could dial? Luckily, Asterisk\\nhas just the thing for situations like this: pattern matching. Pattern matching allows you\\nto create one extension in your dialplan that matches many different numbers.\\n\\nPattern-matching syntax\\nWhen using pattern matching, certain letters and symbols represent what we are trying\\nto match. Patterns always start with an underscore (_). This tells Asterisk that we\\'re\\nmatching on a pattern, and not on an explicit extension name. (This means, of course,\\nthat you should never start your extension names with an underscore.)\\nIf you forget the underscore on the front of your pattern, Asterisk will\\nthink it\\'s just a named extension and won\\'t do any pattern matching.\\nThis is one of the most common mistakes people make when starting\\nto learn Asterisk.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 137\\n\\x0cAfter the underscore, you can use one or more of the following characters.\\nX\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 0 to 9.\\nZ\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 1 to 9.\\nN\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 2 to 9.\\n\\nMatches a single digit from the range of digits specified. In this case, the pattern\\nmatches a single 1, 5, 6, or 7.\\n. (period)\\nWildcard match; matches one or more characters, no matter what they are.\\nIf you\\'re not careful, wildcard matches can make your dialplans do\\nthings you\\'re not expecting (like matching built-in extensions such\\nas i or h). You should use the wildcard match in a pattern only after\\nyou\\'ve matched as many other digits as possible. For example, the\\nfollowing pattern match should probably never be used:\\n_.\\n\\nIn fact, Asterisk will warn you if you try to use it. Instead, use this\\none, if at all possible:\\n_X.\\n\\n! (bang)\\nWildcard match; matches zero or more characters, no matter what they are.\\nTo use pattern matching in your dialplan, simply put the pattern in the place of the\\nextension name (or number):\\nexten => _NXX,1,Playback(auth-thankyou)\\n\\nIn this example, the pattern matches any three-digit extension from 200 through 999\\n(the N matches any digit between 2 and 9, and each X matches a digit between 0 and 9).\\nThat is to say, if a caller dialed any three-digit extension between 200 and 999 in this\\ncontext, he would hear the sound file auth-thankyou.gsm.\\nOne other important thing to know about pattern matching is that if Asterisk finds\\nmore than one pattern that matches the dialed extension, it will use the most specific\\none (going from left to right). Say you had defined the following two patterns, and a\\ncaller dialed 555-1212:\\nexten => _555XXXX,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => _55512XX,1,Playback(digits/2)\\n\\nIn this case the second extension would be selected, because it is more specific.\\n\\n138 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cPattern-matching examples\\nBefore we go on, let\\'s look at a few more pattern-matching examples. In each one, see\\nif you can tell what the pattern would match before reading the explanation. We\\'ll start\\nwith an easy one:\\n_NXXXXXX\\n\\nThis pattern would match any seven-digit number, as long as the first digit was two or\\nhigher. This pattern would be compatible with any North American Numbering Plan\\nlocal seven-digit number. In areas with 10-digit dialing, that pattern would look like\\nthis:\\n_NXXNXXXXXX\\n\\nNote that neither of these two patterns would handle long distance calls. We\\'ll cover\\nthose shortly.\\n\\nThe NANP and Toll Fraud\\nThe North American Number Plan (NANP) is a shared telephone numbering scheme\\nused by 19 countries in North America and the Caribbean. Countries within NANP\\nshare country code 1.\\nIn the United States and Canada, telecom regulations are similar (and sensible) enough\\nthat you can place a long-distance call to most numbers in country code 1 and expect\\nto pay a reasonable toll. What many people don\\'t realize, however, is that 19 countries,\\nmany of which have very different telecom regulations, share the NANP. (More information can be found at http://www.nanpa.com.)\\nOne popular scam using the NANP tries to trick naive North Americans into calling\\nexpensive per-minute toll numbers in a Caribbean country; the callers believe that since\\nthey dialed 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX to reach the number, they\\'ll be paying their standard\\nnational long-distance rate for the call. Since the country in question may have regulations that allow for this form of extortion, the caller is ultimately held responsible for\\nthe call charges.\\nThe only way to prevent this sort of activity is to block calls to certain area codes (809,\\nfor example) and remove the restrictions only on an as-needed basis.\\n\\nLet\\'s try another:\\n\\nThis one is slightly more difficult. This would match the number 1, followed by an area\\ncode between 200 and 999, then any 7-digit number. In the NANP calling area, you\\nwould use this pattern to match any long-distance number.\\nNow for an even trickier example:\\n_011.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 139\\n\\x0cIf that one left you scratching your head, look at it again. Did you notice the period on\\nthe end? This pattern matches any number that starts with 011 and has at least one\\nmore digit. In the NANP, this indicates an international phone number. (We\\'ll be using\\nthese patterns in the next section to add outbound dialing capabilities to our dialplan.)\\n\\nUsing the ${EXTEN} channel variable\\nWe know what you\\'re thinking... You\\'re sitting there asking yourself, \"So what happens\\nif I want to use pattern matching, but I need to know which digits were actually dialed?\"\\nLuckily, Asterisk has just the answer. Whenever you dial an extension, Asterisk sets\\nthe ${EXTEN} channel variable to the digits that were dialed. We can use an application\\ncalled SayDigits() to test it out:\\nexten => _XXX,1,SayDigits(${EXTEN})\\n\\nIn this example, the SayDigits() application will read back to you the three-digit extension you dialed.\\nOften, it\\'s useful to manipulate the ${EXTEN} by stripping a certain number of digits off\\nthe front of the extension. This is accomplished by using the syntax ${EXTEN:x}, where\\nx is where you want the returned string to start, from left to right. For example, if the\\nvalue of EXTEN is 95551212, ${EXTEN:1} equals 5551212. Let\\'s take a look at another\\nexample:\\nexten => _XXX,1,SayDigits(${EXTEN:1})\\n\\nIn this example, the SayDigits() application would start at the second digit, and thus\\nread back only the last two digits of the dialed extension.\\n\\nMore Advanced Digit Manipulation\\nThe ${EXTEN} variable properly has the syntax ${EXTEN:x:y}, where x is the starting\\nposition, and y is the number of digits to return. Given the following dial string:\\n\\nwe can extract the following digit strings using the ${EXTEN:x:y} construct:\\n${EXTEN:1:3} would contain 416.\\n${EXTEN:4:7} would contain 9671111.\\n${EXTEN:-4:4} would start four digits from the end, and return four digits, giving us\\n\\n1111.\\n If you grew up in North America, you may believe that the 1 you dial before a long distance call is \"the long\\n\\ndistance code.\" This is incorrect. The number 1 is in fact the international country code for all countries in\\nNANP. Keep this in mind if you ever send your phone number to someone in another country. They may\\nnot know what your country code is, and thus be unable to call you with just your area code and phone\\nnumber. Your full phone number with country code should be printed as +1 NPA NXX XXXX (where NPA\\nis your area code)e.g., +1 416 555 1212.\\n\\n140 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c${EXTEN:1} would give us everything after the first digit, 4169671111 (if the number of\\n\\ndigits to return is left blank, it will return the entire remaining string).\\nThis is a very powerful construct, but most of these variations are not very common in\\nnormal use. For the most part, you will be using ${EXTEN:1} to strip off your external\\naccess code.\\n\\nEnabling Outbound Dialing\\nNow that we\\'ve introduced pattern matching, we can go about the process of allowing\\nusers to make outbound calls. The first thing we\\'ll do is add a variable to the\\n[globals] context to define which channel will be used for outbound calls:\\n[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n\\nNext, we will add contexts to our dialplan for outbound dialing.\\nYou may be asking yourself at this point, \"Why do we need separate contexts for outbound calls?\" This is so that we can regulate and control which callers have permission\\nto make outbound calls, and which types of outbound calls they are allowed to make.\\nTo begin, let\\'s create a context for local calls. To be consistent with most traditional\\nphone switches, we\\'ll put a 9 on the front of our patterns, so that users have to dial 9\\nbefore calling an outside number:\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNote that dialing 9 doesn\\'t actually give you an outside line, unlike with\\nmany traditional PBX systems. Once you dial 9 on an analog line, the\\ndial tone will stop. If you\\'d like the dial tone to continue even after\\ndialing 9, add the following line (right after your context definition):\\nignorepat => 9\\n\\nThis directive tells Asterisk to continue to provide a dial tone on an\\nanalog line, even after the caller has dialed the indicated pattern. This\\nwill not work with VoIP telephones, as they usually don\\'t send digits to\\nthe system as they are input; they are sent to Asterisk all at once. Luckily,\\nmost of the popular VoIP telephones can be configured to emulate the\\nsame functionality.\\n\\nLet\\'s review what we\\'ve just done. We\\'ve added a global variable called OUTBOUND\\nTRUNK, which simply defines the channel we are using for outbound calls. We\\'ve also\\nadded a context for local outbound calls. In priority 1, we take the dialed extension,\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 141\\n\\x0cstrip off the 9 with the ${EXTEN:1} syntax, and then attempt to dial that number on the\\nchannel signified by the variable OUTBOUNDTRUNK. If the call is successful, the caller is\\nbridged with the outbound channel. If the call is unsuccessful (because either the channel is busy or the number can\\'t be dialed for some reason), the Congestion() application\\nis called, which plays a \"fast busy signal\" (congestion tone) to let the caller know that\\nthe call was unsuccessful.\\nBefore we go any further, let\\'s make sure our dialplan allows outbound emergency\\nnumbers:\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\nexten => 9911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911) ; So that folks who dial \"9\"\\n; first will also get through\\n\\nAgain, we\\'re assuming for the sake of these examples that we\\'re inside the United States\\nor Canada. If you\\'re outside of this area, please replace 911 with the emergency services\\nnumber in your particular location. This is something you never want to forget to put\\nin your dialplan!\\nNext, let\\'s add a context for long-distance calls:\\n[outbound-long-distance]\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Playtones(congestion)\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNow that we have these two new contexts, how do we allow internal users to take\\nadvantage of them? We need a way for contexts to be able to use the functionality\\ncontained in other contexts.\\n\\nIncludes\\nAsterisk has a feature that enables us to use the extensions from one context within\\nanother context via the include directive. This is used to control access to different\\nsections of the dialplan. We\\'ll use the include functionality to allow users in our\\n[employees] context the ability to make outbound phone calls. But first, let\\'s cover the\\nsyntax.\\nThe include statement takes the following form, where context is the name of the\\nremote context we want to include in the current context:\\ninclude => context\\n\\n The advantage of this is that if one day we decide to send all of our calls through some other channel, we\\n\\nhave to edit the channel name assigned to the variable OUTBOUNDTRUNK only in the [globals] context, instead\\nof having to manually edit every reference to the channel in our dialplan.\\n\\n142 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cWhen we include other contexts within our current context, we have to be mindful of\\nthe order in which we are including them. Asterisk will first try to match the dialed\\nextension in the current context. If unsuccessful, it will then try the first included context (including any contexts included in that context), and then continue to the other\\nincluded contexts in the order in which they were included.\\nAs it sits, our current dialplan has two contexts for outbound calls, but there\\'s no way\\nfor people in the [employees] context to use them. Let\\'s remedy that by including the\\ntwo outbound contexts in the [employees] context, like this:\\n[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(${JANE},10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\ninclude => outbound-local\\ninclude => outbound-long-distance\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\nexten => 9911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\n[outbound-long-distance]\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 143\\n\\x0cexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Playtones(congestion)\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThese two include statements make it possible for callers in the [employees] context\\nto make outbound calls. We should also note that for security\\'s sake you should always\\nmake sure that your [inbound] context never allows outbound dialing. (If by chance it\\ndid, people could dial into your system and then make outbound toll calls that would\\nbe charged to you!)\\n\\nConclusion\\nAnd there you have it--a basic but functional dialplan. It\\'s not exactly fully featured,\\nbut we\\'ve covered all of the fundamentals. In the following chapters, we\\'ll continue to\\nadd features to this foundation.\\nIf parts of this dialplan don\\'t make sense, you may want to go back and re-read a section\\nor two before continuing on to the next chapter. It\\'s imperative that you understand\\nthese principles and how to apply them, as the next chapters build on this information.\\n\\n144 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c\\nMore Dialplan Concepts\\n\\nFor a list of all the ways technology has failed to improve\\nthe quality of life, please press three.\\n--Alice Kahn\\n\\nAlrighty. You\\'ve got the basics of dialplans down, but you know there\\'s more to come.\\nIf you don\\'t have the last chapter sorted out yet, please go back and give it another read.\\nWe\\'re about to get into more advanced topics.\\n\\nExpressions and Variable Manipulation\\nAs we begin our dive into the deeper aspects of dialplans, it is time to introduce you to\\na few tools that will greatly add to the power you can exercise in your dialplan. These\\nconstructs add incredible intelligence to your dialplan by enabling it to make decisions\\nbased on different criteria you want to define. Put on your thinking cap, and let\\'s get\\nstarted.\\n\\nBasic Expressions\\nExpressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that you string together to produce a result. An expression can test values, alter strings, or perform\\nmathematical calculations. Let\\'s say we have a variable called COUNT. In plain English,\\ntwo expressions using that variable might be \"COUNT plus 1\" and \"COUNT divided by 2.\"\\nEach of these expressions has a particular result or value, depending on the value of\\nthe given variable.\\nIn Asterisk, expressions always begin with a dollar sign and an opening square bracket\\nand end with a closing square bracket, as shown here:\\n$[expression]\\n\\nThus, we would write the above two examples like this:\\n$[${COUNT} + 1]\\n$[${COUNT} / 2]\\n\\n\\x0cWhen Asterisk encounters an expression in a dialplan, it replaces the entire expression\\nwith the resulting value. It is important to note that this takes place after variable substitution. To demonstrate, let\\'s look at the following code:*\\nexten => 321,1,Set(COUNT=3)\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=$[${COUNT} + 1])\\nexten => 321,n,SayNumber(${NEWCOUNT})\\n\\nIn the first priority, we assign the value of 3 to the variable named COUNT.\\nIn the second priority, only one application--Set()--is involved, but three things actually happen:\\n1. Asterisk substitutes ${COUNT} with the number 3 in the expression. The expression\\neffectively becomes this:\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=$[3 + 1])\\n\\n2. Asterisk evaluates the expression, adding 1 to 3, and replaces it with its computed\\nvalue of 4:\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=4)\\n\\n3. The value 4 is assigned to the NEWCOUNT variable by the Set() application.\\nThe third priority simply invokes the SayNumber() application, which speaks the current\\nvalue of the variable ${NEWCOUNT} (set to the value 4 in priority two).\\nTry it out in your own dialplan.\\n\\nOperators\\nWhen you create an Asterisk dialplan, you\\'re really writing code in a specialized scripting language. This means that the Asterisk dialplan--like any programming language\\n--recognizes symbols called operators that allow you to manipulate variables. Let\\'s\\nlook at the types of operators that are available in Asterisk:\\nBoolean operators\\nThese operators evaluate the \"truth\" of a statement. In computing terms, that essentially refers to whether the statement is something or nothing (nonzero or zero,\\ntrue or false, on or off, and so on). The Boolean operators are:\\n\\nThis operator (called the \"or\" operator, or \"pipe\") returns the evaluation of\\nexpr1 if it is true (neither an empty string nor zero). Otherwise, it returns the\\nevaluation of expr2.\\n\\n* Remember that when you reference a variable you can call it by its name, but when you refer to a variable\\'s\\n\\nvalue, you have to use the dollar sign and brackets around the variable name.\\n\\n146 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0c\\nThis operator (called \"and\") returns the evaluation of expr1 if both expressions\\nare true (i.e., neither expression evaluates to an empty string or zero). Otherwise, it returns zero.\\nexpr1 {=, >, >=, <, <=, !=} expr2\\n\\nThese operators return the results of an integer comparison if both arguments\\nare integers; otherwise, they return the results of a string comparison. The\\nresult of each comparison is 1 if the specified relation is true, or 0 if the relation\\nis false. (If you are doing string comparisons, they will be done in a manner\\nthat\\'s consistent with the current local settings of your operating system.)\\nMathematical operators\\nWant to perform a calculation? You\\'ll want one of these:\\n\\nThese operators return the results of the addition or subtraction of integervalued arguments.\\nexpr1 {*, /, %} expr2\\n\\nThese return, respectively, the results of the multiplication, integer division,\\nor remainder of integer-valued arguments.\\nRegular expression operator\\nYou can also use the regular expression operator in Asterisk:\\n\\nThis operator matches expr1 against expr2, where expr2 must be a regular\\nexpression. The regular expression is anchored to the beginning of the string\\nwith an implicit ^.\\nIf the match succeeds and the pattern contains at least one regular expression\\nsubexpression--\\\\( ... \\\\)--the string corresponding to \\\\1 is returned; otherwise, the matching operator returns the number of characters matched. If the\\nmatch fails and the pattern contains a regular expression subexpression, the\\nnull string is returned; otherwise, 0 is returned.\\nIn Asterisk version 1.0 the parser was quite simple, so it required that you put at least\\none space between the operator and any other values. Consequently, the following\\nmight not have worked as expected:\\nexten => 123,1,Set(TEST=$[2+1])\\n\\n For more on regular expressions, grab a copy of the ultimate reference, Jeffrey E.F. Friedl\\'s\\n\\nMastering Regular Expressions (O\\'Reilly) or visit http://www.regular-expressions.info.\\n If you don\\'t know what a ^ has to do with regular expressions, you simply must obtain a copy of\\n\\nMastering Regular Expressions. It will change your life!\\n\\nExpressions and Variable Manipulation | 147\\n\\x0cThis would have assigned the variable TEST to the string \"2+1\", instead of the value 3.\\nIn order to remedy that, we would put spaces around the operator like so:\\nexten => 234,1,Set(TEST=$[2 + 1])\\n\\nThis is no longer necessary in Asterisk 1.2 or 1.4 as the expression parser has been made\\nmore forgiving in these types of scenarios, however, for readability\\'s sake, we still recommend the spaces around your operators.\\nTo concatenate text onto the beginning or end of a variable, simply place them together\\nin an expression, like this:\\nexten => 234,1,Set(NEWTEST=$[blah${TEST}])\\n\\nDialplan Functions\\nDialplan functions allow you to add more power to your expressions; you can think of\\nthem as intelligent variables. Dialplan functions allow you to calculate string lengths,\\ndates and times, MD5 checksums, and so on, all from within a dialplan expression.\\n\\nSyntax\\nDialplan functions have the following basic syntax:\\nFUNCTION_NAME(argument)\\n\\nMuch like variables, you reference a function\\'s name as above, but you reference a\\nfunction\\'s value with the addition of a dollar sign, an opening curly brace, and a closing\\ncurly brace:\\n${FUNCTION_NAME(argument)}\\n\\nFunctions can also encapsulate other functions, like so:\\n${FUNCTION_NAME(${FUNCTION_NAME(argument)})}\\n^\\n^ ^\\n^\\n^^^^\\n\\nAs you\\'ve probably already figured out, you must be very careful about making sure\\nyou have matching parentheses and braces. In the above example, we have labeled the\\nopening parentheses and curly braces with numbers and their corresponding closing\\ncounterparts with the same numbers.\\n\\nExamples of Dialplan Functions\\nFunctions are often used in conjunction with the Set() application to either get or set\\nthe value of a variable. As a simple example, let\\'s look at the LEN() function. This\\nfunction calculates the string length of its argument. Let\\'s calculate the string length of\\na variable and read back the length to the caller:\\n\\n148 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 123,1,Set(TEST=example)\\nexten => 123,n,SayNumber(${LEN(${TEST})})\\n\\nThe above example would evaluate the string example as having seven characters, assign\\nthe number of characters to the variable length, and then speak the number to the user\\nwith the SayNumber() application.\\nLet\\'s look at another simple example. If we wanted to set one of the various channel\\ntimeouts, we could use the TIMEOUT() function. The TIMEOUT() function accepts one of\\nthree arguments: absolute, digit, and response. To set the digit timeout with the\\nTIMEOUT() function, we could use the Set() application, like so:\\nexten => s,1,Set(TIMEOUT(digit)=30)\\n\\nNotice the lack of ${ } surrounding the function. Just as if we were assigning a value\\nto a variable, we assign a value to a function without the use of the ${ } encapsulation.\\nA complete list of available functions can be found by typing core show functions at\\nthe Asterisk command-line interface. You can also look them up in Appendix F.\\n\\nConditional Branching\\nNow that you\\'ve learned a bit about expressions and functions, it\\'s time to put them\\nto use. By using expressions and functions, you can add even more advanced logic to\\nyour dialplan. To allow your dialplan to make decisions, you\\'ll use\\nconditional branching. Let\\'s take a closer look.\\n\\nThe GotoIf() Application\\nThe key to conditional branching is the GotoIf() application. GotoIf() evaluates an\\nexpression and sends the caller to a specific destination based on whether the expression evaluates to true or false.\\nGotoIf() uses a special syntax, often called the conditional syntax:\\n\\nIf the expression evaluates to true, the caller is sent to destination1. If the expression\\nevaluates to false, the caller is sent to the second destination. So, what is true and what\\nis false? An empty string and the number 0 evaluate as false. Anything else evaluates as\\ntrue.\\nThe destinations can each be one of the following:\\n A priority label within the same extension, such as weasels\\n An extension and a priority label within the same context, such as 123,weasels\\n A context, extension, and priority label, such as incoming,123,weasels\\n\\nConditional Branching | 149\\n\\x0cEither of the destinations may be omitted, but not both. If the omitted destination is\\nto be followed, Asterisk simply goes on to the next priority in the current extension.\\nLet\\'s use GotoIf() in an example:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nYou will notice that we have used the Hangup() application following\\neach Playback() application. This is done so that when we jump to the\\nweasels label, the call stops before execution gets to the officeiguanas sound file. It is becoming increasingly common to see extensions broken up in to multiple components (protected from each other\\nby the Hangup() command), each one acting as steps executed following\\na GotoIf().\\n\\nProviding Only a False Conditional Path\\nIf we wanted to, we could have crafted the preceding example like this:\\nexten\\nexten\\n; but\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=> 345,n,GotoIf($[${TEST} = 1]?:iguanas) ; we don\\'t have the weasels label anymore,\\nthis will still work\\n\\nThere is nothing between the ? and the :, so if the statement evaluates to true, execution\\nof the dialplan will continue at the next step. Since that is what we want, a label is not\\nneeded.\\nWe don\\'t really recommend doing this, because this is hard to read, but you will see\\ndialplans like this, so it\\'s good to be aware that this syntax is totally correct.\\n\\nTypically when you have this type of layout where you end up wanting to limit Asterisk\\nfrom falling through to the next priority after you\\'ve performed that jump, it\\'s probably\\nbetter to jump to separate extensions instead of priority labels. If anything, it makes it\\na bit more clear when reading the dialplan. We could rewrite the previous bit of dialplan\\nlike this:\\nexten => 345,1,Set(TEST=1)\\nexten => 345,n,GotoIf($[${TEST} = 1]?weasels,1:iguanas,1); now we\\'re going to\\n; extension,priority\\nexten => weasels,1,Playback(weasels-eaten-phonesys); this is NOT a label.\\n; It is a different extension\\nexten => weasels,n,Hangup()\\n\\n150 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => iguanas,1,Playback(office-iguanas)\\nexten => iguanas,n,Hangup()\\n\\nBy changing the value assigned to TEST in the first line, you should be able to have your\\nAsterisk server play a different greeting.\\nLet\\'s look at another example of conditional branching. This time, we\\'ll use both\\nGoto() and GotoIf() to count down from 10 and then hang up:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s analyze this example. In the first priority, we set the variable COUNT to 10. Next,\\nwe check to see if COUNT is greater than 0. If it is, we move on to the next priority. (Don\\'t\\nforget that if we omit a destination in the GotoIf() application, control goes to the next\\npriority.) From there we speak the number, subtract 1 from COUNT, and go back to\\npriority label start. If COUNT is less than or equal to 0, control goes to priority label\\ngoodbye, and the call is hung up.\\nThe classic example of conditional branching is affectionately known as the anti-girlfriend logic. If the Caller ID number of the incoming call matches the phone number\\nof the recipient\\'s ex-girlfriend, Asterisk gives a different message than it ordinarily\\nwould to any other caller. While somewhat simple and primitive, it\\'s a good example\\nfor learning about conditional branching within the Asterisk dialplan.\\nThis example uses the CALLERID function, which allows us to retrieve the Caller ID\\ninformation on the inbound call. Let\\'s assume for the sake of this example that the\\nvictim\\'s phone number is 888-555-1212:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nIn priority 1, we call the GotoIf() application. It tells Asterisk to go to priority label\\nreject if the Caller ID number matches 8885551212, and otherwise to go to priority label\\nallow (we could have simply omitted the label name, causing the GotoIf() to fall\\nthrough). If the Caller ID number matches, control of the call goes to priority label\\nreject, which plays back an uninspiring message to the undesired caller. Otherwise,\\nthe call attempts to dial the recipient on channel Zap/4.\\n\\nTime-Based Conditional Branching with GotoIfTime()\\nAnother way to use conditional branching in your dialplan is with the GotoIfTime()\\napplication. Whereas GotoIf() evaluates an expression to decide what to do, GotoIf\\nConditional Branching | 151\\n\\x0cTime() looks at the current system time and uses that to decide whether or not to follow\\n\\na different branch in the dialplan.\\nThe most obvious use of this application is to give your callers a different greeting before\\nand after normal business hours.\\nThe syntax for the GotoIfTime() application looks like this:\\nGotoIfTime(times,days_of_week,days_of_month,months?label)\\n\\nIn short, GotoIfTime() sends the call to the specified label if the current date and time\\nmatch the criteria specified by times, days_of_week, days_of_month, and months. Let\\'s\\nlook at each argument in more detail:\\ntimes\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more time ranges, in a 24-hour format. As an example, 9:00\\nA.M. through 5:00 P.M. would be specified as 09:00-17:00. The day starts at 0:00\\nand ends at 23:59.\\nIt is worth noting that times will properly wrap around. So if you\\nwish to specify the times your office is closed, you might write\\n18:00-9:00 in the times parameter, and it will perform as expected.\\nNote that this technique works as well for the other components\\nof GotoIfTime. For example, you can write sat-sun to specify the\\nweekend days.\\n\\ndays_of_week\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more days of the week. The days should be specified as mon,\\ntue, wed, thu, fri, sat, and/or sun. Monday through Friday would be expressed as\\nmon-fri. Tuesday and Thursday would be expressed as tue&thu.\\nNote that you can specify a combination of ranges and single days,\\nas in: sun-mon&wed&fri-sat, or, more simply: wed&fri-mon.\\n\\ndays_of_month\\n\\nThis is a list of the numerical days of the month. Days are specified by the numbers\\n1 through 31. The 7th through the 12th would be expressed as 7-12, and the 15th\\nand 30th of the month would be written as 15&30.\\nmonths\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more months of the year. The months should be written as\\njan-apr for a range, and separated with ampersands when wanting to include nonsequencial months, such as jan&mar&jun. You can also combine them like so:\\njan-apr&jun&oct-dec.\\n\\n152 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cIf you wish to match on all possible values for any of these arguments, simply put an\\n* in for that argument.\\nThe label argument can be any of the following:\\n A priority label within the same extension, such as time_has_passed\\n An extension and a priority within the same context, such as 123,time_has_passed\\n A context, extension, and priority, such as incoming,123,time_has_passed\\nNow that we\\'ve covered the syntax, let\\'s look at a couple of examples. The following\\nexample would match from 9:00 A.M. to 5:59 P.M., on Monday through Friday, on\\nany day of the month, in any month of the year:\\nexten => s,1,GotoIfTime(09:00-17:59,mon-fri,*,*?open,s,1)\\n\\nIf the caller calls during these hours, the call will be sent to the first priority of the s\\nextension in the context named open. If the call is made outside of the specified times,\\nit will be sent to the next priority of the current extension. This allows you to easily\\nbranch on multiple times, as shown in the next example (note that you should always\\nput your most specific time matches before the least specific ones):\\n; If it\\'s any hour of the day, on any day of the week,\\n; during the fourth day of the month, in the month of July,\\n; we\\'re closed\\nexten => s,1,GotoIfTime(*,*,4,jul?open,s,1)\\n; During business hours, send calls to the open context\\nexten => s,n,GotoIfTime(09:00-17:59|mon-fri|*|*?open,s,1)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIfTime(09:00-11:59|sat|*|*?open,s,1)\\n; Otherwise, we\\'re closed\\nexten => s,n,Goto(closed,s,1)\\n\\nIf you run into the situation where you ask the question, \"But I specified\\n17:58 and it\\'s now 17:59. Why is it still doing the same thing?\" it should\\nbe noted that the granularity of the GotoIfTime() application is only to\\na two-minute period. So if you specify 18:00 as the ending time of a\\nperiod, the system will continue to perform the same way for an additional minute, until 18:01:59.\\n\\nVoicemail\\nOne of the most popular (or, arguably, unpopular) features of any modern telephone\\nsystem is voicemail. Naturally, Asterisk has a reasonably flexible voicemail system.\\nSome of the features of Asterisk\\'s voicemail system include:\\n Unlimited password-protected voicemail boxes, each containing mailbox folders\\nfor organizing voicemail\\n Different greetings for busy and unavailable states\\nVoicemail | 153\\n\\x0c Default and custom greetings\\n The ability to associate phones with more than one mailbox and mailboxes with\\nmore than one phone\\n Email notification of voicemail, with the voicemail optionally attached as a sound\\nfile\\n Voicemail forwarding and broadcasts\\n Message-waiting indicator (flashing light or stuttered dial tone) on many types of\\nphones\\n Company directory of employees, based on voicemail boxes\\nAnd that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg! In this section, we\\'ll introduce you to the fundamentals of a typical voicemail setup.\\nThe voicemail configuration is defined in the configuration file called voicemail.conf.\\nThis file contains an assortment of settings that you can use to customize the voicemail\\nsystem to your needs. Covering all of the available options in voicemail.conf would be\\nbeyond the scope of this chapter, but the sample configuration file is well documented\\nand quite easy to follow. For now, look near the bottom of the file, where voicemail\\ncontexts and voicemail boxes are defined.\\nJust as dialplan contexts keep different parts of your dialplan separate, voicemail contexts allow you to define different sets of mailboxes that are separate from one another.\\nThis allows you to host voicemail for several different companies or offices on the same\\nserver. Voicemail contexts are defined in the same way as dialplan contexts, with square\\nbrackets surrounding the name of the context. For our examples, we\\'ll be using the\\n[default] voicemail context.\\n\\nCreating Mailboxes\\nInside each voicemail context, we define different mailboxes. The syntax for defining\\na mailbox is:\\nmailbox => password,name[,email[,pager_email[,options]]]\\n\\nLet\\'s explain what each part of the mailbox definition does:\\nmailbox\\n\\nThis is the mailbox number. It usually corresponds with the extension number of\\nthe associated set.\\npassword\\n\\nThis is the numeric password that the mailbox owner will use to access her voicemail. If the user changes her password, the system will update this field in the\\nvoicemail.conf file.\\n\\n No, you really don\\'t have to pay for this--and yes, it really does work.\\n\\n154 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cname\\n\\nThis is the name of the mailbox owner. The company directory uses the text in this\\nfield to allow callers to spell usernames.\\nemail\\n\\nThis is the email address of the mailbox owner. Asterisk can send voicemail notifications (including the voicemail message itself) to the specified email box.\\npager_email\\n\\nThis is the email address of the mailbox owner\\'s pager or cell phone. Asterisk can\\nsend a short voicemail notification message to the specified email address.\\noptions\\n\\nThis field is a list of options that sets the mailbox owner\\'s time zone and overrides\\nthe global voicemail settings. There are nine valid options: attach, serveremail, tz,\\nsaycid, review, operator, callback, dialout, and exitcontext. These options\\nshould be in option = value pairs, separated by the pipe character (|). The tz option sets the user\\'s time zone to a time zone previously defined in the [zonemes\\nsages] section of voicemail.conf, and the other eight options override the global\\nvoicemail settings with the same names.\\nA typical mailbox definition might look something like this:\\ntz=central|attach=yes\\n\\nContinuing with our dialplan from the last chapter, let\\'s set up voicemail boxes for\\nJohn and Jane. We\\'ll give John a password of 1234 and Jane a password of 4444 (remember, these go in voicemail.conf, not in extensions.conf):\\n[default]\\n\\nAdding Voicemail to the Dialplan\\nNow that we\\'ve created mailboxes for Jane and John, let\\'s allow callers to leave messages for them if they don\\'t answer the phone. To do this, we\\'ll use the VoiceMail()\\napplication.\\nThe VoiceMail() application sends the caller to the specified mailbox, so that he can\\nleave a message. The mailbox should be specified as mailbox @ context, where context is the name of the voicemail context. The option letters b or u can be added to\\nrequest the type of greeting. If the letter b is used, the caller will hear the mailbox owner\\'s\\nbusy message. If the letter u is used, the caller will hear the mailbox owner\\'s\\nunavailable message (if one exists).\\nLet\\'s use this in our sample dialplan. Previously, we had a line like this in our\\n[internal] context, which allowed us to call John:\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\n\\nVoicemail | 155\\n\\x0cNext, let\\'s add an unavailable message that the caller will be played if John doesn\\'t\\nanswer the phone within 10 seconds. Remember, the second argument to the Dial()\\napplication is a timeout. If the call is not answered before the timeout expires, the call\\nis sent to the next priority. Let\\'s add a 10-second timeout, and a priority to send the\\ncaller to voicemail if John doesn\\'t answer in time:\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 101,n,VoiceMail(101@default,u)\\n\\nNow, let\\'s change it so that if John is busy (on another call), it\\'ll send us to his voicemail,\\nwhere we\\'ll hear his busy message. To do this, we will make use of the ${DIALSTATUS}\\nvariable which contains one of several status values (see core show application dial\\nat the Asterisk console for a listing of all the possible values):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n101,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\n\\nNow callers will get John\\'s voicemail (with the appropriate greeting) if John is either\\nbusy or unavailable. A slight problem remains, however, in that John has no way of\\nretrieving his messages. Let\\'s remedy that.\\n\\nAccessing Voicemail\\nUsers can retrieve their voicemail messages, change their voicemail options, and record\\ntheir voicemail greetings by using the VoiceMailMain() application. In its typical form,\\nVoiceMailMain() is called without any arguments. Let\\'s add extension 700 to the\\n[internal] context of our dialplan so that internal users can dial it to access their voicemail messages:\\nexten => 700,1,VoiceMailMain()\\n\\nCreating a Dial-by-Name Directory\\nOne last feature of the Asterisk voicemail system we should cover is the dial-by-name\\ndirectory. This is created with the Directory() application. This application uses the\\nnames defined in the mailboxes in voicemail.conf to present the caller with a dial-byname directory of the users.\\nDirectory() takes up to three arguments: the voicemail context from which to read the\\n\\nnames, the optional dialplan context in which to dial the user, and an option string\\n(which is also optional). By default, Directory() searches for the user by last name, but\\npassing the f option forces it to search by first name instead. Let\\'s add two dial-byname directories to the [incoming] context of our sample dialplan, so that callers can\\nsearch by either first or last name:\\n\\n156 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 8,1,Directory(default,incoming,f)\\nexten => 9,1,Directory(default,incoming)\\n\\nIf callers press 8, they\\'ll get a directory by first name. If they dial 9, they\\'ll get the\\ndirectory by last name.\\n\\nMacros\\nMacros are a very useful construct designed to avoid repetition in the dialplan. They\\nalso help in making changes to the dialplan. To illustrate this point, let\\'s look at our\\nsample dialplan again. If you remember the changes we made for voicemail, we ended\\nup with the following for John\\'s extension:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n101,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\n\\nNow imagine you have a hundred users on your Asterisk system--setting up the extensions would involve a lot of copying and pasting. Then imagine that you need to\\nmake a change to the way your extensions work. That would involve a lot of editing,\\nand you\\'d be almost certain to have errors.\\nInstead, you can define a macro that contains a list of steps to take, and then have all\\nof the phone extensions refer to that macro. All you need to change is the macro, and\\neverything in the dialplan that references that macro will change as well.\\nIf you\\'re familiar with computer programming, you\\'ll recognize that\\nmacros are similar to subroutines in many modern programming languages. If you\\'re not familiar with computer programming, don\\'t worry\\n--we\\'ll walk you through creating a macro.\\n\\nThe best way to appreciate macros is to see one in action, so let\\'s move right along.\\n\\n Although Macro seems like a general-purpose dialplan subroutine, it has a stack overflow problem that means\\n\\nyou should not try to nest Macro calls more than five levels deep. As of this writing, we do not know whether\\nthe Macro application will be patched for 1.4, or if it will be rewritten for future versions. If you plan to do a\\nlot of macros within macros (and call complex functions within them), you may run into stability problems.\\nYou will know you have a problem with just one test call, so if your dialplan tests out, you\\'re good to go. We\\nalso recommend that you take a look at the Gosub and Return applications, as a lot of macro functionality can\\nbe implemented without actually using Macro(). Also, please note that we are not suggesting that you don\\'t\\nuse Macro(). It is fantastic and works very well; it just doesn\\'t nest efficiently.\\n\\nMacros | 157\\n\\x0cDefining Macros\\nLet\\'s take the dialplan logic we used above to set up voicemail for John and turn it into\\na macro. Then we\\'ll use the macro to give John and Jane (and the rest of their coworkers)\\nthe same functionality.\\nMacro definitions look a lot like contexts. (In fact, you could argue that they really are\\nsmall, limited contexts.) You define a macro by placing macro- and the name of your\\nmacro in square brackets, like this:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\n\\nMacro names must start with macro-. This distinguishes them from regular contexts.\\nThe commands within the macro are built almost identically to anything else in the\\ndialplan; the only limiting factor is that macros use only the s extension. Let\\'s add our\\nvoicemail logic to the macro, changing the extension to s as we go:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(101@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(101@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThat\\'s a start, but it\\'s not perfect, as it\\'s still specific to John and his mailbox number.\\nTo make the macro generic so that it will work not only for John but also for all of his\\ncoworkers, we\\'ll take advantage of another property of macros: arguments. But first,\\nlet\\'s see how we call macros in our dialplan.\\n\\nCalling Macros from the Dialplan\\nTo use a macro in our dialplan, we use the Macro() application. This application calls\\nthe specified macro and passes it any arguments. For example, to call our voicemail\\nmacro from our dialplan, we can do the following:\\nexten => 101,1,Macro(voicemail)\\n\\nThe Macro() application also defines several special variables for our use. They include:\\n${MACRO_CONTEXT}\\n\\nThe original context in which the macro was called.\\n${MACRO_EXTEN}\\n\\nThe original extension in which the macro was called.\\n${MACRO_PRIORITY}\\n\\nThe original priority in which the macro was called.\\n${ARG n }\\nThe nth argument passed to the macro. For example, the first argument would be\\n${ARG1}, the second ${ARG2}, and so on.\\n\\n158 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cAs we explained earlier, the way we initially defined our macro was hardcoded for John,\\ninstead of being generic. Let\\'s change our macro to use ${MACRO_EXTEN} instead of 101\\nfor the mailbox number. That way, if we call the macro from extension 101 the voicemail messages will go to mailbox 101, and if we call the macro from extension 102\\nmessages will go to mailbox 102, and so on:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN}@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(${MACRO_EXTEN}@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nUsing Arguments in Macros\\nOkay, now we\\'re getting closer to having the macro the way we want it, but we still\\nhave one thing left to change; we need to pass in the channel to dial, as it\\'s currently\\nstill hardcoded for ${JOHN} (remember that we defined the variable JOHN as the channel\\nto call when we want to reach John). Let\\'s pass in the channel as an argument, and\\nthen our first macro will be complete:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${ARG1},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(${MCARO_EXTEN}@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(${MCARO_EXTEN}@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNow that our macro is done, we can use it in our dialplan. Here\\'s how we can call our\\nmacro to provide voicemail to John, Jane, and Jack:\\nexten => 101,1,Macro(voicemail,${JOHN})\\nexten => 102,1,Macro(voicemail,${JANE})\\nexten => 103,1,Macro(voicemail,${JACK})\\n\\nWith 50 or more users, this dialplan will still look neat and organized; we\\'ll simply\\nhave one line per user, referencing a macro that can be as complicated as required. We\\ncould even have a few different macros for various user types, such as executives,\\ncourtesy_phones, call_center_agents, analog_sets, sales_department, and so on.\\nA more advanced version of the macro might look something like this:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${ARG1},20)\\nexten => s,n,Goto(s-${DIALSTATUS},1)\\nexten => s-NOANSWER,1,Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN},u)\\nexten => s-NOANSWER,n,Goto(incoming,s,1)\\nexten => s-BUSY,1,Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN},b)\\nexten => s-BUSY,n,Goto(incoming,s,1)\\nexten => _s-.,1,Goto(s-NOANSWER,1)\\n\\nMacros | 159\\n\\x0cThis macro depends on a nice side effect of the Dial() application: when you use the\\nDial() application, it sets the DIALSTATUS variable to indicate whether the call was successful or not. In this case, we\\'re handling the NOANSWER and BUSY cases, and treating all\\nother result codes as a NOANSWER.\\n\\nUsing the Asterisk Database (AstDB)\\nHaving fun yet? It gets even better!\\nAsterisk provides a powerful mechanism for storing values called the Asterisk database\\n(AstDB). The AstDB provides a simple way to store data for use within your dialplan.\\nFor those of you with experience using relational databases such as\\nPostgreSQL or MySQL, the Asterisk database is not a traditional relational database. It is a Berkeley DB Version 1 database. There are several\\nways to store data from Asterisk in a relational database. Check out\\nChapter 12 for a more about relational databases.\\n\\nThe Asterisk database stores its data in groupings called families, with values identified\\nby keys. Within a family, a key may be used only once. For example, if we had a family\\ncalled test, we could store only one value with a key called count. Each stored value\\nmust be associated with a family.\\n\\nStoring Data in the AstDB\\nTo store a new value in the Asterisk database, we use the Set() application,# but instead\\nof using it to set a channel variable, we use it to set an AstDB variable. For example, to\\nassign the count key in the test family with the value of 1, write the following:\\nexten => 456,1,Set(DB(test/count)=1)\\n\\nIf a key named count already exists in the test family, its value will be overwritten with\\nthe new value. You can also store values from the Asterisk command line, by running\\nthe command database put family key value. For our example, you would type data\\nbase put test count 1.\\n\\nRetrieving Data from the AstDB\\nTo retrieve a value from the Asterisk database and assign it to a variable, we use the\\nSet() application again. Let\\'s retrieve the value of count (again, from the test family),\\nassign it to a variable called COUNT, and then speak the value to the caller:\\n# Previous versions of Asterisk had applications called DBput() and DBget() that were used to set values in and\\n\\nretrieve values from the AstDB. If you\\'re using an old version of Asterisk, you\\'ll want to use those applications\\ninstead.\\n\\n160 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 456,1,Set(DB(test/count)=1)\\nexten => 456,n,Set(COUNT=${DB(test/count)})\\nexten => 456,n,SayNumber(${COUNT})\\n\\nYou may also check the value of a given key from the Asterisk command line by running\\nthe command database get family key. To view the entire contents of the AstDB, use\\nthe database show command.\\n\\nDeleting Data from the AstDB\\nThere are two ways to delete data from the Asterisk database. To delete a key, you can\\nuse the DB_DELETE() application. It takes the path to the key as its arguments, like this:\\n; deletes the key and returns its value in one step\\nexten => 457,1,Verbose(0, The value was ${DB_DELETE(test/count)})\\n\\nYou can also delete an entire key family by using the DBdeltree() application. The\\nDBdeltree() application takes a single argumentthe name of the key familyto delete.\\nTo delete the entire test family, do the following:\\nexten => 457,1,DBdeltree(test)\\n\\nTo delete keys and key families from the AstDB via the command-line interface, use\\nthe database del key and database deltree family commands, respectively.\\n\\nUsing the AstDB in the Dialplan\\nThere are an infinite number of ways to use the Asterisk database in a dialplan. To\\nintroduce the AstDB, we\\'ll show two simple examples. The first is a simple counting\\nexample to show that the Asterisk database is persistent (meaning that it survives system reboots). In the second example, we\\'ll use the BLACKLIST() function to evaluate\\nwhether or not a number is on the blacklist and should be blocked.\\nTo begin the counting example, let\\'s first retrieve a number (the value of the count key)\\nfrom the database and assign it to a variable named COUNT. If the key doesn\\'t exist, DB\\n() will return NULL (no value). In order to verify if a value exists in the database or\\nnot, we will introduce the ISNULL() function that will verify whether a value was returned, and if not, we will initialize the AstDB with the Set() application, where we\\nwill set the value in the database to 1. The next priority will send us back to priority 1.\\nThis will happen the very first time we dial this extension:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll say the current value of COUNT, and then increment COUNT:\\nexten => 678,1,Set(COUNT=${DB(test/count)})\\nexten => 678,n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${COUNT})}]?:continue)\\n\\nUsing the Asterisk Database (AstDB) | 161\\n\\x0cexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve incremented COUNT, let\\'s put the new value back into the database.\\nRemember that storing a value for an existing key overwrites the previous value:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll loop back to the first priority. This way, the application will continue\\ncounting:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nGo ahead and try this example. Listen to it count for a while, and then hang up. When\\nyou dial this extension again, it should continue counting from where it left off. The\\nvalue stored in the database will be persistent, even across a restart of Asterisk.\\nIn the next example, we\\'ll create dialplan logic around the BLACKLIST() function, which\\nchecks to see if the current Caller ID number exists in the blacklist. (The blacklist is\\nsimply a family called blacklist in the AstDB.) If BLACKLIST() finds the number in the\\nblacklist, it returns the value 1, otherwise it will return 0. We can use these values in\\ncombination with a GotoIf() to control whether the call will execute the Dial()\\napplication:\\nexten => 124,1,GotoIf($[${BLACKLIST()]?blocked,1)\\nexten => 124,n,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => blocked,1,Playback(privacy-you-are-blacklisted)\\nexten => blocked,n,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => blocked,n,Hangup()\\n\\nTo add a number to the blacklist, run the database put blacklist number 1 command\\nfrom the Asterisk command-line interface.\\n\\n162 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cHandy Asterisk Features\\nNow that we\\'ve gone over some more of the basics, let\\'s look at a few popular functions\\nthat have been incorporated into Asterisk.\\n\\nZapateller()\\nZapateller() is a simple Asterisk application that plays a special information tone at\\n\\nthe beginning of a call, which causes auto-dialers (usually used by telemarketers) to\\nthink that the line has been disconnected. Not only will they hang up, but their systems\\nwill flag your number as out of service, which could help you avoid all kinds of telemarketing calls. To use this functionality within your dialplan, simply call the\\nZapateller() application.\\nWe\\'ll also use the optional nocallerid option so that the tone will be played only when\\nthere is no Caller ID information on the incoming call. For example, you might use\\nZapateller() in the s extension of your [incoming] context, like this:\\n[incomimg]\\nexten => s,1,Zapateller(nocallerid)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(enter-ext-of-person)\\n\\nCall Parking\\nAnother handy feature is called call parking. Call parking allows you to place a call on\\nhold in a \"parking lot,\" so that it can be taken off hold from another extension. Parameters for call parking (such as the extensions to use, the number of spaces, and so\\non) are all controlled within the features.conf configuration file. The [general] section\\nof the features.conf file contains four settings related to call parking:\\nparkext\\n\\nThis is the parking lot extension. Transfer a call to this extension, and the system\\nwill tell you which parking position the call is in. By default, the parking extension\\nis 700.\\nparkpos\\n\\nThis option defines the number of parking slots. For example, setting it to\\n701-720 creates 20 parking positions, numbered 701 through 720.\\ncontext\\n\\nThis is the name of the parking context. To be able to park calls, you must include\\nthis context.\\nparkingtime\\n\\nIf set, this option controls how long (in seconds) a call can stay in the parking lot.\\nIf the call isn\\'t picked up within the specified time, the extension that parked the\\ncall will be called back.\\n\\nHandy Asterisk Features | 163\\n\\x0cYou must restart Asterisk after editing features.conf, as the file is read\\nonly on startup. Running the reload command will not cause the\\nfeatures.conf file to be read.\\n\\nAlso note that because the user needs to be able to transfer the calls to the parking lot\\nextension, you should make sure you\\'re using the t and/or T options to the Dial()\\napplication.\\nSo, let\\'s create a simple dialplan to show off call parking:\\n[incoming]\\ninclude => parkedcalls\\nexten => 103,1,Dial(SIP/Bob,,tT)\\nexten => 104,1,Dial(SIP/Charlie,,tT)\\n\\nTo illustrate how call parking works, say that Alice calls into the system and dials\\nextension 103 to reach Bob. After a while, Bob transfers the call to extension 700, which\\ntells him that the call from Alice has been parked in position 701. Bob then dials Charlie\\nat extension 104, and tells him that Alice is at extension 701. Charlie then dials extension 701 and begins to talk to Alice. This is a simple and effective way of allowing callers\\nto be transferred between users.\\nThe t and T arguments to Dial() are not needed on all channel types.\\nFor example, many SIP phones implement this via a softkey or hardkey\\nand utilize SIP signaling.\\n\\nConferencing with MeetMe()\\nLast but not least, let\\'s cover setting up an audio conference bridge with the MeetMe()\\napplication.* This application allows multiple callers to converse together, as if they\\nwere all in the same physical location. Some of the main features include:\\n The ability to create password-protected conferences\\n Conference administration (mute conference, lock conference, kick participants)\\n The option of muting all but one participant (useful for company announcements,\\nbroadcasts, etc.)\\n Static or dynamic conference creation\\nLet\\'s walk through setting up a basic conference room. The configuration options for\\nthe MeetMe conferencing system are found in meetme.conf. Inside the configuration\\nfile, you define conference rooms and optional numeric passwords. (If a password is\\n* In the world of legacy PBXes, this type of functionality is very expensive. Either you have to pay big bucks\\n\\nfor a dial-in service, or you have to add an expensive conferencing bridge to your proprietary PBX.\\n\\n164 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cdefined here, it will be required to enter all conferences using that room.) For our\\nexample, let\\'s set up a conference room at extension 600. First, we\\'ll set up the conference room in meetme.conf. We\\'ll call it 600, and we won\\'t assign a password at this\\ntime:\\n[rooms]\\nconf => 600\\n\\nNow that the configuration file is complete, we\\'ll need to restart Asterisk so that it can\\nreread the meetme.conf file. Next, we\\'ll add support for the conference room to our\\ndialplan with the MeetMe() application. MeetMe() takes three arguments: the name of\\nthe conference room (as defined in meetme.conf), a set of options, and the password\\nthe user must enter to join this conference. Let\\'s set up a simple conference using room\\n600, the i option (which announces when people enter and exit the conference), and a\\npassword of 54321:\\nexten => 600,1,MeetMe(600,i,54321)\\n\\nThat\\'s all there is to it! When callers enter extension 600, they will be prompted for the\\npassword. If they correctly enter 54321, they will be added to the conference. See Appendix B for a list of all the options supported by the MeetMe() application.\\nAnother useful application is MeetMeCount(). As its name suggests, this application\\ncounts the number of users in a particular conference room. It takes up to two\\narguments: the conference room in which to count the number of participants, and\\noptionally a variable name to assign the count to. If the variable name is not passed as\\nthe second argument, the count is read to the caller:\\nexten => 601,1,Playback(conf-thereare)\\nexten => 601,n,MeetMeCount(600)\\nexten => 601,n,Playback(conf-peopleinconf)\\n\\nIf you pass a variable as the second argument to MeetMeCount(), the count is assigned\\nto the variable, and playback of the count is skipped. You might use this to limit the\\nnumber of participants, like this:\\n; limit the conference room to 10 participants\\nexten => 600,1,MeetMeCount(600,CONFCOUNT)\\nexten => 600,n,GotoIf($[${CONFCOUNT} <= 10]?meetme:conf_full,1)\\nexten => 600,n(meetme),MeetMe(600,i,54321)\\nexten => conf_full,1,Playback(conf-full)\\n\\nIsn\\'t Asterisk fun?\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ve covered a few more of the many applications in the Asterisk\\ndialplan, and hopefully we\\'ve given you the seeds from which you can explore the\\ncreation of your own dialplans. As with the previous chapter, we invite you to go back\\nand reread any sections that require clarification.\\nConclusion | 165\\n\\x0cThe following chapters take us away from Asterisk for a bit, in order to talk about some\\nof the technologies that all telephone systems use. We\\'ll be referring to Asterisk a lot,\\nbut much of what we want to discuss are things that are common to many telecom\\nsystems.\\n\\n166 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0c\\nUnderstanding Telephony\\n\\nUtility is when you have one telephone, luxury is when\\nyou have two, opulence is when you have three--and\\nparadise is when you have none.\\n--Doug Larson\\n\\nWe\\'re now going to take a break from Asterisk for a chapter or two, because we want\\nto spend some time discussing the technologies with which your Asterisk system will\\nneed to interface. In this chapter, we are going to talk about some of the technologies\\nof the traditional telephone network--especially those that people most commonly\\nwant to connect to Asterisk. (We\\'ll discuss Voice over IP in the next chapter.)\\nWhile tomes could be written about the technologies in use in telecom networks, the\\nmaterial in this chapter was chosen based on our experiences in the community, which\\nhelped us to define the specific items that might be most useful. Although this knowledge may not be strictly required in order to configure your Asterisk system, it will be\\nof great benefit when interconnecting to systems (and talking with people) from the\\nworld of traditional telecommunications.\\n\\nAnalog Telephony\\nThe purpose of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is to establish and\\nmaintain audio connections between two endpoints in order to carry speech.\\nAlthough humans can perceive sound vibrations in the range of 2020,000 Hz,* most\\nof the sounds we make when speaking tend to be in the range of 2503,000 Hz. Since\\nthe purpose of the telephone network is to transmit the sounds of people speaking, it\\n* If you want to play around with what different frequencies look like on an oscilloscope, grab a copy of Sound\\n\\nFrequency Analyzer, from Reliable Software. It\\'s a really simple and fun way to visualize what sounds \"look\"\\nlike. The spectrograph gives a good picture of the complex harmonics our voices can generate, as well as an\\nappreciation for the background sounds that always surround us. You should also try the delightfully\\nannoying NCH Tone Generator, from NCH Swift Sound.\\n\\n\\x0cwas designed with a bandwidth of somewhere in the range of 3003,500 Hz. This\\nlimited bandwidth means that some sound quality will be lost (as anyone who\\'s had\\nto listen to music on hold can attest to), especially in the higher frequencies.\\n\\nParts of an Analog Telephone\\nAn analog phone is composed of five parts: the ringer, the dial pad, the hybrid (or\\nnetwork), and the hook switch and handset (both of which are considered parts of the\\nhybrid). The ringer, the dial pad, and the hybrid can operate completely independently\\nof one another.\\n\\nRinger\\nWhen the central office (CO) wants to signal an incoming call, it will connect an alternating current (AC) signal of roughly 90 volts to your circuit. This will cause the bell\\nin your telephone to produce a ringing sound. (In electronic telephones, this ringer may\\nbe a small electronic warbler rather than a bell. Ultimately, a ringer can be anything\\nthat is capable of reacting to the ringing voltage; for example, strobe lights are often\\nemployed in noisy environments such as factories.)\\nRinging voltage can be hazardous. Be very careful to take precautions\\nwhen working with an in-service telephone line.\\n\\nMany people confuse the AC voltage that triggers the ringer with the direct current\\n(DC) voltage that powers the phone. Remember that a ringer needs an alternating current in order to oscillate (just as a church bell won\\'t ring if you don\\'t supply the\\nmovement), and you\\'ve got it.\\nIn North America, the number of ringers you can connect to your line is dependent on\\nthe Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) of your various devices. (The REN must be\\nlisted on each device.) The total REN for all devices connected to your line cannot\\nexceed 5.0. An REN of 1.0 is equivalent to an old-fashioned analog set with an electromechanical ringer. Some electronic phones have an REN of 0.3 or even less. If you\\nconnect too many devices that require too much current, you will find that none of\\nthem will be able to ring.\\n\\nDial pad\\nWhen you place a telephone call, you need some way of letting the network know the\\naddress of the party you wish to reach. The dial pad is the portion of the phone that\\nprovides this functionality. In the early days of the PSTN, dial pads were in fact rotary\\ndevices that used pulses to indicate digits. This was a rather slow process, so the telephone companies eventually introduced touch-tone dialing. With touch-tone--also\\n\\n168 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cknown as Dual-Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)--dialing, the dial pad consists of 12\\nbuttons. Each button has two frequencies assigned to it (see Table 7-1).\\nTable 7-1. DTMF digits\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1633 Hz a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC\\n\\n\\n*\\n\\n\\n#\\n\\nD\\n\\nNotice that this column contains letters that are not typically present as keys on a telephone dial pad. They are part of the DTMF standard\\nnonetheless, and any proper telephone contains the electronics required to create them, even if it doesn\\'t contain the buttons themselves.\\n(These buttons actually do exist on some telephones, which are mostly used in military and government applications.)\\n\\nWhen you press a button on your dial pad, the two corresponding frequencies are\\ntransmitted down the line. The far end can interpret these frequencies and note which\\ndigit was pressed.\\n\\nHybrid (or network)\\nThe hybrid is a type of transformer that handles the need to combine the signals transmitted and received across a single pair of wires in the PSTN and two pairs of wires in\\nthe handset. One of the functions the hybrid performs is regulating sidetone, which is\\nthe amount of your transmitted signal that is returned to your earpiece; its purpose is\\nto provide a more natural-sounding conversation. Too much sidetone, and your voice\\nwill sound too loud; too little, and you\\'ll think the line has gone dead.\\nHook switch (or switch hook). This device signals the state of the telephone circuit to the CO.\\nWhen you pick up your telephone, the hook switch closes the loop between you and\\nthe CO, which is seen as a request for a dial tone. When you hang up, the hook switch\\nopens the circuit, which indicates that the call has ended.\\nThe hook switch can also be used for signaling purposes. Some electronic analog\\nphones have a button labeled Link that causes an event called a flash. You can perform\\na flash manually by depressing the hook switch for a duration of between 200 and 1,200\\nmilliseconds. If you leave it down for longer than that, the carrier may assume you\\'ve\\nhung up. The purpose of the Link button is to handle this timing for you. If you\\'ve ever\\nused call waiting or three-way calling on an analog line, you have performed a hook\\nswitch flash for the purpose of signaling the network.\\n\\n When referring to the state of an analog circuit, people often speak in terms of \"off-hook\" and \"on-hook.\"\\n\\nWhen your line is \"off-hook,\" your telephone is \"on\" a call. If your phone is \"on-hook,\" the telephone is\\nessentially \"off,\" or idle.\\n\\nAnalog Telephony | 169\\n\\x0cRing\\n\\nTip\\n\\nFigure 7-1. Tip and Ring\\n\\nHandset. The handset is composed of the transmitter and receiver. It performs the conversion between the sound energy humans use and the electrical energy the telephone\\nnetwork uses.\\n\\nTip and Ring\\nIn an analog telephone circuit, there are two wires. In North America, these wires are\\nreferred to as Tip and Ring. This terminology comes from the days when telephone\\ncalls were connected by live operators sitting at cord boards. The plugs that they used\\nhad two contactsone located at the tip of the plug and the other connected to the ring\\naround the middle (Figure 7-1).\\nThe Tip lead is the positive polarity wire. In North America, this wire is typically green\\nand provides the return path. The Ring wire is the negative polarity wire. In North\\nAmerica, this wire is normally red. For modern Cat 5 and 6 cables, the Tip is usually\\nthe white wire, and Ring is the coloured wire. When your telephone is on-hook, this\\nwire will have a potential of 48V DC with respect to Tip. Off-hook, this voltage drops\\nto roughly 7V DC.\\n\\nDigital Telephony\\nAnalog telephony is almost dead.\\nIn the PSTN, the famous Last Mile is the final remaining piece of the telephone network\\nstill using technology pioneered well over a hundred years ago.\\nOne of the primary challenges when transmitting analog signals is that all sorts of things\\ncan interfere with those signals, causing low volume, static, and all manner of other\\nundesired effects. Instead of trying to preserve an analog waveform over distances that\\nmay span thousands of miles, why not simply measure the characteristics of the original\\n\\n They may have other names elsewhere in the world (such as \"A\" and \"B\").\\n \"The Last Mile\" is a term that was originally used to describe the only portion of the PSTN that had not been\\n\\nconverted to fiber optics: the connection between the central office and the customer. The Last Mile is more\\nthan that, however, as it also has significance as a valuable asset of the traditional phone companies; they\\nown a connection into your home. The Last Mile is becoming more and more difficult to describe in technical\\nterms, as there are now so many ways to connect the network to the customer. As a thing of strategic value\\nto telecom, cable, and other utilities, its importance is obvious.\\n\\n170 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0csound and send that information to the far end? The original waveform wouldn\\'t get\\nthere, but all the information needed to reconstruct it would.\\nThis is the principle of all digital audio (including telephony): sample the characteristics\\nof the source waveform, store the measured information, and send that data to the far\\nend. Then, at the far end, use the transmitted information to generate a completely new\\naudio signal that has the same characteristics as the original. The reproduction is so\\ngood that the human ear can\\'t tell the difference.\\nThe principle advantage of digital audio is that the sampled data can be mathematically\\nchecked for errors all along the route to its destination, ensuring that a perfect duplicate\\nof the original arrives at the far end. Distance no longer affects quality, and interference\\ncan be detected and eliminated.\\n\\nPulse-Code Modulation\\nThere are several ways to digitally encode audio, but the most common method (and\\nthe one used in telephony systems) is known as Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM). To\\nillustrate how this works, let\\'s go through a few examples.\\n\\nDigitally encoding an analog waveform\\nThe principle of PCM is that the amplitudeof the analog waveform is sampled at specific intervals so that it can later be re-created. The amount of detail that is captured is\\ndependent both on the bit resolution of each sample and on how frequently the samples\\nare taken. A higher bit resolution and a higher sampling rate will provide greater accuracy, but more bandwidth will be required to transmit this more detailed information.\\nTo get a better idea of how PCM works, consider the waveform displayed in Figure 7-2.\\nTo digitally encode the wave, it must be sampled on a regular basis, and the amplitude\\nof the wave at each moment in time must be measured. The process of slicing up a\\nwaveform into moments in time and measuring the energy at each moment is called\\nquantization, or sampling.\\nThe samples will need to be taken frequently enough and will need to capture enough\\ninformation to ensure that the far end can re-create a sufficiently similar waveform. To\\nachieve a more accurate sample, more bits will be required. To explain this concept,\\nwe will start with a very low resolution, using four bits to represent our amplitude. This\\nwill make it easier to visualize both the quantization process itself and the effect that\\nresolution has on quality.\\n\\n Amplitude is essentially the power or strength of the signal. If you have ever held a skipping rope or garden\\n\\nhose and given it a whip, you have seen the resultant wave. The taller the wave, the greater the amplitude.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 171\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-2.

Sampling our sine wave using four bits\\n\\nFigure 7-3 shows the information that will be captured when we sample our sine wave\\nat four-bit resolution.\\nAt each time interval, we measure the amplitude of the wave and record the corresponding intensity--in other words, we sample it. You will notice that the four-bit\\nresolution limits our accuracy. The first sample has to be rounded to 0011, and the next\\nquantization yields a sample of 0101. Then comes 0100, followed by 1001, 1011, and so\\nforth. In total, we have 14 samples (in reality, several thousand samples must be taken\\nper second).\\n\\n172 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-4.

This was done intentionally, to demonstrate an important point: the quality of the digitally encoded waveform is affected by the resolution\\nand rate at which it is sampled. At too low a sampling rate, and with too low a sample\\nresolution, the audio quality will not be acceptable.\\n\\nIncreasing the sampling resolution and rate\\nLet\\'s take another look at our original waveform, this time using five bits to define our\\nquantization intervals (Figure 7-7).\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 173\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-6.

Here they are:\\n\\nWhen received at the other end, that information can now be plotted as shown in\\nFigure 7-9.\\nFrom this information, the waveform shown in Figure 7-10 can then be generated.\\nAs you can see, the resultant waveform is a far more accurate representation of the\\noriginal. However, you can also see that there is still room for improvement.\\nNote that 40 bits were required to encode the waveform at 4-bit resolution, while 156 bits were needed to send the same waveform using 5bit resolution (and also doubling the sampling rate). The point is, there\\nis a tradeoff: the higher the quality of audio you wish to encode, the\\nmore bits required to do it, and the more bits you wish to send (in real\\ntime, naturally), the more bandwidth you will need to consume.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 175\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-9.

That very same question was considered in the 1920s\\nby an electrical engineer (and AT&T/Bell employee) named Harry Nyquist. Nyquist\\'s\\nTheorem states: \"When sampling a signal, the sampling frequency must be greater than\\ntwice the bandwidth of the input signal in order to be able to reconstruct the original\\nperfectly from the sampled version.\"*\\n\\n176 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cIn essence, what this means is that to accurately encode an analog signal you have to\\nsample it twice as often as the total bandwidth you wish to reproduce. Since the telephone network will not carry frequencies below 300 Hz and above 4,000 Hz, a sampling\\nfrequency of 8,000 samples per second will be sufficient to reproduce any frequency\\nwithin the bandwidth of an analog telephone. Keep that 8,000 samples per second in\\nmind; we\\'re going to talk about it more later.\\n\\nLogarithmic companding\\nSo, we\\'ve gone over the basics of quantization, and we\\'ve discussed the fact that more\\nquantization intervals (i.e., a higher sampling rate) give better quality but also require\\nmore bandwidth. Lastly, we\\'ve discussed the minimum sample rate needed to accurately measure the range of frequencies we wish to be able to transmit (in the case of\\nthe telephone, it\\'s 8,000 Hz). This is all starting to add up to a fair bit of data being\\nsent on the wire, so we\\'re going to want to talk about companding.\\nCompanding is a method of improving the dynamic range of a sampling method without\\nlosing important accuracy. It works by quantizing higher amplitudes in a much coarser\\nfashion than lower amplitudes. In other words, if you yell into your phone, you will\\nnot be sampled as cleanly as you will be when speaking normally. Yelling is also not\\ngood for your blood pressure, so it\\'s best to avoid it.\\nTwo companding methods are commonly employed: law in North America, and\\nalaw in the rest of the world. They operate on the same principles but are otherwise\\nnot compatible with each other.\\nCompanding divides the waveform into cords, each of which has several steps. Quantization involves matching the measured amplitude to an appropriate step within a\\ncord. The value of the band and cord numbers (as well as the sign--positive or negative)\\nbecomes the signal. The following diagrams will give you a visual idea of what companding does. They are not based on any standard, but rather were made up for the\\npurpose of illustration (again, in the telephone network, companding will be done at\\nan eight-bit, not five-bit, resolution).\\nFigure 7-11 illustrates five-bit companding. As you can see, amplitudes near the zerocrossing point will be sampled far more accurately than higher amplitudes (either\\npositive or negative). However, since the human ear, the transmitter, and the receiver\\nwill also tend to distort loud signals, this isn\\'t really a problem.\\n* Nyquist published two papers, \"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed\" (1924) and \"Certain Topics in\\n\\nTelegraph Transmission Theory\" (1928), in which he postulated what became known as Nyquist\\'s Theorem.\\nProven in 1949 by Claude Shannon (\"Communication in the Presence of Noise\"), it is also referred to as the\\nNyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\\n law is often referred to as \"ulaw\" because, let\\'s face it, how many of us have  keys on our keyboards?  is\\n\\nin fact the Greek letter Mu; thus, you will also see law written (more correctly) as \"Mu-law.\" When spoken,\\nit is correct to confidently say \"Mew-law,\" but if folks look at you strangely, and you\\'re feeling generous, you\\ncan help them out and tell them it\\'s \"ulaw.\" Many people just don\\'t appreciate trivia.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 177\\n\\x0cSign-bit Cord-bit\\n\\n\\nStep-bit\\n\\n\\nLow accuracy\\n\\n\\n\\nReduced accuracy\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\n\\nAccurate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHighly accurate\\nHighly accurate\\n\\n\\nAccurate\\n\\n\\nReduced accuracy\\n\\n\\n\\nLow accuracy\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nFigure 7-11.

In PSTN, that includes any audio frequencies above\\n4,000 Hz (half the sampling rate of 8,000 Hz). This problem is easily corrected by\\npassing the audio through a low-pass filter before presenting it to the A/D converter.\\n A low-pass filter, as its name implies, allows through only frequencies that are lower than its cut-off frequency.\\n\\nOther types of filters are high-pass filters (which remove low frequencies) and band-pass filters (which filter\\nout both high and low frequencies).\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 179\\n\\x0cThe Digital Circuit-Switched Telephone Network\\nFor over a hundred years, telephone networks were exclusively circuit-switched. What\\nthis meant was that for every telephone call made, a dedicated connection was established between the two endpoints, with a fixed amount of bandwidth allocated to that\\ncircuit. Creating such a network was costly, and where distance was concerned, using\\nthat network was costly as well. Although we are all predicting the end of the circuitswitched network, many people still use it every day, and it really does work rather well.\\n\\nCircuit Types\\nIn the PSTN, there are many different sizes of circuits serving the various needs of the\\nnetwork. Between the central office and a subscriber, one or more analog circuits, or a\\nfew dozen channels delivered over a digital circuit, generally suffice. Between PSTN\\noffices (and with larger customers), fiber-optic circuits are generally used.\\n\\nThe humble DS-0the foundation of it all\\nSince the standard method of digitizing a telephone call is to record an 8-bit sample\\n8,000 times per second, we can see that a PCM-encoded telephone circuit will need a\\nbandwidth of eight times 8,000 bits per second, or 64,000 bps. This 64 Kbps channel\\nis referred to as a DS-0 (that\\'s \"Dee-Ess-Zero\"). The DS-0 is the fundamental building\\nblock of all digital telecommunications circuits.\\nEven the ubiquitous analog circuit is sampled into a DS-0 as soon as possible. Sometimes this happens where your circuit terminates at the central office, and sometimes\\nwell before.\\n\\nT-carrier circuits\\nThe venerable T1 is one of the more recognized digital telephony terms. A T1 is a digital\\ncircuit consisting of 24 DS-0s multiplexed together into a 1.544 Mbps bitstream.# This\\nbit stream is properly defined as a DS-1. Voice is encoded on a T1 using the law\\ncompanding algorithm.\\n\\n If you ever have to do audio recordings for a system, you might want to take advantage of the band-pass filter\\n\\nthat is built into most telephone sets. Doing a recording using even high-end recording equipment can pick\\nup all kinds of background noise that you don\\'t even hear until you downsample, at which point the\\nbackground noise produces aliasing (which can sound like all kinds of weird things). Conversely, the phone\\nrecords in the correct format already, so the noise never enters the audio stream. Having said all that, no\\nmatter what you use to do recordings, avoid environments that have a lot of background noise. Typical offices\\ncan be a lot noisier than you\\'d think, as HVAC equipment can produce noise that we don\\'t even realize is there.\\n Digital telephone sets (including IP sets) do the analog-to-digital conversion right at the point where the\\n\\nhandset plugs into the phone, so the DS-0 is created right at the phone set.\\n# The 24 DS-0s use 1.536 Mbps, and the remaining .008 Mbps is used by framing bits.\\n\\n180 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cThe European version of the T1 was developed by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations* (CEPT),\\nand was first referred to as a CEPT-1. It is now called an E1.\\nThe E1 is comprised of 32 DS-0s, but the method of PCM encoding is\\ndifferent: E1s use alaw companding. This means that connecting between an E1-based network and a T1-based network will always require\\na transcoding step. Note that an E1, although it has 32 channels, is also\\nconsidered a DS-1. It is likely that E1 is far more widely deployed, as it\\nis used everywhere in the world except North American and Japan.\\n\\nThe various other T-carriers (T2, T3, and T4) are multiples of the T1, each based on\\nthe humble DS-0. Table 7-2 illustrates the relationships between the different T-carrier\\ncircuits.\\nTable 7-2.

For these speeds,\\noptical carrier (OC) circuits may be used.\\n\\nSONET and OC circuits\\nThe Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) was developed out of a desire to take the\\nT-carrier system to the next technological level: fiber optics. SONET is based on the\\nbandwidth of a T3 (44.736 Mbps), with a slight overhead making it 51.84 Mbps. This\\nis referred to as an OC-1 or STS-1.

Mechanisms must also be provided to pass information about\\nthe state of the channel between each endpoint. (Disconnect and answer supervision\\nare two examples of basic signaling that might need to take place; Caller ID is an example of a more complex form of signaling.)\\n\\nChannel Associated Signaling (CAS)\\nAlso known as robbed-bit signaling, CAS is what you will use to transmit voice on a\\nT1 when ISDN is not available. Rather than taking advantage of the power of the digital\\ncircuit, CAS simulates analog channels. CAS works by stealing bits from the audio\\nstream for signaling purposes. Although the effect on audio quality is not really noticeable, the lack of a powerful signaling channel limits your flexibility.\\nWhen configuring a CAS T1, the signaling options at each end must match. E&M (Ear\\n& Mouth or recEive & transMit) signaling is generally preferred, as it offers the best\\nsupervision. Having said that, in an Asterisk environment the most likely reason for\\nyou to use CAS would be for a channel bank, which means you are most likely going\\nto have to use FXS signaling.\\nCAS is very rarely used on PSTN circuits anymore, due to the superiority of ISDN-PRI.\\nOne of the limitations of CAS is that it does not allow the dynamic assignment of\\nchannels to different functions. Also, Caller ID information (which may not even be\\nsupported) has to be sent as part of the audio stream. CAS is commonly used on the\\nT1 link in channel banks.\\n\\nISDN\\nThe Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) has been around for more than 20\\nyears. Because it separates the channels that carry the traffic (the bearer channels, or\\nB-channels) from the channel that carries the signaling information (the D-channel),\\nISDN allows for the delivery of a much richer set of features than CAS. In the beginning,\\nISDN promised to deliver much the same sort of functionality that the Internet has\\ngiven us, including advanced capabilities for voice, video, and data transfer.\\nUnfortunately, rather than ratifying a standard and sticking to it, the respective telecommunications manufacturers all decided to add their own tweaks to the protocol,\\nin the belief that their versions were superior and would eventually dominate the market. As a result, getting two ISDN-compliant systems to connect to each other was often\\na painful and expensive task. The carriers who had to implement and support this\\n\\n182 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cexpensive technology, in turn, priced it so that it was not rapidly adopted. Currently,\\nISDN is rarely used for much more than basic trunking--in fact, the acronym ISDN\\nhas become a joke in the industry: \"It Still Does Nothing.\"\\nHaving said that, ISDN has become quite popular for trunking, and it is now (mostly)\\nstandards-compliant. If you have a PBX with more than a dozen lines connected to the\\nPSTN, there\\'s a very good chance that you\\'ll be running an ISDN-PRI (Primary Rate\\nInterface) circuit. Also, in places where DSL and cable access to the Internet are not\\navailable (or are too expensive), an ISDN-BRI (Basic Rate Interface) circuit might provide you with an affordable 128 Kbps connection. In much of North America, the use\\nof BRI for Internet connectivity has been deprecated in favor of DSL and cable modems\\n(and it is never used for voice), but in many European countries it has almost totally\\nreplaced analog circuits.\\nISDN-BRI/BRA. Basic Rate Interface (or Basic Rate Access) is the flavor of ISDN, and is\\ndesigned to service small endpoints such as workstations.\\nThe BRI flavor of the ISDN specification is often referred to simply as \"ISDN,\" but this\\ncan be a source of confusion, as ISDN is a protocol, not a type of circuit (not to mention\\nthat PRI circuits are also correctly referred to as ISDN!).\\nA Basic Rate ISDN circuit consists of two 64 Kbps B-channels controlled by a 16-Kbps\\nD-channel, for a total of 144 Kbps.\\nBasic Rate ISDN has been a source of much confusion during its life, due to problems\\nwith standards compliance, technical complexity, and poor documentation. Still, many\\nEuropean telecos have widely implemented ISDN-BRI, and thus it is more popular in\\nEurope than in North America.\\nISDN-PRI/PRA. The Primary Rate Interface (or Primary Rate Access) flavor of ISDN is used\\nto provide ISDN service over larger network connections. A Primary Rate ISDN circuit\\nuses a single DS-0 channel as a signaling link (the D-channel); the remaining channels\\nserve as B-channels.\\nIn North America, Primary Rate ISDN is commonly carried on one or more T1 circuits.\\nSince a T1 has 24 channels, a North American PRI circuit typically consists of 23 Bchannels and 1 D-channel. For this reason, PRI is often referred to as 23B+D.\\nIn Europe, a 32-channel E1 circuit is used, so a Primary Rate ISDN circuit is referred to as 30B+D (the final channel is used for\\nsynchronization).\\n\\n PRI is actually quite a bit more flexible than that, as it is possible to span a single PRI circuit across multiple\\n\\nT1 spans. This can give rise, for example, to a 47B+D circuit (where a single D-channel serves two T1s) or a\\n46B+2D circuit (where primary and backup D-channels serve a pair of T1s). You will sometimes see PRI\\ndescribed as nB+nD, because the number of B- and D-channels is, in fact, quite variable. For this reason, you\\nshould never refer to a T1 carrying PRI as \"a PRI.\" For all you know, the PRI circuit spans multiple T1s, as\\nis common in larger PBX deployments.\\n\\nThe Digital Circuit-Switched Telephone Network | 183\\n\\x0cPrimary Rate ISDN is very popular, due to its technical benefits and generally competitive pricing at higher densities. If you believe you will require more than a dozen or so\\nPSTN lines, you should look into Primary Rate ISDN pricing.\\nFrom a technical perspective, ISDN-PRI is always preferable to CAS.\\n\\nSignaling System 7\\nSignaling System 7 (SS7) is the signaling system used by carriers. It is conceptually\\nsimilar to ISDN, and it is instrumental in providing a mechanism for the carriers to\\ntransmit the additional information ISDN endpoints typically need to pass. However,\\nthe technology of SS7 is different from that of ISDN; one big difference is that SS7 runs\\non a completely separate network from the actual trunks that carry the calls.\\nSS7 support in Asterisk is on the horizon, as there is much interest in making Asterisk\\ncompatible with the carrier networks. An open source version of SS7 (http://\\nwww.openss7.org) exists, but work is still needed for full SS7 compliance, and as of this\\nwriting it is not known whether this version will be integrated with Asterisk. Another\\npromising source of SS7 support comes from Sangoma Technologies, which offers SS7\\nfunctionality in many of its products.\\nIt should be noted that adding support for SS7 in Asterisk is not going to be as simple\\nas writing a proper driver. Connecting equipment to an SS7 network will not be possible\\nwithout that equipment having passed extremely rigorous certification processes. Even\\nthen, it seems doubtful that any traditional carrier is going to be in a hurry to allow\\nsuch a thing to happen, mostly for strategic and political reasons.\\n\\nPacket-Switched Networks\\nIn the mid-1990s, network performance improved to the point where it became possible\\nto send a stream of media information in real time across a network connection. Because\\nthe media stream is chopped up into segments, which are then wrapped in an addressing envelope, such connections are referred to as packet-based. The challenge, of course,\\nis to send a flood of these packets between two endpoints, ensuring that the packets\\narrive in the same order in which they were sent, in less than 150 milliseconds, with\\nnone lost. This is the essence of Voice over IP.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis chapter has explored the technologies currently in use in the PSTN. In the next\\nchapter, we will discuss protocols for VoIP: the carrying of telephone connections\\nacross IP-based networks. These protocols define different mechanisms for carrying\\ntelephone conversations, but their significance is far greater than just that. Bringing the\\ntelephone network into the data network will finally erase the line between telephones\\nand computers, which holds the promise of a revolutionary evolution in the way we\\ncommunicate.\\n184 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0c\\nProtocols for VoIP\\n\\nThe Internet is a telephone system that\\'s gotten uppity.\\n--Clifford Stoll\\n\\nThe telecommunications industry spans over 100 years, and Asterisk integrates most\\n--if not all--of the major technologies that it has made use of over the last century. To\\nmake the most out of Asterisk, you need not be a professional in all areas, but understanding the differences between the various codecs and protocols will give you a\\ngreater appreciation and understanding of the system as a whole.\\nThis chapter explains Voice over IP and what makes VoIP networks different from the\\ntraditional circuit-switched voice networks that were the topic of the last chapter.

The challenges to accomplishing this relate to the\\nmanner in which humans communicate. Not only must the signal arrive in essentially\\nthe same form that it was transmitted in, but it needs to do so in less than 150 milliseconds. If packets are lost or delayed, there will be degradation to the quality of the\\ncommunications experience, meaning that two people will have difficulty in carrying\\non a conversation.\\nThe transport protocols that collectively are called \"the Internet\" were not originally\\ndesigned with real-time streaming of media in mind. Endpoints were expected to resolve missing packets by waiting longer for them to arrive, requesting retransmission,\\nor, in some cases, considering the information to be gone for good and simply carrying\\non without it. In a typical voice conversation, these mechanisms will not serve. Our\\nconversations do not adapt well to the loss of letters or words, nor to any appreciable\\ndelay between transmittal and receipt.\\nThe traditional PSTN was designed specifically for the purpose of voice transmission,\\nand it is perfectly suited to the task from a technical standpoint. From a flexibility\\nstandpoint, however, its flaws are obvious to even people with a very limited understanding of the technology. VoIP holds the promise of incorporating voice communications into all of the other protocols we carry on our networks, but due to the special\\ndemands of a voice conversation, special skills are needed to design, build, and maintain\\nthese networks.\\nThe problem with packet-based voice transmission stems from the fact that the way in\\nwhich we speak is totally incompatible with the way in which IP transports data.\\n* This word hasn\\'t quite made it into the dictionary, but it is a term that is becoming more and more common.\\n\\nIt refers to the process of chopping a steady stream of information into discrete chunks (or packets), suitable\\nfor delivery independently of one another.\\n\\n186 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cSpeaking and listening consist of the relaying of a stream of audio, whereas the Internet\\nprotocols are designed to chop everything up, encapsulate the bits of information into\\nthousands of packages, and then deliver each package in whatever way possible to the\\nfar end. Clearly, some way of dealing with this is required.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols\\nThe mechanism for carrying a VoIP connection generally involves a series of signaling\\ntransactions between the endpoints (and gateways in between), culminating into two\\npersistent media streams (one for each direction) that carry the actual conversation.\\nThere are several protocols in existence to handle this. In this section, we will discuss\\nsome of those that are important to VoIP in general and to Asterisk specifically.\\n\\nIAX (The \"Inter-Asterisk eXchange\" Protocol)\\nIf you claim to be one of the folks in the know when it comes to Asterisk, your test will\\ncome when you have to pronounce the name of this protocol. It would seem that you\\nshould say \"eye-ay-ex\", but this hardly rolls off the tongue very well. Fortunately, the\\nproper pronunciation is in fact \"eeks.\" IAX is an open protocol, meaning that anyone\\ncan download and develop for it, but it is not yet a standard of any kind.\\nIt is expected that IAX2 will become an IETF protocol soon. IAX2 is currently in draft\\nstatus with the IETF, and it is widely expected to become an official protocol in a few\\nyears\\' time.\\nIn Asterisk, IAX is supported by the chan_iax2.so module.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe IAX protocol was developed by Digium for the purpose of communicating with\\nother Asterisk servers (hence the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol). It is very important\\nto note that IAX is not at all limited to Asterisk. The standard is open for anyone to\\nuse, and it is supported by many other open source telecom projects, as well as by\\nseveral hardware vendors. IAX is a transport protocol (much like SIP) that uses a single\\nUDP port (4569) for both the channel signaling and media streams. As discussed later\\nin this chapter, this makes it easier to manage when behind NATed firewalls.\\nIAX also has the unique ability to trunk multiple sessions into one dataflow, which can\\nbe a tremendous bandwidth advantage when sending a lot of simultaneous channels\\nto a remote box. Trunking allows multiple media streams to be represented with a\\n It sounds like the name of a Dutch football team.\\n Go ahead. Say it. Now that sounds much better, doesn\\'t it?\\n Officially, the current version is IAX2, but all support for IAX1 has been dropped, so whether you say \"IAX\"\\n\\nor \"IAX2,\" it is expected that you are talking about the same version.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 187\\n\\x0csingle datagram header, that will lower the overhead associated with individual\\nchannels. This helps to lower latency and reduce the processing power and bandwidth\\nrequired, allowing the protocol to scale much more easily with a large number of active\\nchannels between endpoints. If you have a large quantity of IP calls to pass between\\ntwo endpoints, you should take a close look at IAX trunking.\\n\\nFuture\\nSince IAX was optimized for voice, it has received some criticism for not better supporting video--but in fact, IAX holds the potential to carry pretty much any media\\nstream desired. Because it is an open protocol, future media types are certain to be\\nincorporated as the community desires them.\\n\\nSecurity considerations\\nIAX includes the ability to authenticate in three ways: plain text, MD5 hashing, and\\nRSA key exchange. This, of course, does nothing to encrypt the media path or headers\\nbetween endpoints. Many solutions include using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\\nappliance or software to encrypt the stream in another layer of technology, which requires the endpoints to pre-establish a method of having these tunnels configured and\\noperational. However, IAX is now also able to encrypt the streams between endpoints\\nwith dynamic key exchange at call setup (using the configuration option encryp\\ntion=aes128), allowing the use of automatic key rollover.\\n\\nIAX and NAT\\nThe IAX2 protocol was deliberately designed to work from behind devices performing\\nNAT. The use of a single UDP port for both signaling and transmission of media also\\nkeeps the number of holes required in your firewall to a minimum. These considerations\\nhave helped make IAX one of the easiest protocols (if not the easiest) to implement in\\nsecure networks.\\n\\nSIP\\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has taken the telecommunications industry by\\nstorm. SIP has pretty much dethroned the once-mighty H.323 as the VoIP protocol of\\nchoice--certainly at the endpoints of the network. The premise of SIP is that each end\\nof a connection is a peer; the protocol negotiates capabilities between them. What\\nmakes SIP compelling is that it is a relatively simple protocol, with a syntax similar to\\nthat of other familiar protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. SIP is supported in Asterisk\\nwith the chan_sip.so module.\\n\\nHistory\\nSIP was originally submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in February\\nof 1996 as \"draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-00.\" The initial draft looked nothing like the SIP we\\n188 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cSIP signaling\\n\\nRTP media\\n\\nFigure 8-1. The SIP trapezoid\\n\\nknow today and contained only a single request type: a call setup request. In March of\\n1999, after 11 revisions, SIP RFC 2543 was born.\\nAt first, SIP was all but ignored, as H.323 was considered the protocol of choice for\\nVoIP transport negotiation. However, as the buzz grew, SIP began to gain popularity,\\nand while there may be a lot of different factors that accelerated its growth, we\\'d like\\nto think that a large part of its success is due to its freely available specification.\\nSIP is an application-layer signaling protocol that uses the well-known port 5060 for\\ncommunications. SIP can be transported with either the UDP or TCP transport-layer\\nprotocols. Asterisk does not currently have a TCP implementation for transporting SIP\\nmessages, but it is possible that future versions may support it (and patches to the code\\nbase are gladly accepted). SIP is used to \"establish, modify, and terminate multimedia\\nsessions such as Internet telephony calls.\"#\\nSIP does not transport media between endpoints.\\nRTP is used to transmit media (i.e., voice) between endpoints. RTP uses high-numbered, unprivileged ports in Asterisk (10,000 through 20,000, by default).\\nA common topology to illustrate SIP and RTP, commonly referred to as the \"SIP trapezoid,\" is shown in Figure 8-1. When Alice wants to call Bob, Alice\\'s phone contacts\\nher proxy server, and the proxy tries to find Bob (often connecting through his proxy).\\nOnce the phones have started the call, they communicate directly with each other (if\\npossible), so that the data doesn\\'t have to tie up the resources of the proxy.\\nSIP was not the first, and is not the only, VoIP protocol in use today (others include H.\\n323, MGCP, IAX, and so on), but currently it seems to have the most momentum with\\nhardware vendors. The advantages of the SIP protocol lie in its wide acceptance and\\narchitectural flexibility (and, we used to say, simplicity!).\\n\\n Having just called SIP simple, it should be noted that it is by no means lightweight. It has been said that if\\n\\none were to read all of the IETF RFCs that are relevant to SIP, one would have more than 3,000 pages of\\nreading to do. SIP is quickly earning a reputation for being far too bloated, but that does nothing to lessen\\nits popularity.\\n# RFC 3261, SIP: Session Initiation Protocol, p. 9, Section 2.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 189\\n\\x0cFuture\\nSIP has earned its place as the protocol that justified VoIP. All new user and enterprise\\nproducts are expected to support SIP, and any existing products will now be a tough\\nsell unless a migration path to SIP is offered. SIP is widely expected to deliver far more\\nthan VoIP capabilities, including the ability to transmit video, music, and any type of\\nreal-time multimedia. While its use as a ubiquitous general-purpose media transport\\nmechanism seems doubtful, SIP is unarguably poised to deliver the majority of new\\nvoice applications for the next few years.\\n\\nSecurity considerations\\nSIP uses a challenge/response system to authenticate users. An initial INVITE is sent to\\nthe proxy with which the end device wishes to communicate. The proxy then sends\\nback a 407 Proxy Authorization Request message, which contains a random set of\\ncharacters referred to as a nonce. This nonce is used along with the password to generate\\nan MD5 hash, which is then sent back in the subsequent INVITE. Assuming the MD5\\nhash matches the one that the proxy generated, the client is then authenticated.\\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks are probably the most common type of attack on VoIP\\ncommunications. A DoS attack can occur when a large number of invalid INVITE requests are sent to a proxy server in an attempt to overwhelm the system. These attacks\\nare relatively simple to implement, and their effects on the users of the system are\\nimmediate. SIP has several methods of minimizing the effects of DoS attacks, but ultimately they are impossible to prevent.\\nSIP implements a scheme to guarantee that a secure, encrypted transport mechanism\\n(namely Transport Layer Security, or TLS) is used to establish communication between\\nthe caller and the domain of the callee. Beyond that, the request is sent securely to the\\nend device, based upon the local security policies of the network. Note that the encryption of the media (that is, the RTP stream) is beyond the scope of SIP itself and\\nmust be dealt with separately.\\nMore information regarding SIP security considerations, including registration hijacking, server impersonation, and session teardown, can be found in Section 26 of SIP RFC\\n3261.\\n\\nSIP and NAT\\nProbably the biggest technical hurdle SIP has to conquer is the challenge of carrying\\nout transactions across a NAT layer. Because SIP encapsulates addressing information\\nin its data frames, and NAT happens at a lower network layer, the addressing information is not automatically modified and, thus, the media streams will not have the\\ncorrect addressing information needed to complete the connection when NAT is in\\nplace. In addition to this, the firewalls normally integrated with NAT will not consider\\nthe incoming media stream to be part of the SIP transaction, and will block the connection. Newer firewalls and Session Border Controllers are SIP-aware, but this is still\\n190 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cconsidered a shortcoming in this protocol, and it causes no end of trouble to network\\nprofessionals needing to connect SIP endpoints using existing network infrastructure.\\n\\nThis International Telecommunication Union (ITU) protocol was originally designed\\nto provide an IP transport mechanism for video conferencing. It has become the standard in IP-based video-conferencing equipment, and it briefly enjoyed fame as a VoIP\\nprotocol as well. While there is much heated debate over whether SIP or H.323 (or\\nIAX) will dominate the VoIP protocol world, in Asterisk, H.323 has largely been deprecated in favor of IAX and SIP. H.323 has not enjoyed much success among users and\\nenterprises, although it might still be the most widely used VoIP protocol among carriers.\\nThe three versions of H.323 supported in Asterisk are handled by the modules\\nchan_h323.so (supplied with Asterisk), chan_oh323.so (available as a free add-on), and\\nchan_ooh323.so (supplied in asterisk-addons).\\nYou have probably used H.323 without even knowing it--Microsoft\\'s\\nNetMeeting client is arguably the most widely deployed H.323 client.\\n\\nHistory\\nH.323 was developed by the ITU in May of 1996 as a means to transmit voice, video,\\ndata, and fax communications across an IP-based network while maintaining connectivity with the PSTN. Since that time, H.323 has gone through several versions and\\nannexes (which add functionality to the protocol), allowing it to operate in pure VoIP\\nnetworks and more widely distributed networks.\\n\\nFuture\\nThe future of H.323 is a subject of debate. If the media is any measure, it doesn\\'t look\\ngood for H.323; it hardly ever gets mentioned (certainly not with the regularity of SIP).\\nH.323 is often regarded as technically superior to SIP, but, as with so many other technologies, that sort of thing is seldom the deciding factor in whether technology enjoys\\nsuccess. One of the factors that makes H.323 unpopular is its complexity--although\\nmany argue that the once-simple SIP is starting to suffer from the same problem.\\nH.323 still carries by far the majority of worldwide carrier VoIP traffic, but as people\\nbecome less and less dependent on traditional carriers for their telecom needs, the\\nfuture of H.323 becomes more difficult to predict with any certainty. While H.323 may\\nnot be the protocol of choice for new implementations, we can certainly expect to have\\nto deal with H.323 interoperability issues for some time to come.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 191\\n\\x0cSecurity considerations\\nH.323 is a relatively secure protocol and does not require many security considerations\\nbeyond those that are common to any network communicating with the Internet. Since\\nH.323 uses the RTP protocol for media communications, it does not natively support\\nencrypted media paths. The use of a VPN or other encrypted tunnel between endpoints\\nis the most common way of securely encapsulating communications. Of course, this\\nhas the disadvantage of requiring the establishment of these secure tunnels between\\nendpoints, which may not always be convenient (or even possible). As VoIP becomes\\nused more often to communicate with financial institutions such as banks, we\\'re likely\\nto require extensions to the most commonly used VoIP protocols to natively support\\nstrong encryption methods.\\n\\nH.323 and NAT\\nThe H.323 standard uses the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RTP protocol to\\ntransport media between endpoints. Because of this, H.323 has the same issues as SIP\\nwhen dealing with network topologies involving NAT. The easiest method is to simply\\nforward the appropriate ports through your NAT device to the internal client.\\nTo receive calls, you will always need to forward TCP port 1720 to the client. In addition, you will need to forward the UDP ports for the RTP media and RTCP control\\nstreams (see the manual for your device for the port range it requires). Older clients,\\nsuch as Microsoft NetMeeting, will also require TCP ports forwarded for H.245 tunneling (again, see your client\\'s manual for the port number range).\\nIf you have a number of clients behind the NAT device, you will need to use a\\ngatekeeper running in proxy mode. The gatekeeper will require an interface attached\\nto the private IP subnet and the public Internet. Your H.323 client on the private IP\\nsubnet will then register to the gatekeeper, which will proxy calls on the clients\\' behalf.\\nNote that any external clients that wish to call you will also be required to register with\\nthe proxy server.\\nAt this time, Asterisk can\\'t act as an H.323 gatekeeper. You\\'ll have to use a separate\\napplication, such as the open source OpenH323 Gatekeeper (http://www.gnugk.org).\\n\\nMGCP\\nThe Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) also comes to us from the IETF. While\\nMGCP deployment is more widespread than one might think, it is quickly losing\\nground to protocols such as SIP and IAX. Still, Asterisk loves protocols, so naturally it\\nhas rudimentary support for it.\\nMGCP is defined in RFC 3435.* It was designed to make the end devices (such as\\nphones) as simple as possible, and have all the call logic and processing handled by\\n* RFC 3435 obsoletes RFC 2705.\\n\\n192 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cmedia gateways and call agents. Unlike SIP, MGCP uses a centralized model. MGCP\\nphones cannot directly call other MGCP phones; they must always go through some\\ntype of controller.\\nAsterisk supports MGCP through the chan_mgcp.so module, and the endpoints are\\ndefined in the configuration file mgcp.conf. Since Asterisk provides only basic call agent\\nservices, it cannot emulate an MGCP phone (to register to another MGCP controller\\nas a user agent, for example).\\nIf you have some MGCP phones lying around, you will be able to use them with Asterisk. If you are planning to put MGCP phones into production on an Asterisk system,\\nkeep in mind that the community has moved on to more popular protocols, and you\\nwill therefore need to budget your software support needs accordingly. If possible (for\\nexample, with Cisco phones), you should upgrade MGCP phones to SIP.\\n\\nProprietary Protocols\\nFinally, let\\'s take a look at two proprietary protocols that are supported in Asterisk.\\n\\nSkinny/SCCP\\nThe Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) is proprietary to Cisco VoIP equipment. It\\nis the default protocol for endpoints on a Cisco Call Manager PBX. Skinny is supported\\nin Asterisk, but if you are connecting Cisco phones to Asterisk, it is generally recommended that you obtain SIP images for any phones that support it and connect via SIP\\ninstead.\\n\\nUNISTIM\\nSupport for Nortel\\'s proprietary VoIP protocol, UNISTIM, means that Asterisk is the\\nfirst PBX in history to natively support proprietary IP terminals from the two biggest\\nplayers in VoIP--Nortel and Cisco. UNISTIM support is totally experimental, and does\\nnot work well enough to put into production, but the fact that somebody took the\\ntrouble to do this demonstrates the power of the Asterisk platform.\\n\\nCodecs\\nCodecs are generally understood to be various mathematical models used to digitally\\nencode (and compress) analog audio information. Many of these models take into account the human brain\\'s ability to form an impression from incomplete information.\\nWe\\'ve all seen optical illusions; likewise, voice-compression algorithms take advantage\\nof our tendency to interpret what we believe we should hear, rather than what we\\n\\n Cisco has recently announced that it will be migrating toward SIP in its future products.\\n\\nCodecs | 193\\n\\x0cactually hear. The purpose of the various encoding algorithms is to strike a balance\\nbetween efficiency and quality.\\nOriginally, the term codec referred to a COder/DECoder: a device that converts between\\nanalog and digital. Now, the term seems to relate more to COmpression/\\nDECompression.\\nBefore we dig into the individual codecs, take a look at Table 8-1--it\\'s a quick reference\\nthat you may want to refer back to.\\nTable 8-1.

In fact, if someone refers to PCM (discussed in the previous chapter) with respect to a telephone network, you are allowed\\nto think of G.711. Two companding methods are used: law in North America and\\nalaw in the rest of the world. Either one delivers an 8-bit word transmitted 8,000 times\\nper second. If you do the math, you will see that this requires 64,000 bits to be transmitted per second.\\nMany people will tell you that G.711 is an uncompressed codec. This is not exactly\\ntrue, as companding is considered a form of compression. What is true is that G.711\\nis the base codec from which all of the others are derived.\\nG.711 imposes minimal (almost zero) load on the CPU.\\n\\n \"Aoccdrnig to rsereach at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn\\'t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the\\n\\nolny iprmoetnt tihng is taht frist and lsat ltteres are in the rghit pclae.

We do\\nthe same thing with soundif there is enough information, our brain can fill in the gaps.\\n On an audio CD, quality is far more important than saving bandwidth, so the audio is quantized at 16 bits\\n\\n(times 2, as it\\'s stereo), with a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz. Considering that the CD was invented in the late\\n1970s, this was quite impressive stuff back then. The telephone network does not require this level of quality\\n(and needs to optimize bandwidth), so telephone signals are encoded using 8 bits, at a sampling frequency\\nof 8,000 Hz.\\n\\n194 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cThis codec has been around for some time (it used to be G.721, which is now obsolete),\\nand it is one of the original compressed codecs. It is also known as Adaptive Differential\\nPulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM), and it can run at several bitrates. The most common rates are 16 Kbps, 24 Kbps, and 32 Kbps. As of this writing, Asterisk currently\\nsupports only the ADPCM-32 rate, which is far and away the most popular rate for this\\ncodec.\\nG.726 offers quality nearly identical to G.711, but it uses only half the bandwidth. This\\nis possible because rather than sending the result of the quantization measurement, it\\nsends only enough information to describe the difference between the current sample\\nand the previous one. G.726 fell from favor in the 1990s due to its inability to carry\\nmodem and fax signals, but because of its bandwidth/CPU performance ratio it is now\\nmaking a comeback. G.726 is especially attractive because it does not require a lot of\\ncomputational work from the system.\\n\\nConsidering how little bandwidth it uses, G.729A delivers impressive sound quality. It\\ndoes this through the use of Conjugate-Structure Algebraic-Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CS-ACELP). Because of patents, you can\\'t use G729A without paying a\\nlicensing fee; however, it is extremely popular and is, thus, well supported on many\\ndifferent phones and systems.\\nTo achieve its impressive compression ratio, this codec requires an equally impressive\\namount of effort from the CPU. In an Asterisk system, the use of heavily compressed\\ncodecs will quickly bog down the CPU.\\nG.729A uses 8 Kbps of bandwidth.\\n\\nGSM\\nGSM is the darling codec of Asterisk. This codec does not come encumbered with a\\nlicensing requirement the way that G.729A does, and it offers outstanding performance\\nwith respect to the demand it places on the CPU. The sound quality is generally considered to be of a lesser grade than that produced by G.729A, but much of this comes\\ndown to personal opinion; be sure to try it out. GSM operates at 13 Kbps.\\n\\n CELP is a popular method of compressing speech. By mathematically modeling the various ways humans\\n\\nmake sounds, a codebook of sounds can be built. Rather than sending an actual sampled sound, a code\\ncorresponding to the sound is determined. CELP codecs take this information (which by itself would produce\\na very robot-like sound) and attempt to add the personality back in. (Of course, there is much more to it than\\nthat.) Jason Woodward\\'s Speech Coding page (http://www-mobile.ecs.soton.ac.uk/speech_codecs/) is a source\\nof helpful information for the non-mathematically inclined. This is fairly heavy stuff, though, so wear your\\nthinking cap.\\n\\nCodecs | 195\\n\\x0ciLBC\\nThe Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC) provides an attractive mix of low bandwidth\\nusage and quality, and it is especially well suited to sustaining reasonable quality on\\nlossy network links.\\nNaturally, Asterisk supports it (and support elsewhere is growing), but it is not as\\npopular as the ITU codecs and, thus, may not be compatible with common IP telephones and commercial VoIP systems. IETF RFCs 3951 and 3952 have been published\\nin support of iLBC, and iLBC is on the IETF standards track.\\nBecause iLBC uses complex algorithms to achieve its high levels of compression, it has\\na fairly high CPU cost in Asterisk.\\nWhile you are allowed to use iLBC without paying royalty fees, the holder of the iLBC\\npatent, Global IP Sound (GIPS), wants to know whenever you use it in a commercial\\napplication. The way you do that is by downloading and printing a copy of the iLBC\\nlicense, signing it, and returning it to GIPS. If you want to read about iLBC and its\\nlicense, you can do so at http://www.ilbcfreeware.org.\\niLBC operates at 13.3 Kbps (30 ms frames) and 15.2 Kbps (20 ms frames).\\n\\nSpeex\\nSpeex is a variable bitrate (VBR) codec, which means that it is able to dynamically\\nmodify its bitrate to respond to changing network conditions. It is offered in both\\nnarrowband and wideband versions, depending on whether you want telephone quality\\nor better.\\nSpeex is a totally free codec, licensed under the Xiph.org variant of the BSD license.\\nAn Internet draft for Speex is available, and more information about Speex can be found\\nat its home page (http://www.speex.org).\\nSpeex can operate at anywhere from 2.15 to 22.4 Kbps, due to its variable bitrate.\\n\\nSure thing, MP3 is a codec. Specifically, it\\'s the Moving Picture Experts Group Audio\\nLayer 3 Encoding Standard.# With a name like that, it\\'s no wonder we call it MP3! In\\nAsterisk, the MP3 codec is typically used for Music on Hold (MoH). MP3 is not a\\ntelephony codec, as it is optimized for music, not voice; nevertheless, it\\'s very popular\\nwith VoIP telephony systems as a method of delivering Music on Hold.\\n\\n# If you want to learn all about MPEG audio, do a web search for Davis Pan\\'s paper titled \"A Tutorial on\\n\\nMPEG/Audio Compression.\"\\n\\n196 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cBe aware that music cannot usually be broadcast without a license.\\nMany people assume that there is no legal problem with connecting a\\nradio station or CD as a Music on Hold source, but this is very rarely\\ntrue.\\n\\nQuality of Service\\nQuality of Service, or QoS as it\\'s more popularly termed, refers to the challenge of\\ndelivering a time-sensitive stream of data across a network that was designed to deliver\\ndata in an ad hoc, best-effort sort of way. Although there is no hard rule, it is generally\\naccepted that if you can deliver the sound produced by the speaker to the listener\\'s ear\\nwithin 150 milliseconds, a normal flow of conversation is possible. When delay exceeds\\n300 milliseconds, it becomes difficult to avoid interrupting each other. Beyond 500\\nmilliseconds, normal conversation becomes increasingly awkward and frustrating.\\nIn addition to getting it there on time, it is also essential to ensure that the transmitted\\ninformation arrives intact. Too many lost packets will prevent the far end from completely reproducing the sampled audio, and gaps in the data will be heard as static or,\\nin severe cases, entire missed words or sentences. Even packet loss of 5 percent can\\nseverely impede a VoIP network.\\n\\nTCP, UDP, and SCTP\\nIf you\\'re going to send data on an IP-based network, it will be transported using one\\nof the three transport protocols discussed here.\\n\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is almost never used for VoIP, for while it\\ndoes have mechanisms in place to ensure delivery, it is not inherently in any hurry to\\ndo so. Unless you have an extremely low-latency interconnection between the two\\nendpoints, TCP will tend to cause more problems than it solves.\\nThe purpose of TCP is to guarantee the delivery of packets. In order to do this, several\\nmechanisms are implemented, such as packet numbering (for reconstructing blocks of\\ndata), delivery acknowledgment, and re-requesting lost packets. In the world of VoIP,\\ngetting the packets to the endpoint quickly is paramount--but 20 years of cellular\\ntelephony has trained us to tolerate a few lost packets.*\\n\\n* The order of arrival is important in voice communication, because the audio will be processed and sent to\\n\\nthe caller ASAP. However, with a jitter buffer the order of arrival isn\\'t as important, as it provides a small\\nwindow of time in which the packets can be reordered before being passed on to the caller.\\n\\nQuality of Service | 197\\n\\x0cTCP\\'s high processing overhead, state management, and acknowledgment of arrival\\nwork well for transmitting large amounts of data, but they simply aren\\'t efficient\\nenough for real-time media communications.\\n\\nUser Datagram Protocol\\nUnlike TCP, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not offer any sort of delivery\\nguarantee. Packets are placed on the wire as quickly as possible and released into the\\nworld to find their way to their final destinations, with no word back as to whether\\nthey got there or not. Since UDP itself does not offer any kind of guarantee that the\\ndata will arrive, it achieves its efficiency by spending very little effort on what it is\\ntransporting.\\nTCP is a more \"socially responsible\" protocol because the bandwidth\\nis more evenly distributed to clients connecting to a server. As the percentage of UDP traffic increases, it is possible that a network could\\nbecome overwhelmed.\\n\\nStream Control Transmission Protocol\\nApproved by the IETF as a proposed standard in RFC 2960, SCTP is a relatively new\\ntransport protocol. From the ground up, it was designed to address the shortcomings\\nof both TCP and UDP, especially as related to the types of services that used to be\\ndelivered over circuit-switched telephony networks.\\nSome of the goals of SCTP were:\\n Better congestion-avoidance techniques (specifically, avoiding Denial of Service\\nattacks)\\n Strict sequencing of data delivery\\n Lower latency for improved real-time transmissions\\nBy overcoming the major shortcomings of TCP and UDP, the SCTP developers hoped\\nto create a robust protocol for the transmission of SS7 and other types of PSTN signaling\\nover an IP-based network.\\n\\nDifferentiated Service\\nDifferentiated service, or DiffServ, is not so much a QoS mechanism as a method by\\nwhich traffic can be flagged and given specific treatment. Obviously, DiffServ can help\\nto provide QoS by allowing certain types of packets to take precedence over others.\\n\\n Keep in mind that the upper-layer protocols or applications can implement their own packet-\\n\\nacknowledgment systems.\\n\\n198 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cWhile this will certainly increase the chance of a VoIP packet passing quickly through\\neach link, it does not guarantee anything.\\n\\nGuaranteed Service\\nThe ultimate guarantee of QoS is provided by the PSTN. For each conversation, a 64\\nKbps channel is completely dedicated to the call; the bandwidth is guaranteed. Similarly, protocols that offer guaranteed service can ensure that a required amount of\\nbandwidth is dedicated to the connection being served. As with any packetized networking technology, these mechanisms generally operate best when traffic is below\\nmaximum levels. When a connection approaches its limits, it is next to impossible to\\neliminate degradation.\\n\\nMPLS\\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for engineering network traffic\\npatterns independent of layer-3 routing tables. The protocol works by assigning short\\nlabels (MPLS frames) to network packets, which routers then use to forward the packets\\nto the MPLS egress router, and ultimately to their final destinations. Traditionally,\\nrouters make an independent forwarding decision based on an IP table lookup at each\\nhop in the network. In an MPLS network, this lookup is performed only once, when\\nthe packet enters the MPLS cloud at the ingress router. The packet is then assigned to\\na stream, referred to as a Label Switched Path (LSP), and identified by a label. The label\\nis used as a lookup index in the MPLS forwarding table, and the packet traverses the\\nLSP independent of layer-3 routing decisions. This allows the administrators of large\\nnetworks to fine-tune routing decisions and make the best use of network resources.\\nAdditionally, information can be associated with a label to prioritize packet forwarding.\\n\\nRSVP\\nMPLS contains no method to dynamically establish LSPs, but you can use the Reservation Protocol (RSVP) with MPLS. RSVP is a signaling protocol used to simplify the\\nestablishment of LSPs and to report problems to the MPLS ingress router. The advantage of using RSVP in conjunction with MPLS is the reduction in administrative\\noverhead. If you don\\'t use RSVP with MPLS, you\\'ll have to go to every single router\\nand configure the labels and each path manually. Using RSVP makes the network more\\ndynamic by distributing control of labels to the routers. This enables the network to\\nbecome more responsive to changing conditions, because it can be set up to change the\\npaths based on certain conditions, such as a certain path going down (perhaps due to\\na faulty router). The configuration within the router will then be able to use RSVP to\\ndistribute new labels to the routers in the MPLS network, with no (or minimal) human\\nintervention.\\n\\nQuality of Service | 199\\n\\x0cBest Effort\\nThe simplest, least expensive approach to QoS is not to provide it at all--the \"best\\neffort\" method. While this might sound like a bad idea, it can in fact work very well.\\nAny VoIP call that traverses the public Internet is almost certain to be best-effort, as\\nQoS mechanisms are not yet common in this environment.\\n\\nEcho\\nYou may not realize it, but echo has been a problem in the PSTN for as long as there\\nhave been telephones. You probably haven\\'t often experienced it, because the telecom\\nindustry has spent large sums of money designing expensive echo cancellation devices.\\nAlso, when the endpoints are physically close--e.g., when you phone your neighbor\\ndown the street--the delay is so minimal that anything you transmit will be returned\\nback so quickly that it will be indistinguishable from the sidetone normally occurring\\nin your telephone. So the fact of the matter is that there is echo on your local calls much\\nof the time, but you cannot perceive it with a regular telephone because it happens\\nalmost instantaneously. It may be helpful to understand this if you consider that when\\nyou stand in a room and speak, everything you say echos back to you off of the walls\\nand ceiling (and possibly floor if it\\'s not carpeted), but does not cause any problems\\nbecause it happens so fast you do not perceive a delay.\\nThe reason that VoIP telephone systems such as Asterisk can experience echo is that\\nthe addition of a VoIP telephone introduces a slight delay. It takes a few milliseconds\\nfor the packets to travel from your phone and the server (and vice versa). Suddenly\\nthere is an appreciable delay, which allows you to perceive the echo that was always\\nthere, but never had a delay before.\\n\\nWhy Echo Occurs\\nBefore we discuss measures to deal with echo, let\\'s first take a look at why echo occurs\\nin the analog world.\\nIf you hear echo, it\\'s not your phone that\\'s causing the problem; it\\'s the far end of the\\ncircuit. Conversely, echo heard on the far end is being generated at your end. Echo can\\nbe caused by the fact that an analog local loop circuit has to transmit and receive on\\nthe same pair of wires. If this circuit is not electrically balanced, or if a low-quality\\ntelephone is connected to the end of the circuit, signals it receives can be reflected back,\\nbecoming part of the return transmission. When this reflected circuit gets back to you,\\nyou will hear the words you spoke just moments before. Humans will perceive an echo\\n\\n As discussed in Chapter 7, sidetone is a function in your telephone that returns part of what you say back to\\n\\nyour own ear, to provide a more natural-sounding conversation.\\n\\n200 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cbeyond a certain amount of delay (possibly as low as 20 milliseconds for some people).\\nThis echo will become annoying as the delay increases.\\nIn a cheap telephone, it is possible for echo to be generated in the body of the handset.\\nThis is why some cheap IP phones can cause echo even when the entire end-to-end\\nconnection does not contain an analog circuit. In the VoIP world, echo is usually\\nintroduced either by an analog circuit somewhere in the connection, or by a cheap\\nendpoint reflecting back some of the signal (e.g., feedback through a hands-free or\\npoorly designed handset or headset). The greater the latency on the network, the more\\nannoying this echo can be.\\n\\nManaging Echo on Zaptel Channels\\nIn the zconfig.h configuration file, you can choose from one of several echo-canceller\\nalgorithms, with the default being MARK2. Experiment with the various echo cancellers on your network to determine the best one for your environment. Asterisk also has\\nan option in the zconfig.h file to make the echo cancellation more aggressive. You can\\nenable it by uncommenting the following line:\\n#define AGGRESSIVE_SUPPRESSOR\\n\\nNote that aggressive echo cancellation can create a walkie-talkie, half-duplex effect. It\\nshould be enabled only if all other methods of reducing echo have failed.\\nEnable echo cancellation for Zaptel interfaces in the zapata.conf file. The default configuration enables echo cancellation with echocancel=yes. echocancelwhenbridged=yes\\nwill enable echo cancellation for TDM bridged calls. While bridged calls should not\\nrequire echo cancellation, this may improve call quality.\\nWhen echo cancellation is enabled, the echo canceller learns of echo on the line by\\nlistening for it for the duration of the call. Consequently, echo may be heard at the\\nbeginning of a call and eventually lessen after a period of time. To avoid this situation,\\nyou can employ a method called echo training, which will mute the line briefly at the\\nbeginning of a call, and then send a tone from which the amount of echo on the line\\ncan be determined. This allows Asterisk to deal with the echo more quickly. Echo\\ntraining can be enabled with echotraining=yes.\\n\\nHardware Echo Cancellation\\nThe most effective way to handle echo cancellation is not in software. If you are planning on deploying a good quality system, spend the extra money and purchase cards\\nfor the system that have onboard hardware echo cancellation. These cards are somewhat more expensive, but they quickly pay for themselves in terms of reduced load on\\nthe CPU, as well as reduced load on you due to less user complaints.\\n\\n Actually, the handset in any phone, be it traditional or VoIP, is an analog connection.\\n\\nEcho | 201\\n\\x0cAsterisk and VoIP\\nIt should come as no surprise that Asterisk loves to talk VoIP. But in order to do so,\\nAsterisk needs to know which function it is to perform: that of client, server, or both.\\nOne of the most complex and often confusing concepts in Asterisk is the naming\\nscheme of inbound and outbound authentication.\\n\\nUsers and Peers and Friends--Oh My!\\nConnections that authenticate to us, or that we authenticate, are defined in the\\niax.conf and sip.conf files as users and peers. Connections that do both may be defined\\nas friends. When determining which way the authentication is occurring, it is always\\nimportant to view the direction of the channels from Asterisk\\'s viewpoint, as connections are being accepted and created by the Asterisk server.\\n\\nUsers\\nA connection defined as a user is any system/user/endpoint that we allow to connect\\nto us. Keep in mind that a user definition does not provide a method with which to call\\nthat user; the user type is used simply to create a channel for incoming calls. A user\\ndefinition will require a context name to be defined to indicate where the incoming\\nauthenticated call will enter the dialplan (in extensions.conf).\\n\\nPeers\\nA connection defined as a peer type is an outgoing connection. Think of it this way:\\nusers place calls to us, while we place calls to our peers. Since peers do not place calls\\nto us, a peer definition does not typically require the configuration of a context name.\\nHowever, there is one exception: if calls that originate from your system are returned\\nto your system in a loopback, the incoming calls (which originate from a SIP proxy,\\nnot a user agent) will be matched on the peer definition. The default context should\\nhandle these incoming calls appropriately, although it\\'s preferable for contexts to be\\ndefined for them on a per-peer basis.#\\nIn order to know where to send a call to a host, we must know its location in relation\\nto the Internet (that is, its IP address). The location of a peer may be defined either\\nstatically or dynamically. A dynamic peer is configured with host=dynamic under the\\npeer definition heading. Because the IP address of a dynamic peer may change\\n\\n In SIP, this is not always the case. If the endpoint is a SIP proxy service (as opposed to a user agent), Asterisk\\n\\nwill authenticate based on the peer definition, matching the IP address and port in the Contact field of the\\nSIP header against the hostname (and port, if specified) defined for the peer (if the port is not specified, the\\none defined in the [general] section will be used). See the discussion of the SIP insecure option in\\nAppendix A for more on this subject.\\n# For more information on this topic, see the discussion of the SIP context option in Appendix A.\\n\\n202 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\n\\nUser\\n\\nAsterisk\\n\\nPeer\\n\\nAsterisk\\n\\nFriend\\n\\nFigure 8-2. Call origination relationships of users, peers, and friends to Asterisk\\n\\nconstantly, it must register with the Asterisk box to let it know what its IP address is,\\nso calls can successfully be routed to it. If the remote end is another Asterisk box, the\\nuse of a register statement is required, as discussed below.\\n\\nFriends\\nDefining a type as a friend is a shortcut for defining it as both a user and a peer.\\nHowever, connections that are both a user and a peer aren\\'t always defined this way,\\nbecause defining each direction of call creation individually (using both a user and a\\npeer definition) allows more granularity and control over the individual connections.\\nFigure 8-2 shows the flow of authentication control in relation to Asterisk.\\n\\nregister Statements\\nA register statement is a way of telling a remote peer where your Asterisk box is in\\nrelation to the Internet. Asterisk uses register statements to authenticate to remote\\nproviders when you are employing a dynamic IP address, or when the provider does\\nnot have your IP address on record. There are situations when a register statement is\\nnot required, but to demonstrate when a register statement is required, let\\'s look at\\nan example.\\nSay you have a remote peer that is providing DID services to you. When someone calls\\nthe number +1-800-555-1212, the call goes over the physical PSTN network to your\\nservice provider and into its Asterisk server, possibly over its T1 connection. This call\\nis then routed to your Asterisk server via the Internet.\\n\\nAsterisk and VoIP | 203\\n\\x0cYour service provider will have a definition in either its sip.conf or iax.conf configuration\\nfile (depending on whether you are connecting with the SIP or IAX protocol, respectively) for your Asterisk server. If you receive calls only from this provider, you would\\ndefine them as a user (if it was another Asterisk system, you might be defined in its\\nsystem as a peer).\\nNow let\\'s say that your box is on your home Internet connection, with a dynamic IP\\naddress. Your service provider has a static IP address (or perhaps a fully qualified domain name), which you place in your configuration file. Since you have a dynamic\\naddress, your service provider specifies host=dynamic in its configuration file. In order\\nto know where to route your +1-800-555-1212 call, your service provider needs to know\\nwhere you are located in relation to the Internet. This is where the register statement\\ncomes into use.\\nThe register statement is a way of authenticating and telling your peer where you are.\\nIn the [general] section of your configuration file, you place a statement similar to this:\\nregister => username:secret@my_remote_peer\\n\\nYou can verify a successful register with the use of the iax2 show registry and sip show\\nregistry commands at the Asterisk console.\\n\\nVoIP Security\\nIn this book we can barely scratch the surface of the complex matter of VoIP security;\\ntherefore before we dig in, we want to steer you in the direction of the VoIP Security\\nAlliance (http://www.voipsa.org). This fantastic resource contains an excellent mailing\\nlist, white papers, howtos, and a general compendium of all matters relating to VoIP\\nsecurity. Just as email has been abused by the selfish and criminal, so too will voice.\\nThe fine folks at VoIPSA are doing what they can to ensure that we address these\\nchallenges now, before they become an epidemic. In the realm of books on the subject,\\nwe recommend the most excellent Hacking Exposed VoIP by David Endler and Mark\\nCollier (McGraw-Hill Osborne Media). If you are responsible for deploying any VoIP\\nsystem, you need to be aware of this stuff.\\n\\nSpam over Internet Telephony (SPIT)\\nWe don\\'t want to think about this, but we know it\\'s coming. The simple fact is that\\nthere are people in this world who lack certain social skills, and, coupled with a kind\\nof mindless greed, these folks think nothing of flooding the Internet with massive volumes of email. These same types of characters will similarly think little of doing the\\nsame with voice. We already know what it\\'s like to get flooded with telemarketing calls;\\ntry to imagine what happens when it costs the telemarketer almost nothing to send\\nvoice spam. Regulation has not stopped email spam, and it will probably not stop voice\\nspam, so it will be up to us to prevent it.\\n\\n204 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cEncrypting Audio with Secure RTP\\nIf you can sniff the packets coming out of an Asterisk system, you can extract the audio\\nfrom the RTP streams. This data can be fed offline to a speech processing system, which\\ncan listen for keywords such as \"credit card number\" or \"PIN\", and present that data\\nto someone who has an interest in it. The stream can also be evaluated to see if there\\nare DTMF tones embedded in it, which is dangerous because many services ask for\\npassword and credit card information input via the dialpad. In business, strategic information could also be gleaned from being able to capture and evaluate audio.\\nUsing Secure RTP can combat this problem by encrypting the RTP streams; however,\\nAsterisk does not support SRTP as of this writing. Work is under way to provide SRTP\\nsupport (a patch exists in the trunk release, but it is not known as of this writing whether\\nthis will be back-ported to 1.4).\\n\\nSpoofing\\nIn the traditional telephone network, it is very difficult to successfully adopt someone\\nelse\\'s identity. Your activities can (and will) be traced back to you, and the authorities\\nwill quickly put an end to the fun. In the world of IP, it is much easier to remain\\nanonymous. As such, it is no stretch to imagine that hordes of enterprising criminals\\nwill only be too happy to make calls to your credit card company or bank, pretending\\nto be you. If a trusted mechanism is not discovered to combat spoofing, we will quickly\\nlearn that we cannot trust VoIP calls.\\n\\nWhat Can Be Done?\\nThe first thing to keep in mind when considering security on a VoIP system is that VoIP\\nis based on network protocols, and needs be evaluated from that perspective. This is\\nnot to say that traditional telecom security should be ignored, but we need to pay\\nattention to the underlying network.\\n\\nBasic network security\\nOne of the most effective things that can be done is to secure access to the voice network.\\nThe use of firewalls and VLANs are examples of how this can be achieved. By default,\\nthe voice network should be accessible only to those things that have a need. For example, if you do not have any softphones in use, do not allow client PCs access to the\\nvoice network.\\nSegregating voice and data traffic. Unless there is a need to have voice and data on the same\\nnetwork, there may be some value in keeping them separate (this can have other benefits\\nas well, such as simplifying QoS configurations). It is not unheard of to build the internal voice network on a totally separate LAN, using existing CAT3 cabling and\\nterminating on inexpensive network switches. It can be less expensive too.\\n\\nVoIP Security | 205\\n\\x0cDMZ. Placing your VoIP system in a DMZ can provide an additional layer of protection\\nfor your LAN, while still allowing connectivity for relevant applications. Should your\\nVoIP system be compromised, it will be much more difficult to use it to launch an attack\\non the rest of your network, since it is not trusted. Regardless of whether you deploy\\nwithin a DMZ, any abnormal traffic coming out of the system should be suspect.\\nServer hardening. Hardening your Asterisk server is critical. Not only are there performance benefits to doing this (running nonessential processes can eat up valuable CPU\\nand RAM), the elimination of anything not required will reduce the chance that an\\nexploited vulnerability in the operating system can be used to gain access and launch\\nan attack on other parts of your network.\\nRunning Asterisk as non-root is an essential part of system hardening. See Chapter 11 for more information.\\n\\nEncryption\\nEven though Asterisk does not yet fully support SRTP, it is still possible to encrypt VoIP\\ntraffic. For example, between sites a VPN could be employed. Consideration should\\nbe given to the performance cost of this, but in general this can be a very effective way\\nto secure VoIP traffic and it is relatively simple to implement.\\n\\nPhysical security\\nPhysical security should not be ignored. All terminating equipment (such as switches,\\nrouters, and the PBX itself) should be secured in an environment that can only be\\naccessed by authorized persons. At the user end (such as under desks), it can be more\\ndifficult to deliver physical security, but if the network responds only to devices that it\\nis familiar with (such as restricting DHCP to devices whose MAC is known), unauthorized intrusion can be mitigated somewhat.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf you listen to the buzz in the telecom industry, you might think that VoIP is the future\\nof telephony. But to Asterisk, VoIP is more a case of \"been there, done that.\" For Asterisk, the future of telephony is much more exciting. We\\'ll take a look at that vision a\\nbit later, in Chapter 15. In the next chapter, we are going to delve into one of the more\\nrevolutionary and powerful concepts of Asterisk: AGI, the Asterisk Gateway Interface.\\n\\n206 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0c\\nThe Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\nEven he, to whom most things that most people would\\nthink were pretty smart were pretty dumb, thought it\\nwas pretty smart.\\n--Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt\\n\\nThe Asterisk Gateway Interface, or AGI, provides a standard interface by which external\\nprograms may control the Asterisk dialplan. Usually, AGI scripts are used to do advanced logic, communicate with relational databases (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL),\\nand access other external resources. Turning over control of the dialplan to an external\\nAGI script enables Asterisk to easily perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or\\nimpossible.\\nThis chapter covers the fundamentals of AGI communication. It will not teach you how\\nto be a programmer--rather, we\\'ll assume that you\\'re already a competent programmer, so that we can show you how to write AGI programs. If you don\\'t know how to\\ndo computer programming, this chapter probably isn\\'t for you, and you should skip\\nahead to the next chapter.\\nOver the course of this chapter, we\\'ll write a sample AGI program in each of the Perl,\\nPHP, and Python programming languages. Note, however, that because Asterisk provides a standard interface for AGI scripts, these scripts can be written in almost any\\nmodern programming language. We\\'ve chosen to highlight Perl, PHP, and Python because they\\'re the languages most commonly used for AGI programming.\\n\\nFundamentals of AGI Communication\\nInstead of releasing an API for programming, AGI scripts communicate with Asterisk\\nover communications channels (file handles, in programming parlance) known as\\nSTDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. Most computer programmers will recognize these channels,\\nbut just in case you\\'re not familiar with them, we\\'ll cover them here.\\n\\n\\x0cWhat Are STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR?\\nSTDIN , STDOUT , and STDERR are channels by which programs in Unix-like environments\\nreceive information from and send information to external programs. STDIN, or\\nstandard input, is the information that is sent to the program, either from the keyboard\\nor from another program. In our case, information coming from Asterisk itself comes\\nin on the program\\'s STDIN file handle. STDOUT, or standard output, is the file handle that\\nthe AGI script uses to pass information back to Asterisk. Finally, the AGI script can\\nuse the STDERR (standard error) file handle to write error messages to the Asterisk\\nconsole.\\n\\nLet\\'s sum up these three communications concepts:\\n An AGI script reads from STDIN to get information from Asterisk.\\n An AGI script writes data to STDOUT to send information to Asterisk.\\n An AGI script may write data to STDERR to send debug information to the Asterisk\\nconsole.\\nAt this time, writing to STDERR from within your AGI script writes the\\ninformation only to the first Asterisk console--that is, the first Asterisk\\nconsole started with the -c parameters.\\nThis is rather unfortunate, and will hopefully be remedied soon by the\\nAsterisk developers.\\nIf you\\'re using the safe_asterisk program to start Asterisk (which you\\nprobably are), it starts a remote console on TTY9. (Try pressing CtrlAlt-F9, and see if you get an Asterisk command-line interface.) This\\nmeans that all of the AGI debug information will print on only that\\nremote console. You may want to disable this console in safe_asterisk\\nto allow you to see the debug information in another console. (You may\\nalso want to disable that console for security reasons, as you might not\\nwant just anyone to be able to walk up to your Asterisk server and have\\naccess to a console without any kind of authentication.)\\n\\nThe Standard Pattern of AGI Communication\\nThe communication between Asterisk and an AGI script follows a predefined pattern.\\nLet\\'s enumerate the steps, and then we\\'ll walk through one of the sample AGI scripts\\nthat come with Asterisk.\\nWhen an AGI script starts, Asterisk sends a list of variables and their values to the AGI\\nscript. The variables might look something like this:\\nagi_request: test.py\\nagi_language: en\\nagi_callerid:\\nagi_context: default\\n\\n208 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0c\\nAfter sending these variables, Asterisk sends a blank line. This is the signal that Asterisk\\nis done sending the variables, and it is time for the AGI script to control the dialplan.\\nAt this point, the AGI script sends commands to Asterisk by writing to STDOUT. After\\nthe script sends each command, Asterisk sends a response that the AGI script should\\nread. These actions (sending commands to Asterisk and reading the responses) can\\ncontinue for the duration of the AGI script.\\nYou may be asking yourself what commands you can use from within your AGI script.\\nGood question--we\\'ll cover the basic commands shortly.*\\n\\nCalling an AGI Script from the Dialplan\\nIn order to work properly, your AGI script must be executable. To use an AGI script\\ninside your dialplan, simply call the AGI() application, with the name of the AGI script\\nas the argument, like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,AGI(agi-test.agi)\\n\\nAGI scripts often reside in the AGI directory (usually located\\nin /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin), but you can specify the complete path to the AGI script.\\n\\nAGI(), EAGI(), DeadAGI(), and FastAGI()\\nIn addition to the AGI() application, there are several other AGI applications suited to\\ndifferent circumstances. While they won\\'t be covered in this chapter, they should be\\nquite simple to figure out once you understand the basics of AGI scripting.\\nThe EAGI() (enhanced AGI) application acts just like AGI() but allows your AGI script\\nto read the inbound audio stream on file descriptor number three.\\nThe DeadAGI() application is also just like AGI(), but it works correctly on a channel\\nthat is dead (i.e., a channel that has been hung up). As this implies, the regular AGI()\\napplication doesn\\'t work on dead channels.\\nThe FastAGI() application allows the AGI script to be called across the network, so that\\nmultiple Asterisk servers can call AGI scripts from a central location.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ll first cover the sample agi-test.agi script that comes with Asterisk\\n(which was written in Perl), then write a weather report AGI program in PHP, and finish\\nup by writing an AGI program in Python to play a math game.\\n* To get a list of available AGI commands, type show agi at the Asterisk command-line interface. You can also\\n\\nrefer to Appendix C for an AGI command reference.\\n\\nFundamentals of AGI Communication | 209\\n\\x0cWriting AGI Scripts in Perl\\nAsterisk comes with a sample AGI script called agi-test.agi. Let\\'s step through the file\\nwhile we cover the core concepts of AGI programming. While this particular script is\\nwritten in Perl, please remember that your own AGI programs may be written in almost\\nany programming language. Just to prove it, we\\'re going to cover AGI programming in\\na couple of other languages later in the chapter.\\nLet\\'s get started! We\\'ll look at each section of the code in turn, and describe what it\\ndoes:\\n#!/usr/bin/perl\\n\\nThis line tells the system that this particular script is written in Perl, so it should use\\nthe Perl interpreter to execute the script. If you\\'ve done much Linux or Unix scripting,\\nthis line should be familiar to you. This line assumes, of course, that your Perl binary\\nis located in the /usr/bin/ directory. Change this to match the location of your Perl\\ninterpreter.\\nuse strict;\\n\\nuse strict tells Perl to act, well, strict about possible programming errors, such as\\n\\nundeclared variables. While not absolutely necessary, enabling this will help you avoid\\ncommon programming pitfalls.\\n\\nThis line tells Perl not to buffer its output--in other words, that it should write any\\ndata immediately, instead of waiting for a block of data before outputting it. You\\'ll see\\nthis as a recurring theme throughout the chapter.\\n# Set up some variables\\nmy %AGI; my $tests = 0; my $fail = 0; my $pass = 0;\\n\\nYou should always use unbuffered output when writing AGI scripts.\\nOtherwise, your AGI may not work as expected, because Asterisk may\\nbe waiting for the output of your program, while your program thinks\\nit has sent the output to Asterisk and is waiting for a response.\\n\\nHere, we set up four variables. The first is a hash called AGI, which is used to store the\\nvariables that Asterisk passes to our script at the beginning of the AGI session. The next\\nthree are scalar values, used to count the total number of tests, the number of failed\\ntests, and the number of passed tests, respectively.\\nwhile(<STDIN>) {\\nchomp;\\nlast unless length($_);\\nif (/^agi_(\\\\w+)\\\\:\\\\s+(.*)$/) {\\n}\\n}\\n\\n210 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cAs we explained earlier, Asterisk sends a group of variables to the AGI program at\\nstartup. This loop simply takes all of these variables and stores them in the hash named\\nAGI. They can be used later in the program or simply ignored, but they should always\\nbe read from STDIN before continuing on with the logic of the program.\\nprint STDERR \"AGI Environment Dump:\\\\n\";\\nforeach my $i (sort keys %AGI) {\\nprint STDERR \" -- $i = $AGI{$i}\\\\n\";\\n}\\n\\nThis loop simply writes each of the values that we stored in the AGI hash to STDERR. This\\nis useful for debugging the AGI script, as STDERR is printed to the Asterisk console.\\nsub checkresult {\\nmy ($res) = @_;\\nmy $retval;\\n$tests++;\\nchomp $res;\\nif ($res =~ /^200/) {\\n$res =~ /result=(-?\\\\d+)/;\\nif (!length($1)) {\\nprint STDERR \"FAIL ($res)\\\\n\";\\n$fail++;\\n} else {\\nprint STDERR \"PASS ($1)\\\\n\";\\n$pass++;\\n}\\n} else {\\nprint STDERR \"FAIL (unexpected result \\'$res\\')\\\\n\";\\n$fail++;\\n}\\n\\nThis subroutine reads in the result of an AGI command from Asterisk and decodes the\\nresult to determine whether the command passes or fails.\\nNow that the preliminaries are out of the way, we can get to the core logic of the AGI\\nscript:\\nprint STDERR \"1. Testing \\'sendfile\\'...\";\\nprint \"STREAM FILE beep \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis first test shows how to use the STREAM FILE command. The STREAM FILE command\\ntells Asterisk to play a sound file to the caller, just as the Background() application does.\\nIn this case, we\\'re telling Asterisk to play a file called beep.gsm.\\n\\n Actually, to the first spawned Asterisk console (i.e., the first instance of Asterisk called with the -c option).\\n\\nIf safe_asterisk was used to start Asterisk, the first Asterisk console will be on TTY9, which means that you\\nwill not be able to view AGI errors remotely.\\n Asterisk automatically selects the best format, based on translation cost and availability, so the file extension\\n\\nis never used in the function.\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Perl | 211\\n\\x0cYou will notice that the second argument is passed by putting in a set of double quotes,\\nescaped by backslashes. Without the double quotes to indicate the second argument,\\nthis command does not work correctly.\\nYou must pass all required arguments to the AGI commands. If you want\\nto skip a required argument, you must send empty quotes (properly\\nescaped in your particular programming language), as shown above. If\\nyou don\\'t pass the required number of arguments, your AGI script will\\nnot work.\\nYou should also make sure you pass a line feed (the \\\\n on the end of the\\nprint statement) at the end of the command.\\n\\nAfter sending the STREAM FILE command, this test reads the result from STDIN and calls\\nthe checkresult subroutine to determine if Asterisk was able to play the file. The STREAM\\nFILE command takes three arguments, two of which are required:\\n The name of the sound file to play back\\n The digits that may interrupt the playback\\n The position at which to start playing the sound, specified in number of samples\\n(optional)\\nIn short, this test told Asterisk to play back the file named beep.gsm, and then it checked\\nthe result to make sure the command was successfully executed by Asterisk.\\nprint STDERR \"2. Testing \\'sendtext\\'...\";\\nprint \"SEND TEXT \\\\\"hello world\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test shows us how to call the SEND TEXT command, which is similar to the\\nSendText() application. This command will send the specified text to the caller, if the\\ncaller\\'s channel type supports the sending of text.\\nThe SEND TEXT command takes one argument: the text to send to the channel. If the\\ntext contains spaces (as in the previous code block), the argument should be encapsulated with quotes, so that Asterisk will know that the entire text string is a single\\nargument to the command. Again, notice that the quotation marks are escaped, as they\\nmust be sent to Asterisk, not used to terminate the string in Perl.\\nprint STDERR \"3. Testing \\'sendimage\\'...\";\\nprint \"SEND IMAGE asterisk-image\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test calls the SEND IMAGE command, which is similar to the SendImage() application.\\nIts single argument is the name of an image file to send to the caller. As with the SEND\\nTEXT command, this command works only if the calling channel supports the receiving\\nimages.\\n\\n212 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cprint STDERR \"4. Testing \\'saynumber\\'...\";\\nprint \"SAY NUMBER 192837465 \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test sends Asterisk the SAY NUMBER command. This command behaves identically\\nto the SayNumber() dialplan application. It takes two arguments:\\n The number to say\\n The digits that may interrupt the command\\nAgain, since we\\'re not passing in any digits as the second argument, we need to pass\\nin an empty set of quotes.\\nprint STDERR \"5. Testing \\'waitdtmf\\'...\";\\nprint \"WAIT FOR DIGIT 1000\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test shows the WAIT FOR DIGIT command. This command waits the specified number of milliseconds for the caller to enter a DTMF digit. If you want the command to\\nwait indefinitely for a digit, use -1 as the timeout. This application returns the decimal\\nASCII value of the digit that was pressed.\\nprint STDERR \"6. Testing \\'record\\'...\";\\nprint \"RECORD FILE testagi gsm 1234 3000\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis section of code shows us the RECORD FILE command. This command is used to\\nrecord the call audio, similar to the Record() dialplan application. RECORD FILE takes\\nseven arguments, the last three of which are optional:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe filename of the recorded file.\\nThe format in which to record the audio.\\nThe digits that may interrupt the recording.\\nThe timeout (maximum recording time) in milliseconds, or -1 for no timeout.\\nThe number of samples to skip before starting the recording (optional).\\nThe word BEEP, if you\\'d like Asterisk to beep before the recording starts (optional).\\nThe number of seconds before Asterisk decides that the user is done with the recording and returns, even though the timeout hasn\\'t been reached and no DTMF\\ndigits have been entered (optional). This argument must be preceded by s=.\\n\\nIn this particular case, we\\'re recording a file called testagi (in the GSM format), with\\nany of the DTMF digits 1 through 4 terminating the recording, and a maximum recording time of 3,000 milliseconds.\\nprint STDERR \"6a. Testing \\'record\\' playback...\";\\nprint \"STREAM FILE testagi \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Perl | 213\\n\\x0cmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThe second part of this test plays back the audio that was recorded earlier, using the\\nSTREAM FILE command. We\\'ve already covered STREAM FILE, so this section of code\\nneeds no further explanation.\\nprint STDERR \"================== Complete ======================\\\\n\";\\nprint STDERR \"$tests tests completed, $pass passed, $fail failed\\\\n\";\\nprint STDERR \"==================================================\\\\n\";\\n\\nAt the end of the AGI script, a summary of the tests is printed to STDERR, which should\\nend up on the Asterisk console.\\nIn summary, you should remember the following when writing AGI programs in Perl:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurn on strict language checking with the use strict command.\\nTurn off output buffering by setting $|=1.\\nData from Asterisk is received using a while(<STDIN>) loop.\\nWrite values with the print command.\\nUse the print STDERR command to write debug information to the Asterisk console.\\n\\nThe Perl AGI Library\\nIf you are interested in building your own AGI scripts in Perl, you may want to check\\nout the Asterisk::AGI Perl module written by James Golovich, which is located at http://\\nasterisk.gnuinter.net. The Asterisk::AGI module makes it even easier to write AGI\\nscripts in Perl.\\n\\nCreating AGI Scripts in PHP\\nWe promised we\\'d cover several languages, so let\\'s go ahead and see what an AGI script\\nin PHP looks like. The fundamentals of AGI programming still apply; only the programming language has changed. In this example, we\\'ll write an AGI script to download\\na weather report from the Internet and deliver the temperature, wind direction, and\\nwind speed back to the caller:\\n#!/usr/bin/php -q\\n<?php\\n\\nThe first line tells the system to use the PHP interpreter to run this script. The -q option\\nturns off HTML error messages. You should ensure that there aren\\'t any extra lines\\nbetween the first line and the opening PHP tag, as they\\'ll confuse Asterisk.\\n# change this to match the code of your particular city\\n# for a complete list of U.S. cities, go to\\n\\n This advice probably applies to any Perl program you might write, especially if you\\'re new to Perl.\\n\\n214 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0c# http://www.nws.noaa.gov/data/current_obs/\\n$weatherURL=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/data/current_obs/KMDQ.xml\";\\n\\nThis tells our AGI script where to go to get the current weather conditions. In this\\nexample, we\\'re getting the weather for Huntsville, Alabama. Feel free to visit the web\\nsite listed above for a complete list of stations throughout the United States of America.\\n# don\\'t let this script run for more than 60 seconds\\n\\nHere, we tell PHP not to let this program run for more than 60 seconds. This is a safety\\nnet, which will end the script if for some reason it takes more than 60 seconds to run.\\n# turn off output buffering\\nob_implicit_flush(false);\\n\\nThis command turns off output buffering, meaning that all data will be sent immediately to the AGI interface and will not be buffered.\\n# turn off error reporting, as it will most likely interfere with\\n# the AGI interface\\n\\nThis command turns off all error reporting, as it can interfere with the AGI interface.\\n(You might find it helpful to comment out this line during testing.)\\n# create file handles if needed\\nif (!defined(\\'STDIN\\'))\\n{\\ndefine(\\'STDIN\\', fopen(\\'php://stdin\\', \\'r\\'));\\n}\\nif (!defined(\\'STDOUT\\'))\\n{\\ndefine(\\'STDOUT\\', fopen(\\'php://stdout\\', \\'w\\'));\\n}\\nif (!defined(\\'STDERR\\'))\\n{\\ndefine(\\'STDERR\\', fopen(\\'php://stderr\\', \\'w\\'));\\n}\\n\\nThis section of code ensures that we have open file handles for STDIN, STDOUT, and\\nSTDERR, which will handle all communication between Asterisk and our script.\\n# retrieve all AGI variables from Asterisk\\nwhile (!feof(STDIN))\\n{\\n$temp = trim(fgets(STDIN,4096));\\nif (($temp == \"\") || ($temp == \"\\\\n\"))\\n{\\nbreak;\\n}\\n We apologize to our readers outside of the United States for using a weather service that only works for U.S.\\n\\ncities. If you can find a good international weather service that provides its data in XML, it shouldn\\'t be too\\nhard to change this AGI script to work with that particular service. Once we find one, we\\'ll update this script\\nfor future editions.\\n\\nCreating AGI Scripts in PHP | 215\\n\\x0c$s = split(\":\",$temp);\\n$name = str_replace(\"agi_\",\"\",$s[0]);\\n$agi[$name] = trim($s[1]);\\n}\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll read in all of the AGI variables passed to us by Asterisk. Using the fgets\\ncommand in PHP to read the data from STDIN, we\\'ll save each variable in the hash called\\n$agi. Remember that we could use these variables in the logic of our AGI script, although we won\\'t in this example.\\n# print all AGI variables for debugging purposes\\nforeach($agi as $key=>$value)\\n{\\nfwrite(STDERR,\"-- $key = $value\\\\n\");\\nfflush(STDERR);\\n}\\n\\nHere, we print the variables back out to STDERR for debugging purposes.\\n#retrieve this web page\\n$weatherPage=file_get_contents($weatherURL);\\n\\nThis line of code retrieves the XML file from the National Weather Service and puts\\nthe contents into the variable called $weatherPage. This variable will be used later on\\nto extract the pieces of the weather report that we want.\\n#grab temperature in Fahrenheit\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThis section of code extracts the temperature (in Fahrenheit) from the weather report,\\nusing the preg_match command.

This\\nwill be achieved through the use of the STREAM FILE and SAY NUMBER AGI commands.\\nWe\\'ve said it before, and we\\'ll say it again: when calling AGI commands, you must\\npass in all of the required arguments. In this case, both STREAM FILE and SAY NUMBER\\ncommands require a second argument; we\\'ll pass empty quotes escaped by the backslash character.\\nYou should also notice that we call the fflush command each time we write to\\nSTDOUT. While this is arguably redundant, there\\'s no harm in ensuring that the AGI\\ncommand is not buffered and is sent immediately to Asterisk.\\nfunction checkresult($res)\\n{\\ntrim($res);\\n{\\nif (! preg_match(\\'/result=(-?\\\\d+)/\\',$res,$matches))\\n{\\nfwrite(STDERR,\"FAIL ($res)\\\\n\");\\nfflush(STDERR);\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\nfflush(STDERR);\\n\\n218 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0c}\\n}\\nelse\\n{\\nfwrite(STDERR,\"FAIL (unexpected result \\'$res\\')\\\\n\");\\nfflush(STDERR);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe checkresult function is identical in purpose to the checkresult subroutine we saw\\nin our Perl example. As its name suggests, it checks the result that Asterisk returns\\nwhenever we call an AGI command.\\n?>\\n\\nAt the end of the file, we have our closing PHP tag. Don\\'t place any whitespace after\\nthe closing PHP tag, as it can confuse the AGI interface.\\nWe\\'ve now covered two different languages in order to demonstrate the similarities\\nand differences of programming an AGI script in PHP as opposed to Perl. The following\\nthings should be remembered when writing an AGI script in PHP:\\n Invoke PHP with the -q switch; it turns off HTML in error messages.\\n Turn off the time limit, or set it to a reasonable value (newer versions of PHP\\nautomatically disable the time limit when PHP is invoked from the command line).\\n Turn off output buffering with the ob_implicit_flush(false) command.\\n Open file handles to STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR (newer versions of PHP may have\\none or more of these file handles already opened; see the previous code for a slick\\nway of making this work across most versions of PHP).\\n Read variables from STDIN using the fgets function.\\n Use the fwrite function to write to STDOUT and STDERR.\\n Always call the fflush function after writing to either STDOUT or STDERR.\\n\\nThe PHP AGI Library\\nFor advanced AGI programming in PHP, you may want to check out the PHPAGI\\nproject at http://phpagi.sourceforge.net. It was originally written by Matthew Asham\\nand is being developed by several other members of the Asterisk community.\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Python\\nThe AGI script we\\'ll be writing in Python, called \"The Subtraction Game,\" was inspired\\nby a Perl program written by Ed Guy and discussed by him at the 2004 AstriCon conference. Ed described his enthusiasm for the power and simplicity of Asterisk when he\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Python | 219\\n\\x0cfound he could write a quick Perl script to help his young daughter improve her math\\nskills.\\nSince we\\'ve already written a Perl program using AGI, and Ed has already written the\\nmath program in Perl, we figured we\\'d take a stab at it in Python!\\nLet\\'s go through our Python script:\\n#!/usr/bin/python\\n\\nThis line tells the system to run this script in the Python interpreter. For small scripts,\\nyou may consider adding the -u option to this line, which will run Python in unbuffered\\nmode.

This will ensure that your AGI program\\nwon\\'t hang while Asterisk is waiting for the buffer to fill and Python is waiting for\\nthe response from Asterisk.\\n Read data from Asterisk with the sys.stdin.readline command.\\n Write commands to Asterisk with the sys.stdout.write command. Don\\'t forget\\nto call sys.stdout.flush after writing.\\n\\nThe Python AGI Library\\nIf you are planning on writing lot of Python AGI code, you may want to check out Karl\\nPutland\\'s Python module, Pyst. You can find it at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/\\npyst/.\\n\\nDebugging in AGI\\nDebugging AGI programs, as with any other type of program, can be frustrating. Luckily, there are two advantages to debugging AGI scripts. First, since all of the communications between Asterisk and the AGI program happen over STDIN and STDOUT (and,\\nof course, STDERR), you should be able to run your AGI script directly from the operating\\nsystem. Second, Asterisk has a handy command for showing all of the communications\\nbetween itself and the AGI script: agi debug.\\n\\nDebugging from the Operating System\\nAs mentioned above, you should be able to run your program directly from the operating system to see how it behaves. The secret here is to act just like Asterisk does,\\nproviding your script with the following:\\n A list of variables and their values, such as agi_test:1.\\n A blank line feed (\\\\n) to indicate that you\\'re done passing variables.\\n Responses to each of the AGI commands from your AGI script. Usually, typing\\n200 response=1 is sufficient.\\n\\nDebugging in AGI | 223\\n\\x0cTrying your program directly from the operating system may help you to more easily\\nspot bugs in your program.\\n\\nUsing Asterisk\\'s agi debug Command\\nThe Asterisk command-line interface has a very useful command for debugging AGI\\nscripts, which is called (appropriately enough) agi debug. If you type agi debug at an\\nAsterisk console and then run an AGI, you\\'ll see something like the following:\\n-- Executing AGI(\"Zap/1-1\", \"temperature.php\") in new stack\\n-- Launched AGI Script /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/temperature.php\\nAGI Tx >> agi_request: temperature.php\\nAGI Tx >> agi_channel: Zap/1-1\\nAGI Tx >> agi_language: en\\nAGI Tx >> agi_type: Zap\\nAGI Tx >> agi_uniqueid: 1116732890.8\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callerid: 101\\nAGI Tx >> agi_calleridname: Tom Jones\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingpres: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingani2: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callington: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingtns: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_dnid: unknown\\nAGI Tx >> agi_rdnis: unknown\\nAGI Tx >> agi_context: incoming\\nAGI Tx >> agi_extension: 141\\nAGI Tx >> agi_priority: 2\\nAGI Tx >> agi_enhanced: 0.0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_accountcode:\\nAGI Tx >>\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE temperature \"\"\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE is \"\"\\nAGI Rx << SAY NUMBER 67 \"\"\\n-- Playing \\'digits/60\\' (language \\'en\\')\\n-- Playing \\'digits/7\\' (language \\'en\\')\\nAGI Tx >> 200 result=0\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE degrees \"\"\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE fahrenheit \"\"\\n-- AGI Script temperature.php completed, returning 0\\n\\nYou\\'ll see three types of lines while your AGI script is running. The first type, prefaced\\nwith AGI TX >>, are the lines that Asterisk transmits to your program\\'s STDIN. The second\\ntype, prefaced with AGI RX <<, are the commands your AGI program writes back to\\nAsterisk over STDOUT. The third type, prefaced by --, are the standard Asterisk messages\\npresented as it executes certain commands.\\nTo disable AGI debugging after it has been started, simply type agi no debug at an\\nAsterisk console.\\n\\n224 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cUsing the agi debug command will enable you to see the communication between\\nAsterisk and your program, which can be very useful when debugging. Hopefully, these\\ntwo tips will greatly improve your ability to write and debug powerful AGI programs.\\n\\nConclusion\\nFor a developer, AGI is one of the more revolutionary and compelling reasons to choose\\nAsterisk over a closed, proprietary PBX. Still, AGI is only part of the picture. In Chapter 10, we\\'ll explore another powerful programming interface known as the Asterisk\\nManager Interface.\\n\\nConclusion | 225\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nAsterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and\\nAdhearsion\\n\\nDo but take care to express yourself in a plain, easy\\nManner, in well-chosen, significant and decent Terms,\\nand to give a harmonious and pleasing Turn to your\\nPeriods: study to explain your Thoughts, and set them\\nin the truest Light, labouring as much as possible, not\\nto leave them dark nor intricate, but clear and\\nintelligible.\\n--Miguel de Cervantes, Preface to Don Quixote\\n\\nThe Manager Interface\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) is a powerful programmatic interface. It allows\\nexternal programs to both control and monitor an Asterisk system.* This interface is\\noften used to integrate Asterisk with existing business processes and systems, CRM\\n(Customer Relationship Management) software. It can also be used for a wide variety\\nof applications, such as automated dialers and click-to-call systems.\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface listens for connections on a network port. A client\\nprogram can then connect to the Asterisk Manager Interface on that port, authenticate\\nitself, and send commands to Asterisk. Asterisk will then respond to the request, as\\nwell as update the client program with the status of the system.\\nTo use the Manager, you must define an account\\nfile /etc/asterisk/manager.conf. This file will look something like this:\\n\\nin\\n\\nthe\\n\\n[general]\\nenabled = yes\\nport = 5038\\n* Contrast this with the Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI), which allows Asterisk to launch an external program\\n\\nfrom the dialplan. The AGI and AMI interfaces are very much complimentary to each other.\\n\\n\\x0cbindaddr = 0.0.0.0\\n[oreilly]\\nsecret = notvery\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user\\n\\nIn the [general] section, you have to enable the service by setting the parameter enabled\\n= yes. You will need to reload the Manager in order to have this change take effect\\n(module reload manager from the Asterisk console). The TCP port defaults to 5038.\\nNext, you create a section for each user that will authenticate to the system. For each\\nuser, you will specify the username in square brackets ([ ]), followed by the password\\nfor that user (secret), any IP addresses you wish to deny access to, any IP addresses you\\nwish to permit access to, and the read and write permissions for that user.\\nIt is very important to understand that other than a clear text password\\nand the ability to restrict IP addresses, there is no security of any kind\\non the Manager interface. If you are running Manager on an untrusted\\nnetwork (or have any other complex needs), you should consider using\\nDavid Troy\\'s excellent AstManProxy to handle all of your connections\\nto the manager API.\\n\\nConnecting to the Manager Interface\\nIt is important to keep in mind that the Manager interface is designed to be used by\\nprograms, not fingers. That\\'s not to say that you can\\'t issue commands to it directly--\\njust don\\'t expect a typical console interface, because that\\'s not what Manager is for.\\nCommands to Manager are delivered in packages with the following syntax (lines are\\nterminated with CR+LF):\\nAction: <action type>\\netc ...\\nVariable: Value\\nVariable: Value\\netc...\\n\\nFor example, to authenticate with Manager (which is required if you expect to have\\nany interaction whatsoever), you would send the following:\\n\\n Carriage Return followed by Line Feed. This is popularly achieved by pressing the Enter key on the keyboard,\\n\\nbut there are differences across various OS platforms and programming languages, so if you are having trouble\\nwith commands to the interface, it may be worth noting the exact character combination that is required. At\\nthe time of writing, Wikipedia had a respectable writeup on this concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\nNewline).\\n\\n228 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cAction: login\\nUsername: oreilly\\nSecret: notvery\\n<CR+LF>\\n\\nAn extra CR+LF on a blank line will submit the entire package to Manager.\\nOnce authenticated, you will be able to initiate actions, as well as see events generated\\nby Asterisk. On a busy system, this can get quite complicated and become totally impossible to keep track of with the unaided eye. To turn keep Asterisk from sending\\nevents, you can add the Events parameter to your login command, like this:\\nAction: login\\nUsername: oreilly\\nSecret: notvery\\nEvents: off\\n<CR+LF>\\n\\nIf you\\'re worried about sending your secret across the wire in plain text (which you\\nshould be), you can also authenticate using an MD5 challenge-response system, which\\nworks very similar to HTTP digest authentication. To do this, you first call the\\nChallenge action, which will present you with a challenge token:\\nAction: Challenge\\nResponse: Success\\n\\nYou can then take that challenge token, concatenate the plaintext secret onto the end\\nof it, and calculate the MD5 checksum of the resulting string. The result can then be\\nused to login without passing your secret in plain text.\\nAction: Login\\nUsername: Admin\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Authentication accepted\\n\\nSending Commands\\nOnce you\\'ve successfully logged into the AMI system, you can send commands to\\nAsterisk by using the other actions. We\\'ll show a few commands here so that you can\\nget a feel for how they work.\\n\\nTransferring a call\\nThe Redirect action can be used to transfer a call. After logging in, you should send an\\naction like the one below:\\n\\nThe Manager Interface | 229\\n\\x0cAction: Redirect\\nContext: Lab\\n\\nFor each action you sent over the manager interface, you can send along\\nan arbitrary ActionID value. This will allow you to recognize the responses from Asterisk as being related to your actions. It is strongly\\nrecommended that you send a unique ActionID with each of your AMI\\ncommands.\\n\\nThis URL transfers the specified channel to another extension and priority in the\\ndialplan. The response to this action is:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Redirect Successful\\n\\nReading a configuration file\\nTo read an Asterisk configuration file via the Manger interface, we can use the the\\nGetConfig action. The GetConfig action returns the contents of a configuration file, or\\nportion thereof. The following command retrieves the contents of the file users.conf.\\nAction: GetConfig\\nFilename: users.conf\\n\\nAsterisk then returns the contents of the users.conf file. The response looks like:\\nResponse: Success\\nLine-000000-000000: fullname=New User\\n\\n230 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cUpdating configuration files\\nIt is often useful to be able to update an Asterisk configuration file via the Asterisk\\nManager interface. The UpdateConfig action is used to update one or more settings in\\na configuration file. For example, to delete a user named 6003 from users.conf you could\\nissue the following command:\\nAction: UpdateConfig\\nFilename: users.conf\\nReload: yes\\nSrcFilename: users.conf\\nDstFilename: users.conf\\n\\nObviously, we\\'ve only scratched the surface of the many different actions available as\\npart of the Asterisk Manager Interface. For a more detailed listing of the available commands, see Appendix F.\\n\\nThe Flash Operator Panel\\nThe Flash Operator Panel (FOP) is one of the most popular examples of the power of\\nthe Manager interface. FOP presents a web-based visual view of your system and allows\\nyou control of calls.\\nFOP is most commonly used to enable a live attendant to view the users in the system\\nand connect calls between them. It can also be used in a call-center environment to\\nprovide CRM-triggered screen pops.\\nThe FOP management interface is shown in Figure 10-1. To grab a copy of FOP, head\\nto http://www.asternic.org.\\nFOP isn\\'t all that difficult to set up, but it does require several steps to configure. The\\nconfiguration of FOP is beyond the scope of this book, but if you head on over to the\\nFOP web site you will find the latest documentation detailing the installation and configuration process.\\nFOP has a fantastic community and a popular mailing list. The success of FOP has also\\nbeen aided by its inclusion in Trixbox.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion\\nRecently, a new bit of technology has come along which has the potential to change\\nthe way we create dialplans.\\n\\n Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is an interface that companies use to help manage customer\\n\\ninformation and interaction.\\n\\nThe Flash Operator Panel | 231\\n\\x0cFigure 10-1. The Flash Operator Panel management interface\\n\\nA New Approach to Dialplans\\nAsterisk has matured both in technological innovation and in popularity, but as one\\nbecomes more and more immersed in this wonderful world, one cannot help but bump\\ninto limitations. When you handle a lot of complex, enterprise-grade scripting with\\nAsterisk alone, you will face many obstacles using dialplan logic. As flexible and powerful as the dialplan is, as a programming language it is quite odd, and much less flexible\\nthan most modern scripting languages. When one needs to provide advanced logic, the\\ndialplan, the GUI, and even the more advanced AEL can become very frustrating.\\nAs you build more and more complexity into your dialplans, some of the following may\\ncause you some head-scratching:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConditional looping and branching\\nVariables\\nComplex data structures\\nDatabase/LDAP integration\\nUse of third-party libraries\\nExchanging and distributing VoIP functionality\\nExtending the configuration languages\\nPoor error handling\\nPoor date and time handling\\n\\n We would like to thank Jay Phillips for contributing the ideas and code for this section of the book.\\n\\n232 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0c Pattern matching\\n Usage consistency\\n Source code organization\\nMany people addressed these matters by writing the advanced logic in external programs such as Perl and PHP, and connecting to Asterisk via AMI and AGI. Unfortunately, while the desired power was now available, these interactions did not always\\nsimplify things for the developer. To the contrary, they often made development more\\ncomplex. Using existing technologies in Asterisk, but aiming to deliver power and simplicity, Adhearsion has a new approach.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion\\nAdhearsion is an open source (LGPL) framework that is designed to improve Asterisk\\nsolution development. It rests above an Asterisk system, handling parts or all of the\\ndialplan and, in a few unique ways, manages access to Asterisk with several improved\\ninterfaces. Because it runs as a separate daemon process and integrates through the\\nalready-present Gateway (AGI) and Manager (AMI) interfaces, configuring a context\\nto use Adhearsion is as simple as adding a few lines to your dialplan or adding a user\\nto manager.conf.\\nAdhearsion primarily uses the highly dynamic, object-oriented Ruby programming\\nlanguage, but has optional support for other languages such as C or Java. In the VoIP\\nworld, many things exist as conceptual objects, which means that object-oriented programming can make a lot of sense. Those familiar with Python, Perl, or other scripting\\nlanguages should have no trouble picking up Ruby, and for those who don\\'t, Ruby is\\nan excellent choice for your first scripting language.\\n\\nInstalling Adhearsion\\nRuby software is generally installed through Ruby\\'s package manager (similar to Linux\\npackage managers, but for the Ruby platform exclusively). Adhearsion exists as a gem\\nin the standard RubyGems trove so, with Ruby and RubyGems installed, Adhearsion\\nis only one install command away.\\n\\nInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on AsteriskNOW\\nAsteriskNOW comes standard with Ruby but not RubyGems (for support reasons).\\nThankfully, RubyGems can be easily installed from the Ruby rPath trove with the following command:\\nconary update rubygems=ruby.rpath.org@rpl:devel\\nsource /etc/profile\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 233\\n\\x0cInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on Linux\\nMost Linux distributions\\' package managers host a Ruby package, though some do\\nnot yet have RubyGems. With your respective distro\\'s preferred software management\\napplication, install Ruby 1.8.5 or later and RubyGems if available. If RubyGems is not\\navailable in CentOS, you can install Ruby by typing:\\nyum install ruby\\n\\nNext, we need RubyGems. You can get that by navigating to /usr/src/, and entering:\\ntar zxvf rubygems-0.9.3.tgz\\nruby setup.rb\\n\\nInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on Mac OS X\\nRuby actually ships standard with OS X, but you will need to upgrade it and install\\nRubyGems from MacPorts, an OS X package manager. With MacPorts installed, (available from http://www.macports.org if you do not already have it) you can install Ruby\\nand RubyGems with the following command:\\nsudo port install ruby rb-rubygems\\n\\nYou may also need to add /opt/local/bin to your PATH variable in /etc/profile.\\n\\nRuby/RubyGems on Windows\\nA fantastic \"one-click installer\" exists for Windows. This installer will automatically\\ninstall Ruby, RubyGems, and a few commonly used gems all in a matter of minutes.\\nYou can download the installer from http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller.\\n\\nInstalling Adhearsion from RubyGems\\nOnce you\\'ve followed one of the previous set of instructions for your system to fetch\\nRuby and RubyGems, install Adhearsion with the following command:\\ngem install adhearsion\\n\\nIf any dependencies are found, you will probably need to allow them to install for\\nAdhearsion to work correctly.\\n\\nExploring a New Adhearsion Project\\nWith Adhearsion installed, you can begin creating and initializing a new Adhearsion\\nproject with the newly created ahn command, a command-line utility that manages\\nnearly everything in Adhearsion.\\nA sample command for creating a new Adhearsion project is as follows:\\nahn create ~/newproject\\n\\n234 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cThis creates a folder at the destination specified containing the directory and file hierarchy Adhearsion needs to operate. Right away, you should be able to execute the newly\\ncreated application by running:\\nahn start ~/newproject\\n\\nTo familiarize yourself with the Adhearsion system, take a look through the application\\'s folders and read the accompanying documentation.\\n\\nAdhearsion dialplan writing\\nThe ability to write dialplans in Adhearsion is typically the first feature newcomers use.\\nSince Ruby permits such fine-grained modification of the language itself at runtime,\\none of the things Adhearsion does is make aesthetic changes, which are intended to\\nstreamline the process of developing dialplans.\\nBelow is an Adhearsion Hello World application:\\nmy_first_context {\\nplay \"hello-world\"\\n}\\n\\nThough this is completely valid Ruby syntax, not all Ruby applications look like this.\\nAdhearsion makes the declaration of context names comfortable by interpreting the\\ndialplan script specially. Your scripts will be located in the root folder of your newly\\ncreated Adhearsion application.\\nAs calls come into Asterisk and subsequently Adhearsion, Adhearsion invokes its own\\nversion of the context name from which the AGI request originated. Given this, we\\nshould ensure that a context in extensions.conf has this same name and forwards calls\\nproperly to Adhearsion.\\nThe syntax for directing calls to Adhearsion is as follows:\\n[my_first_context]\\nexten => _.,1,AGI(agi://127.0.0.1)\\n\\nThis catches any pattern dialed and goes off to Adhearsion via AGI to handle the callprocessing instructions for us. The IP provided here should of course be replaced with\\nthe necessary IP to reach your Adhearsion machine.\\nNow that you have a basic understanding of how Adhearsion and Asterisk interact,\\nhere is a more real-world dialplan example in Adhearsion:\\ninternal {\\ncase extension\\ndial SIP/extension\\n# Join a MeetMe conference with \"join\"\\njoin extension\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 235\\n\\x0celse speak \"The German office is closed\"\\nend\\nwhen US_NUMBER\\ndial SIP/\\'us-trunk-out\\'/extension\\nwhen /^\\\\d{11,}$/ # Perl-like regular expression\\n# Pass any other long numbers straight to our trunk.\\ndial IAX/\\'intl-trunk-out\\'/extension\\nelse\\nplay %w\\'sorry invalid extension please-try-again\\'\\nend\\n}\\n\\nWith just this small amount of code we accomplish quite a lot. Even with limited or\\nno knowledge of Ruby, you can probably infer the following things:\\n We use a switch-like statement on the \"extension\" variable (which Adhearsion\\ncreates for us) and branch depending on that.\\n Dialing a number between 10 and 99 routes us to the SIP peer with the dialed\\nnumerical username.\\n Any number dialed between 6000 and 6200 or between 7000 and 7030 goes to a\\nMeetMe conference of that same number. This of course requires meetme.conf to\\nhave these conference numbers configured.\\n The _\\'21XX\\' option comes straight from Asterisk\\'s pattern style. Prepending a\\nString with an underscore in Adhearsion secretly invokes a method that returns a\\nRuby regular expression. In a Ruby \"case\" statement, regular expressions can be\\nused in a \"when\" statement to check against a pattern. The end effect should be\\nvery familiar to those with extensions.conf writing experience.\\n Adhearsion\\'s syntax for representing channels also comes straight from Asterisk\\'s\\ntraditional format. SIP/123 can be used verbatim to represent the SIP peer 123. If\\na trunk were involved, SIP/trunkname/username would act as you would expect.\\n The speak() method abstracts an underlying text-to-speech engine. This can be\\nconfigured to use most of the popular engines.\\n A full-blown Perl-like regular can be used in a when statement to perform more\\nsophisticated pattern matching if Asterisk\\'s patterns do not suffice.\\n Adhearsion defines a few constants that may be useful to someone writing dialplans. The US_NUMBER constant here is a regular expression for matching an\\nAmerican number.\\n If you find the need to play several files in sequence, play() accepts an Array of\\nfilenames. By luck, Ruby has a convenient way of creating an Array of Strings.\\nThis is of course just a simple example and covers only the absolute basics of Adhearsion\\'s dialplan authoring capabilities.\\n\\n236 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cDatabase integration\\nThough immensely successful in the web development space for serving dynamic content, database integration has always been an underutilized possibility for driving\\ndynamic voice applications with Asterisk. Most Asterisk applications that do accomplish database integration outsource the complexity to a PHP or Perl AGI script because\\nthe extensions.conf or AEL grammars are simply impractical for the level of sophistication required.\\nAdhearsion uses a database integration library, called ActiveRecord, developed by the\\nmakers of the Ruby on Rails framework. With ActiveRecord, the end user seldom, if\\never, writes SQL statements. Instead, the developer accesses the database just like any\\nRuby object. Because Ruby allows such flexible dynamism, access to the database looks\\nand feels quite natural. Additionally, ActiveRecord abstracts the differences between\\ndatabase management systems, making your database access implementation agnostic.\\nWithout going too much into the internals of ActiveRecord and more sophisticated\\nuses of it, let us consider the following simple MySQL schema:\\nCREATE TABLE groups (\\n`id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,\\n`description` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`hourly_rate` decimal DEFAULT NULL\\n);\\nCREATE TABLE customers (\\n`id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,\\n`name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`phone_number` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`group_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL\\n);\\n\\nIn practice we would obviously store much more information about the customer and\\nkeep the service usage information in a database-driven call detail record, but this degree of simplicity helps demonstrate ActiveRecord fundamentals more effectively.\\nTo connect Adhearsion to this database, one simply specifies the database access information in a YAML configuration file like so:\\nadapter: mysql\\nhost: localhost\\ndatabase: adhearsion\\nusername: root\\npassword: pass\\n\\nThis tells Adhearsion how to connect to the database, but how we access information\\nin the tables depends on how we model our ActiveRecord objects. Since an object is\\nan instance of a class, we write a class definition to wrap around each table. We define\\nsimple properties and relationships in the class with the superclass\\'s methods.\\nHere are two classes we may use with the aforementioned tables:\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 237\\n\\x0cclass Customer < ActiveRecord::Base\\nbelongs_to :group\\nvalidates_presence_of\\n:name, :phone_number\\nvalidates_uniqueness_of :phone_number\\nvalidates_associated\\n:group\\ndef total_bill\\nself.group.hourly_rate * self.usage_this_month / 1.hour\\nend\\nend\\nclass Group < ActiveRecord::Base\\nhas_many :customers\\nvalidates_presence_of :description, :hourly_rate\\nend\\n\\nFrom just this small amount of information, ActiveRecord can make a lot of logical\\ninferences. When these classes interpret, ActiveRecord assumes the table names to be\\ncustomers and groups respectively by lowercasing the classes\\' names and making them\\nplural. If this convention is not desired, the author can easily override it. Additionally,\\nat interpretation time, ActiveRecord actually peeks into the database\\'s columns and\\nmakes available many new dynamically created methods.\\nThe belongs_to and has_many methods in this example define relationships between\\nCustomers and Groups. Notice again how ActiveRecord uses pluralization to make the\\ncode more expressive in the has_many :customers line. From this example, we also see\\nseveral validations--policies that ActiveRecord will enforce. When creating a new\\nCustomer we must provide a name and phone_number at the bare minimum. No two phone\\nnumbers can conflict. Every Customer must have a Group. Every Group must have a\\ndescription and hourly_rate. These help both the developer and the database stay on\\ntrack.\\nAlso, notice the total_bill method in the Customer class. On any Customer object we\\nextract from the database, we can call this method, which multiplies the hourly_rate\\nvalue of the group to which the Customer belongs by the Customer\\'s own phone usage\\nthis month (in seconds).\\nHere are a few examples that may clarify the usefulness of having Ruby objects abstract\\ndatabase logic:\\neveryone = Customer.find :all\\njay = Customer.find_by_name\\njay.phone_number # Performs\\njay.total_bill\\n# Performs\\njay.group.customers.average\\n\\n\"Jay Phillips\"\\na SELECT statement\\narithmetic on several SELECT statements\\n:usage_this_month\\n\\njay.group.destroy\\njay.group = Group.create :description => \"New cool group!\",\\n:hourly_rate => 1.23\\njay.save\\n\\n238 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cBecause the database integration here becomes much more natural, Asterisk dialplans\\nbecomes much more expressive as well. Below is a sample dialplan of a service provider\\nthat imposes a time limit on outgoing calls using information from the database. To\\nremain simple:\\n# Let\\'s assume we\\'re offering VoIP service to customers\\n# whom we can identify with their callerid.\\nservice {\\n# The line of code below performs an SQL SELECT\\n# statement on our database. The find_by_phone_number()\\n# method was created automatically because ActiveRecord\\n# found a phone_number column in the database. Adhearsion\\n# creates the \"callerid\" variable for us.\\ncaller = Customer.find_by_phone_number callerid\\nusage = caller.usage_this_month\\nif usage >= 100.hours\\nplay \"sorry-cant-let-you-do-that\"\\nelse\\nplay %w\\'to-hear-your-account-balance press-1\\notherwise wait-moment\\'\\nchoice = wait_for_digit 3.seconds\\np choice\\nif choice == 1\\ncharge = usage / 60.0 * caller.group.hourly_rate\\nplay %W\"your-account will-reflect-charge-of $#{charge}\\nthis month for #{usage / 60} minutes and\\n#{usage % 60} seconds\"\\nend\\n# We can also write back to the \"usage_this_month\"\\n# property of \"caller\". When the time method finishes,\\n# the database will be updated for this caller.\\ncaller.usage_this_month += time do\\n# Code in this block is timed.\\ndial IAX/\\'main-trunk\\'/extension\\nend\\ncaller.save\\nend\\n}\\n\\nRobust database integration like this through Adhearsion brings new ease to developing\\nfor and managing a PBX. Centrally persistent information allows Asterisk to integrate\\nwith other services cleanly while empowering more valuable services whose needs are\\nbeyond that of traditional Asterisk development technologies.\\n\\nDistributing and reusing code\\nBecause an Adhearsion application resides within a single folder, completely copying\\nthe VoIP application is as simple as zipping the files. For one of the first times in the\\nAsterisk community, users can easily exchange and build upon one another\\'s successful\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 239\\n\\x0capplication. In fact, open sourcing individual Adhearsion applications is greatly encouraged.\\nAdditionally, on a more localized level, users can reuse Adhearsion framework extensions, called helpers, or roll their own. Helpers range from entire sub-frameworks like\\nthe Micromenus framework for integrating with on-phone micro-browsers to adding\\na trivial new dialplan method that returns a random quote by Oscar Wilde.\\nBelow is a simple Adhearsion helper written in Ruby. It creates a new method that will\\nexist across the entire framework, including the dialplan. For simplicity\\'s sake, the\\nmethod downloads an XML document at a specified HTTP URL and converts it to a\\nRuby Hash object (Ruby\\'s associative array type):\\ndef remote_parse url\\nHash.from_xml open(url).read\\nend\\n\\nNote that these three lines can work as the entire contents of a helper file. When Adhearsion boots, it executes the script in a way that makes any methods or classes defined\\navailable anywhere in the system.\\nFor some issues, particularly ones of scaling Adhearsion, it may be necessary to profile\\nout bottlenecks to the king of efficiency: C. Below is a sample Adhearsion helper that\\nreturns the factorial of a number given:\\nint fast_factorial(int input) {\\nint fact = 1, count = 1;\\nwhile(count <= input) {\\nfact *= count++;\\n}\\nreturn fact;\\n}\\n\\nAgain, the code here can exist as the entire contents of a helper file. In this case, because\\nit is written in C, it should have the name factorial.alien.c. This tells Adhearsion to\\ninvoke its algorithm to read the file, add in the standard C and Ruby language development headers, compile it, cache the shared object, load it into the interpreter, and\\nthen wrap the C method in a Ruby equivalent. Below is a sample dialplan that simply\\nspeaks back the factorial of six using this C helper:\\nfast_test {\\nnum = fast_factorial 6\\nplay num\\n}\\n\\nNote that the C method becomes a first-class Ruby method. Ruby number objects\\npassed to the method are converted to C\\'s \"int\" primitive, and the return value is converted back to a Ruby number object.\\nHelpers promise robust albeit simple extensibility to a VoIP engineer\\'s toolbox, but,\\nbest of all, useful helpers can be traded and benefit the entire community.\\n\\n240 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cIntegrate with Your Desk Phone Using Micromenus\\nWith increasing competition between modern IP-enabled desk phone manufacturers,\\nthe microbrowser feature has snuck in relatively unnoticed and underutilized. The\\nprinciple is simple: physical desk phones construct interactive menus on a phone by\\npulling XML over HTTP or the like. Contending interests, however, lead this\\ntechnology amiss: every vendor\\'s XML differs, microbrowsers are often quirky, and\\navailable features vary vastly.\\nThe Micromenus framework exists as an Adhearsion helper and aims to abstract the\\ndifferences between vendors\\' phones. For this very particular development domain\\n(i.e., creating menus), Micromenus use a very simple Ruby-based \"Domain Specific\\nLanguage\" to program logic cleanly and independent of any phone brands.\\nBelow is a simple example Micromenu:\\nimage \\'company-logo\\'\\nitem \"Call an Employee\" do\\n# Creates a list of employees as callable links from a database.\\nEmployee.find(:all).each do |someone|\\n# Simply select someone to call that person on your phone.\\ncall someone.extension, someone.full_name\\nend\\nend\\nitem \"Weather Information\" do\\ncall \"Hear the weather report\" do\\nplay weather_report(\"Portland, OR\")\\nend\\nitem \"Current: \" + weather(\"Portland, OR\")[:current][:temp]\\nend\\nitem \"System Uptime: \" + `uptime`\\n\\nA list item displays in two ways. If given only a text String, Micromenus renders only\\na text element. If the arguments contain a do/end block of nested information, that text\\nbecomes a link to a sub-page rendering that nested content.\\nA call item also has two uses, each producing a link which, when selected, initiates a\\ncall. When call receives no do/end block, it simulates physically dialing the number\\ngiven as the first argument. When a do/end block exists and all calls route through\\nAdhearsion, selecting that item executes the dialplan functionality within the block.\\nThis is a great example of how handling the dialplans and on-screen microbrowsers\\nwithin the same framework pays off well.\\nFrom this example we can see a few other neat things about Micromenus:\\n Micromenus support sending images. If the requesting phone does not support\\nimages, the response will have no mention of them.\\n All Adhearsion helpers work here, too. We use the weather helper in this example.\\n The Micromenus sub-framework can use Adhearsion\\'s database integration.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 241\\n\\x0c Ruby can execute a command inside backticks and return the result as a String.\\nWe report the uptime here with it.\\nThis example of course assumes that you have configured your application\\'s database\\nintegration properly and have an Employee class mapping to a table with an exten\\nsion and full_name column.\\nBecause Micromenus simply render varying responses over HTTP, a normal web\\nbrowser can make a request to the Micromenus\\' server, too. For these more high-tech\\nendpoints, Micromenus render an attractive interface with Ajax loading, DHTML effects, and draggable windows.\\nIn the interest of \"adhering\" people together, Micromenus exist as another option to\\nmake your Adhearsion VoIP applications more robust.\\n\\nIntegrating with a Web Application\\nThough Adhearsion by design can integrate with virtually any application, including\\nPHP or Java Servlets, Ruby on Rails makes for a particularly powerful partner. Rails is\\na web development framework getting a lot of press lately for all the right reasons. Its\\ndevelopers use Ruby to its full potential, showing how meta-programming really does\\neliminate unnecessary developer work. Rails\\' remarkable code clarity and application\\nof the Don\\'t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle served as a strong inspiration to the inception of Adhearsion as it exists today.\\nStarting with Adhearsion version 0.8.0, Adhearsion\\'s application directory drops in\\nplace atop an existing Rails application, sharing data automatically. If you have needs\\nto develop a complex web interface to VoIP functionality, consider this deadly duo.\\n\\nUsing Java\\nEyebrows around the world raised when Sun announced their hiring of the two core\\ndevelopers of the JRuby interpreter project, Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo, in\\nSeptember 2006. JRuby is a Ruby interpreter written in Java instead of C. Because JRuby\\ncan compile parts of a Ruby application to Java bytecode, JRuby is actually outperforming the C implementation of Ruby 1.8 in many different benchmarks and promises\\nto outperform Ruby 1.8 in all cases in the near future.\\nA Ruby application running in JRuby has the full benefit of not only Ruby libraries but\\nany Java library as well. Running Adhearsion in JRuby brings the dumbfounding assortment of third-party Java libraries to PBX dialplan writing. If your corporate\\nenvironment requires tight integration with other Java technologies, embedding Adhearsion in a J2EE stack may offer the flexibility needed.\\n\\n242 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cMore Information\\nFor more information about the fast-moving Adhearsion community, including complete walkthroughs, see Adhearsion\\'s official web site at http://adhearsion.com, Adhearsion\\'s official blog at http://blog.adhearsion.com, the web site of Adhearsion\\'s\\nparent consulting company http://codemecca.com, or for help learning Ruby, see http://\\njicksta.com.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 243\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nThe Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\n...I was constructing a lighthouse while all the others\\nwere making ships.\\n--Charles Simic\\n\\nThis chapter introduces the components that comprise the GUI and help it work with\\nAsterisk. It describes the installation of the web server and the GUI components for\\nthose who are not using the AsteriskNOW distribution. It also shows you how to\\nmodify the GUI to suit your purposes. Technical information is also provided so that\\ndevelopers wishing to create their own GUI or application can utilize the web server\\nand GUI components. We\\'d like to thank the folks at Digium for writing this chapter,\\nespecially the code examples, which they developed and tested.\\n\\nWhy a GUI for Asterisk?\\nSince the beginning, Asterisk has been a phone system for the brave. In the early days\\nit took guts and more than a bit of tenacity to make Asterisk do your bidding. Those\\nwilling to accept the learning curve, wade into the config files, and fight for their calls\\nwere rewarded with a powerful, flexible phone system (as well as a very marketable\\nskill set). However, the mass market was not, and is not, ready to script extensions,\\nmanage peers, and handle the other tasks that are the crux of Asterisk administration.\\nSince the early pre-1.0 days, people have tried to tame the mighty Asterisk with config\\nfile generators tied to databases and managed via a range of graphical user interfaces\\n(GUIs). The most successful of these did a fine job of creating an Asterisk-based application, but none of them provided the full flexibility that the raw scripting environment offers. By replacing the digital haiku of the dialplan with a limited list of options,\\nthe resulting system is reduced from Asterisk to an Asterisk-based system. Not a bad\\nthing, but not the whole enchilada.*\\n* In fact, two of the authors of this book once attempted to write the ultimate Asterisk GUI. Lucky for you,\\n\\nthey abandoned the project and began writing Asterisk documentation instead!\\n\\n\\x0cIn order for a GUI to be the Asterisk GUI, it would have to leave intact the manually\\nscripted configuration files that have been the lingua franca of Asterisk since the dawn\\nof time. It would have to provide a simple, graphical means of configuration without\\ncompromising the underlying Asterisk software or irrevocably fixing decisions that\\nshould be left open to the end user. It would also have to provide advanced functionality\\nwithout taxing the computer or stealing valuable resources from the core goal of processing calls.\\nCoinciding with the release of Asterisk 1.4, Digium launched the Asterisk GUI project.\\nThe GUI was originally conceived as a component of Digium\\'s Asterisk embedded\\nappliance. The appliance, sold as the Asterisk Appliance Developers Kit (AADK) as\\nwell as in a standalone configuration, is a small, solid-state Linux computer with optional analog (and potentially digital) interfaces. The GUI was built using a flexible and\\nexpandable framework that placed as much of the display and validation logic as possible on the client computer. It also took into consideration the need to preserve\\nhandwritten config files while providing an automated means of editing them. The\\nresulting framework is known as AJAM (a play on the popular \"Web 2.0\" technology\\nknown as Ajax), which means Asynchronous JavaScript and Asterisk Manager. The\\ncore AJAM code, a series of AJAM-enabled web pages, and an extension to the Asterisk\\nmanager work together to form the Asterisk GUI framework.\\n\\nWhat Is the GUI?\\nThe Asterisk GUI is the interface that comes with the AsteriskNOW distribution or\\ncan be added to an existing Asterisk installation. The default interface is geared toward\\nthe user who wants to use Asterisk as a PBX for a small business with fairly typical\\ntelecom needs. It can best be thought of as a sample of what can be done using AJAM;\\nthink of it as a beta interface that can be expected to evolve according to the desires of\\nthe community. This has caused a lot of excitement in the Asterisk community, because\\nthe underlying technologies behind the GUI raise the bar on what a PBX interface can\\nbecome. It also enables you to build your own interfaces that are tuned to your unique\\nrequirements.\\n\\nMark Spencer Talks About the GUI\\nAsterisk is a powerful telephony platform. However, that power is only as valuable as its\\nability to be used by a particular target user. There is a lot of value to having graphical\\ninterfaces (GUIs) for Asterisk. Most GUIs are specifically designed to support a particular\\ntask. For example, some GUIs are designed specifically for voicemail systems. Others are\\nspecifically targeted to the hospitality industry. There is some demand to have a GUI that\\ntargets Asterisk generally, but there is a natural trade-off between the ease of use and\\nsimplicity of a GUI, versus the number of available features. For example, the GUI that\\na seasoned systems administrator might require would likely be different than that of an\\noffice administrator who is only responsible for simple moves, adds, and changes to the\\nsystem. Given this wide ranging demand, Digium developed a GUI framework called\\n\\n246 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c(uncreatively) the Asterisk GUI. Rather than developing a single GUI, Digium developed\\ndifferent GUIs and a framework to trivialize the creation and modification of GUIs for\\ndifferent segments.\\nA second goal was to make sure that the GUI interacted with Asterisk\\'s traditional configuration methods in a way that did not preclude someone from using them. Most GUIs\\nfor Asterisk use an intermediate configuration format or database, then spit out configs\\nfor Asterisk to use. Unfortunately that means that any option that is not presented within\\nthe GUI cannot be \"manually\" set in the configuration files. By contrast, the Asterisk\\nGUI actually modifies your traditional Asterisk configuration files, meaning that your\\nchanges in the GUI and your changes to the files themselves can co-exist and even flow\\nback and forth. As an example, if you change the caller ID for a user in users.conf then\\nrefresh the GUI, you\\'ll see the change in the GUI as well. Likewise if you change it in the\\nGUI and reload the file, you\\'ll see the change in the file. If you add new settings that are\\nnot presented in the GUI (for example if you add nat=yes to a particular entry in\\nusers.conf, then change the caller ID in the GUI, you\\'ll see that the nat=yes line will remain\\nin the file even though the caller ID change goes through. Comments are also generally\\npreserved across GUI edits. This means that not only is the GUI no longer required to\\ndisplay all possible configurations, since esoteric ones can be set manually. This also\\nmeans that when someone starts by using the Asterisk GUI and then outgrows it, there\\nis a natural path for them to be able to start creating more sophisticated functions without\\nabandoning the GUI with which they\\'re familiar.\\n\\nUsing the GUI\\nWhen you first log in to a newly created GUI, the system walks you through a wizard\\nthat lets you set up the basic elements of your phone system.\\nThe GUI may not be able to detect all types of TDM interfaces, and thus\\nmay report that it cannot find any cards even though you have some\\ninstalled. It is expected that the GUI will eventually be able to detect\\nand manage any cards that use the Zaptel interface, but this functionality is going to be complex, and is still in development at this time.\\n\\nThe wizard walks you through some basic settings such as extension length and dialing\\nrules. We are not going to get into detail on how the default GUI works. It is in constant\\ndevelopment, and what we write about here is not likely to be what you will experience\\nwhen you read this.\\n\\nGUI elements\\nThe standard GUI that comes with AsteriskNOW (or can be downloaded via SVN) has\\na standard set of elements that represent the sorts of things a typical small office PBX\\nmight want. The menu items are currently:\\n Users\\n Conferencing\\n Voicemail\\nWhat Is the GUI? | 247\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCall Queues\\nService Providers\\nCalling Rules\\nIncoming Calls\\nVoice Menus\\nRecord a Menu\\nActive Channels\\nGraphs\\nSystem Info\\nBackup\\nOptions\\n\\nArchitecture of the Asterisk GUI\\nBefore we get too far into exploring the Asterisk GUI (or developing your own), it\\'s\\nimportant to understand the flow of information between the client (the web browser)\\nand Asterisk. Since these interfaces are Ajax applications, there are a lot of pieces that\\naren\\'t immediately obvious. The flow of control goes something like this:\\n The browser \"surfs to\" the URL for your management application.\\n Asterisk\\'s web server sends the browser an HTML page, libraries, and the application itself (which is written in JavaScript and makes heavy use of Ajax).\\n The user interacts with the browser; as needed, the JavaScript application sends\\ncommands back to the web server. These commands are in the form of URLs that\\nrequest some action from the Asterisk server itself.\\n The web server interprets the URLs. If the user has logged in successfully, it sends\\na command (an action) to Asterisk via the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), described in Chapter 10.\\n Asterisk executes the action and the results (a status code and possibly data) to the\\nweb server.\\n The web server sends Asterisk\\'s response back to the JavaScript application on the\\nbrowser.\\n The JavaScript application updates the browser\\'s display.\\nWhile it may sound a little complicated at first glance, don\\'t be intimidated. It\\'s a very\\nflexible and powerful architecture that can be used for a myriad of applications, not\\njust an Asterisk GUI. For now, however, we\\'ll concentrate on enhancing the Asterisk\\nGUI. Let\\'s begin by configuring the underlying pieces, and then move on to installing\\nand modifying the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\n248 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cComponents of the Asterisk GUI\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at some of the key components of the Asterisk GUI. We\\'ll use\\nthese components later in the chapter to modify the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\nAsterisk Manager Interface\\nAs explained in Chapter 10, the Asterisk Manager Interface allows external programs\\nto control Asterisk. The Manager interface is the heart of the Asterisk GUI, as it does\\nall of the heavy lifting.\\n\\nManager over HTTP and the Asterisk web server\\nThe web server built into Asterisk allows manager commands to be sent to Asterisk via\\nHTTP, instead of creating a socket connection directly to the Manager interface. This\\nmakes it much simpler for a web application to issue AMI commands to Asterisk using\\nthe Asynchronous JavaScript Asterisk Manager (AJAM), which we will cover shortly.\\nThe web server can also be configured to serve static content, such as HTML files and\\nimages.\\n\\nAJAM and JavaScript\\nThe AJAM framework uses JavaScript and XML to asynchronously send commands to\\nAsterisk, and to update the information displayed in the web browser.\\n\\nInstalling the Asterisk GUI\\nIf you didn\\'t install AsteriskNOW, you need to download and install the Asterisk GUI\\nfiles. Once the files are downloaded, you simply compile and install them as part of\\nyour Asterisk installation.\\nYou need Asterisk 1.4 or later in order use the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\n You may be asking yourself, \"Why embed a web server inside of Asterisk? Why not just use an external web\\n\\nserver?\" While you can use an external web server to serve up the Asterisk GUI, it\\'s beyond the scope of this\\nchapter, as the security model behind Ajax permits Ajax requests only to the same domain, port, and protocol\\nthat sent the HTML page. This is often referred to as the same-origin policy.\\n\\nInstalling the Asterisk GUI | 249\\n\\x0cYou can get the latest version of the GUI files by checking them out of Digium\\'s Subversion repository. If you have Subversion installed on your computer, you can\\ndownloaded the GUI code by using the following command:\\n# cd /usr/src\\n# or wherever you prefer to download source code to\\n# svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk-gui/trunk asterisk-gui\\n\\nInstalling the GUI is simple as this:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd asterisk-gui\\n./configure\\nmake\\nmake install\\nmake samples\\n\\nAfter running the previous commands, the GUI files are installed and part of your\\nAsterisk distribution.\\n\\nSetting up httpd.conf and manager.conf\\nConfiguring the Asterisk web server to process AJAM requests involves several simple\\nsteps. In the /etc/asterisk/http.conf file, add (or un-comment) the following:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\nenablestatic=yes\\nprefix=asterisk\\n\\n; without this, you can only send AMI commands, not display\\n; html content\\n; address you want the Asterisk HTTP server to respond on\\n; port you want the Asterisk HTTP server to respond on\\n; will form part of the URI, similar to a directory name\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve got httpd.conf set up, we can serve up content to a browser. To allow\\nthe web client to send commands to Asterisk, we have to make some changes to the\\nAsterisk Manger Interface (AMI). We do this by adding a few lines to the [general]\\nsection of manager.conf, and by adding a user account with the config permission set.\\nOpen up manager.conf and edit it to match the following:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\nwebenabled=yes\\n\\n; you may already have AMI enabled if you are using it for other things\\n; this enables the interaction between the Asterisk web server and AMI\\n\\n[asterisk_http] ; you can name the user whatever you want\\nsecret = gooey\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\n\\nSave the changes and restart Asterisk. You should be able to connect to Asterisk\\'s web\\nserver through the following URI:\\n There is currently no way to download the GUI via FTP. That situation may change at any time, so feel free\\n\\nto check the Asterisk web site for updated information.\\n\\n250 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c\\nIf for some reason you\\'re having problems getting to that demo page, go back to the\\nasterisk-gui source code directory and run:\\n# make checkconfig\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it! Asterisk is now web-enabled. Now, let\\'s move on to the actual work of\\ndeveloping with the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI\\nOnce you\\'ve installed the files for the Asterisk GUI, you can begin to play with developing for the GUI. Over the next few sections, we\\'ll walk through setting up the various\\ncomponents and putting them together to enhance and expand the capabilities of the\\nGUI.\\n\\nIssuing Manager Commands over HTTP\\nThe Asterisk GUI issues commands to Asterisk by calling specially crafted URLs to the\\nAsterisk web server. This section provides examples of some commonly used commands (actions) and the corresponding web server responses. These AMI URLs have\\nthe following general structure:\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/rawman?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/manager?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/mxml?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\n\\nThe difference between the rawman, manager and mxml URLs is important. The web server\\nexports three different views of the AMI interface. If you use a rawman URL, the server\\nreturns a series of keyword/value pairs in the HTTP response. If you use a manager URL,\\nthe server returns the result formatted as HTML. In a similar style, if you use a mxml\\nURL, the server returns the results formatted in XML. For modern Ajax-style applications, the rawman and mxml forms are probably more useful.\\nThe actions that can be sent to the server, along with their parameters, are the ordinary\\nmanager commands described in Appendix F. Note that the LOGIN and CHALLENGE actions are unique in that they aren\\'t sent to Asterisk itself, but are processed by the\\nManager interface to authenticate the user. If the user hasn\\'t authenticated correctly,\\nthe server returns an error response rather than sending the action to Asterisk for processing.\\nLet\\'s look at some commonly used actions, and see how we can use them to control\\nthe server.\\n\\n By similar reasoning, the manager form is much easier for humans to use for debugging purposes.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 251\\n\\x0cLOGIN\\nThe LOGIN command authenticates credentials for the Manager interface\\'s HTML view.\\nOnce you are logged in, Asterisk stores a cookie on your browser (valid for the length\\nof the httptimeout setting). This cookie is used to connect to the same session. The URL:\\n&secret=gooey\\nsends a login command to the web server that includes the credentials. If successful,\\nthe web server responds with:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Authentication accepted\\n\\nThis, of course, is a very simplistic way for a login to work. Sending the username and\\nsecret password in a URL is bad practice, though it\\'s very useful during development.\\nA more appropriate way to handle the login, and an example of more complex command processing, is to use a challenge/response sequence. Issue a request like this:\\nThe CHALLENGE command initiates a challenge/response sequence that can be used to\\nlog in a user. The server responds by sending a challenge (an arbitrary string) in the\\nresponse:\\nResponse: Success\\n\\nYour application answers the challenge by computing the MD5 hash of the challenge\\nconcatenated with the user\\'s password. Here\\'s how a user might manually calculate\\nthe MD5 hash:\\n# echo -n 113543555gooey | md5sum\\n\\n-\\n\\nYou can then use the calculated hash as the login key in a URL like this:\\nFor security reasons, the login action must take place within five seconds\\nof the challenge action. Note also that cookies must be enabled for the\\nchallenge/response to work, as the cookie ensures that the login action\\nuses the same manager session ID as the challenge action.\\n\\nIf you use a manager URL to request the challenge (instead of using rawman), the response\\nwill be formatted as HTML:\\n<title>Asterisk&trade; Manager Interface</title>\\n<body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\\n\\n252 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c<tr><td>Response</td><td>Success</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</body>\\n\\nSimilarly, if you use the mxml view instead, you will receive a response formatted as XML:\\n<Ajax-response>\\n<response type=\\'object\\' id=\\'unknown\\'>\\n<generic response=\\'Success\\' challenge=\\'113543555\\' />\\n</response>\\n</Ajax-response>\\n\\nOther than the formatting, there are no other differences between the three types of\\nresponses. For most applications, digging the challenge out of the keyword/value pairs\\nwill be much simpler than using rawman or mxml in a situation like this, where you don\\'t\\nneed to display the HTML to the user.\\n\\nTransferring a call\\nThe REDIRECT action can be used to transfer a call. Simply generate a URL such as:\\nThis URL transfers the specified channel to another extension and priority in the\\ndialplan. The response to this action is:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Redirect Successful\\n\\nReading a configuration file\\nThe GETCONFIG command returns the contents of a configuration file, or portion thereof.\\nThe URL:\\nreturns the contents of the users.conf file. The Asterisk GUI uses this functionality to\\npresent the current Asterisk configuration to the end user. The response looks like this:\\nResponse: Success\\nLine-000000-000000: fullname=New User\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 253\\n\\x0cLine-000001-000000: fullname=Bill Savage\\n\\nUpdating configuration files using UPDATECONFIG\\nThe UPDATECONFIG action is used to update one or more settings in a configuration file.\\nFor example, to delete a user you should use a URL like this:\\n\\nError response\\nA user must be logged in to the web server before any other commands can be issued.\\nAny of the commands we\\'ve discussed will return an error response if the user is not\\nauthenticated. If it\\'s not given by an authenticated user, this URI http://localhost:8088/\\nasterisk/rawman?action=ping returns this response to indicate an error:\\nResponse: Error\\nMessage: Authentication Required\\n\\nAjax, AJAM, and Asterisk\\nAs an acronym, Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. While the term\\nincludes the words asynchronous and XML, this does not mean that you can make only\\nasynchronous requests, nor are you required to use XML. Some authors describe Ajax\\nas simply a combination of HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, and DOM. The next generation browsers, such as Mozilla/Firefox, use an XMLHttpRequest (a JavaScript object)\\nto send an asynchronous request to the server. The request is made in the background\\nand processed by the server.\\n\\n254 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cBack on the browser, the result is handled by a callback: whatever the server returns\\ncan be stored and used to update the page being displayed. For Internet Explorer 5 or\\nlater, the XMLHttp ActiveX object serves the same purpose.\\n\\nForm processing in a traditional web application\\nHTML forms are usually submitted by using a submit button (type=submit). When the\\nuser clicks the submit button, processing stops, and doesn\\'t continue until the server\\nreturns a new page:\\n<FORM action=\"login.php\" method=\"POST\">\\n<input type=text name=\"username\">\\n<input type=password name=\"password\">\\n<input type=submit>\\n</FORM>\\n\\nBefore going any further with Ajax or JavaScript, let\\'s take a look at how a traditional\\nweb application works. Traditional web applications use HTML\\'s <FORM> element to\\ndefine a form in which all of the parameters a user needs to send to the server are defined.\\nIn addition the action=\"login.php\" informs the browser where to send all of these\\nvariables. The method=\"POST\" tells the browser how to send these variables to the server.\\n\\nForm processing in an Ajax application\\nAn Ajax application uses JavaScript to send the contents of a form to the server. If you\\nhave made the request asynchronously, your JavaScript code doesn\\'t wait for the server\\nto respond. This also means that you can let the users continue to interact with the\\npage, even though a request may be taking place in the background. This can be dangerous and, thus, you may want to restrict certain actions until a request has completed.\\nThe browser, by default, gives no visual indication that a request is being made in the\\nbackground. It is your responsibility to inform the user of the progress of a request.\\nHere\\'s the code for submitting the contents of the username and password fields via\\nAjax:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction submitform(){\\nvar uname = document.getElementById(\"username\").value;\\nvar pwd = document.getElementById(\"password\").value;\\n// xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\"); // IE 7\\n// xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\"); // IE 5\\nxmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Mozilla or Firefox\\nvar url = \"/rawman?action=login&username=\" + escape(uname) + \"&secret=\" + escape(pwd);\\nxmlHttp.open(\"GET\", url, true);\\nxmlHttp.onreadystatechange = dosomething;\\n// dosomething() would be another JavaScript function\\nxmlHttp.send(null);\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 255\\n\\x0cThe getElementById() method reads the value of the username and the password fields.\\nThis code then gets an XMLHttpRequest object, which it uses to send these values back\\nto the server. Note that the kind of object you need depends on whether your users are\\nusing Internet Explorer 7, 5, or Mozilla/Firefox. It\\'s fairly easy to write code to handle\\nall of these situations, or to use a library like Prototype to handle platform independence\\nfor you. The username and password are encoded in a URL and sent to the server. The\\ncall to xmlHttp.onreadystatechange registers a handler to process the result that the\\nserver returns to us.\\nThis code only deals with making the XMLHttp request, and it tells the browser to call\\nthe dosomething() function when there is a response from the server. Here\\'s a\\ndosomething() function that handles this response:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction dosomething() {\\nif (xmlHttp.readyState == 4) {\\nvar login_response = xmlHttp.responseText;\\n}\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nMake sure that each XMLHttp step has completed (with either success\\nor failure) before performing the next one.\\n\\nThis function is called whenever there\\'s a change in the state of the HTTP request. The\\nif statement saves the response only if the request\\'s readyState is 4, which means that\\nthe request has completed. The JavaScript variable login_response now contains the\\nresponse of the login page.\\nNote that this is very far from being production-ready code. In particular, the simplistic\\nusername and password handling is appropriate for testing, but would be a serious\\nsecurity problem in a production system--even if the application is used only on a\\nprivate network. To build more robust and secure password handling, use the challenge/response system presented earlier. If you want to learn more about writing Ajax\\nweb applications, we recommend Head Rush Ajax by Brett McLaughlin (O\\'Reilly).\\n\\nThe Prototype framework\\nPrototype (http://prototypejs.org) is a JavaScript framework released under an MIT-style\\nlicense. Prototype can make your job extremely easy while developing an Ajax application. It provides many ways to make your code shorter and clearer. For example, in\\nthe submitform function, the call to document.getElementById() can be replaced by the\\n$() function. Likewise, the call to value to get the DOM element\\'s content can be\\nreplaced with a call to $F(). Thus, document.getElementById(\"username\").value becomes simply $F(\\'username\\'); the result is code that\\'s much simpler and more readable.\\n\\n256 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cPrototype also makes it easy to make XMLHttp requests in an elegant manner. Using\\nPrototype\\'s Ajax object, the submitform() function can be rewritten as:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction submitform(){\\nvar url = \\'/rawman\\';\\nvar pars = \\'username=\\' + escape($F(\\'username\\')) + \\'&secret=\\' + escape($F(\\'password\\'));\\nvar myAjax = new Ajax.Request( url,\\n{ method: \\'get\\',\\nparameters: pars,\\nonComplete: dosomething\\n});\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nNot only is this code much shorter, you don\\'t have to write browser-specific code in\\nyour web pages; Prototype takes care of the differences between Mozilla/Firefox and\\nthe various versions of Internet Explorer. Furthermore, it takes care of testing the request\\'s readyState, so you leave that annoying if statement out of your handler.\\nPrototype has lots of built-in functions, some of which have been extensively used in\\nthe Asterisk framework. There\\'s no room to discuss them here, but for more information, see the Short Cuts Prototype Quick Reference by Scott Raymond and\\nPrototype and Scriptaculous: Taking the Pain Out of JavaScript by Chris Angus, both\\nfrom O\\'Reilly.\\n\\nCustomization of the GUI\\nNow that we\\'ve explored the different pieces that form the foundation of the Asterisk\\nGUI, we have what we need to be able to explore the GUI itself and modify it to fit our\\nneeds. To get to the Asterisk GUI, go to the following address in your browser: http://\\nlocalhost:8088/asterisk/static/config/cfgbasic.html.\\nLooking at Figure 11-1 might lead you to conclude that the Asterisk GUI is simply one\\nmore Asterisk GUI in an already crowded space. Nothing could be further from the\\ntruth. This GUI doesn\\'t just allow you to tweak it, it practically begs you to. In this\\nsection we are going to discuss how you can modify the GUI and use AJAM to build\\nyour own extensions to the GUI. In order to benefit the most from this information,\\nyou need some HTML and JavaScript knowledge.\\nThe GUI home page is named cfgbasic.html. All other pages are loaded into the iframe\\ncontained within the cfgbasic.html page. By default, cfgbasic.html loads home.html into\\nthe main frame.\\nFor most changes to the GUI, you\\'ll eventually need to modify cfgbasic.html, which is\\nthe login screen.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 257\\n\\x0cFigure 11-1. A screenshot of the Asterisk GUI\\n\\nAdding a new tab to the GUI\\nAs an example of customizing the Asterisk GUI, let\\'s create a new tab that displays the\\ncontents of extensions.conf. First, we need to create a file and put it in the /var/lib/\\nasterisk/static-html/config directory. In this example, we\\'ll name the file test.html:\\n<script src=\"scripts/prototype.js\"></script>\\n<script src=\"scripts/astman.js\"></script>\\n<script>\\nfunction localAjaxinit() {\\nparent.loadscreen(this);\\nmakerequest(\\'g\\',\\'extensions.conf\\', \\'\\' , function(t){\\n$(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t + \"</PRE>\";\\n});\\n}\\n</script>\\n<body onload=\"localAjaxinit()\" bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\">\\n<div id=\"ExtensionsDotConf\"></div>\\n</body>\\n\\nThis code simply displays the configuration of the extensions.conf file. Obviously it\\'s a\\nvery simple example, but it shows the fundamentals of creating a new page for the\\nAsterisk GUI. Let\\'s walk through the example step by step.\\nThe first line tells the browser to load the Prototype library. The second line tells the\\nbrowser to load the astman.js file, which contains much of the code designed to interact\\nwith the Manager interface.\\n\\n258 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cNext, we define a function called localAjaxinit. The localAjaxinit function first tells\\nthis page\\'s parent (cfgbasic.html in this case) to run the loadscreen function, passing in\\nthis page as the parameter. This causes the main GUI screen to load our new\\ntest.html inside the iframe. The second thing we do inside the localAjaxinit function\\nis to use the makerequest function. The makerequest function is defined in astman.js and\\nmakes it very convenient to make requests to the web server.\\nThe first parameter of the makerequest function specifies what type of request is being\\nmade. It can be set to any of the following:\\n\\'g\\'\\n\\nUse the GetConfig action to retrieve the configuration from the configuration file\\nspecified in the second parameter.\\n\\'u\\'\\n\\nUse the UpdateConfig action to update the configuration in the configuration file\\nspecified in the second parameter. The third parameter to the function specifies\\nthe configuration data that should be updated.\\n\\'\\'\\n\\nIf the first parameter to the makerequest function is a set of single quotes, then the\\ncustom action specified in the third parameter will be sent.\\nThe fourth parameter is the callback function that will be called with the response to\\nthe Ajax request.\\n\\nExamples of Using makerequest\\nAs an example, the following code snippet shows three different ways to use the\\nmakerequest function. In the first, we\\'ll get the configuration data from users.conf. In\\nthe second, we\\'ll update musiconhold.conf and change the value of the random setting\\nin the default class. Last but not least, we\\'ll call the Ping action. Each of them sets a\\ncallback function named t that simply replaces the contents of the div with the response\\nof the Ajax call.\\nmakerequest( \\'g\\', \\'users.conf\\', \\'\\' ,\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\nmakerequest( \\'u\\', \\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\nmakerequest( \\'\\', \\'\\', \\'action=Ping\\' ,\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\n\\n In reality, makerequest is a simple wrapper around a call to Prototype\\'s Ajax.Request method.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 259\\n\\x0cThe rest of our test.html simply contains an HTML body with a div element, which is\\nwhere we\\'ll place the configuration data when we get it. Note that the HTML body tag\\nhas an onload attribute, which causes the browser to execute the localAjaxinit function\\nonce the page has finished loading.\\nNow that we\\'ve created a new page, we need to edit cfgbasic.html to add this page as\\na panel in the GUI. Open cfgbasic.html and search for a JavaScript function named\\nreturnpanels and insert this code in the list of panels, where you would like your panel\\nto appear:\\nnewpanel( [\"Test\", \"test.html\", \"Test\"]);\\n\\nNow reload the GUI in your browser. You should see a new tab on the lefthand side\\nnamed Test that displays the configuration values for extensions.conf when clicked.\\nWhile there\\'s a lot more to learn about the AJAM interface and the Asterisk GUI, this\\nexample should show just how easy it is to add new functionality to the GUI. In this\\nnext example, we\\'ll show how simple it is to expose a setting from the configuration\\nfiles in the GUI.\\n\\nExposing configuration settings in the GUI\\nAs explained earlier, one of the unique benefits of the Asterisk GUI over the other\\ngraphical frontends to Asterisk is that it updates the configuration files in place, taking\\nspecial care not to overwrite or erase any extra settings you might have in your configuration files. To show just how easy it is to expose new settings in the GUI, we\\'ll add\\na simple checkbox to the GUI to make it possible to set the nat setting in users.conf.\\nIf you open the GUI and click on the tab labeled Users, the GUI loads the file named\\nusers.html in the iframe. Let\\'s open up users.html (usually located in /var/lib/asterisk/\\nstatic-http/config) and begin modifying it to add our checkbox.\\nFirst, search near the top of the file where a variable named fieldnames is defined. This\\nvariable contains a list of all of the field names that will be set by this page of the GUI.\\nSimply add nat to the end of the list, or add the following line directly below the current\\ndefinition for fieldnames.\\nfieldnames.push(\\'nat\\');\\n\\nThis tells the Asterisk GUI that we want to be able to see the value of nat and to be able\\nto set it as well. In order to see or set the value, however, we need to add an element to\\nthe HTML form. To do that, search users.html for the IAX checkbox, and add the\\nfollowing lines between it and the CTI checkbox.\\n<tr>\\n<td align=right><input type=\\'checkbox\\' id=\\'nat\\'></td>\\n<td>NAT</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\nSimply reload the page, and that\\'s all there is to it. With just a few lines of additional\\ncode, we\\'re able to expose the nat setting to the GUI. It couldn\\'t be much simpler!\\n260 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cAs you\\'re developing for the Asterisk GUI, you\\'ll probably find that\\ndebugging Ajax and JavaScript code can be somewhat difficult at times.\\nWe strongly suggest you make use of an extension to Mozilla Firefox\\nnamed Firebug that greatly simplifies the task of debugging Ajax, JavaScript, and HTML. Check it out at http://www.getfirebug.com. There is\\nalso a scaled-down version for Internet Explorer known as Firebug Lite,\\nwhich is available for download at the same web site.\\n\\nFor More Information\\nOver the course of this chapter, we\\'ve introduced you to the Asterisk GUI and the\\nAJAM framework. We\\'ve covered the architecture of how the GUI works, and how to\\nmodify the GUI. If you would like more information on developing a graphical interface\\nfor Asterisk, please refer to the GUI Developers Guide located at http://asterisknow.org/\\ndevelopers/gui-guide.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 261\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nRelational Database Integration\\n\\nFew things are harder to put up with than the annoyance\\nof a good example.\\n--Mark Twain\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn this chapter we are going to explore integrating some Asterisk features and functions\\ninto a database. There are several databases available for Linux, but we have chosen to\\nlimit our discussion to PostgreSQL. While we acknowledge MySQL is also an extremely\\npopular database, we had to choose one, and our experience with PostgreSQL tipped\\nthe scale in its favor. All that having been said, what we are actually going to be doing\\nis discussing the ODBC connector, so as long has you have familiarity with getting your\\nfavorite database ODBC-ready, the substance of this chapter will apply to you.\\nIntegrating Asterisk with databases is one of the fundamental elements allowing clustering of Asterisk into a large, distributed system. By utilizing the power of the database,\\ndynamically changing data can convey information across an array of Asterisk systems.\\nOur newest favorite Asterisk function is func_odbc, which we will cover later in this\\nchapter.\\nWhile not all Asterisk deployments will require a relational database, understanding\\nhow to harness them opens the lid of a treasure chest full of new ways to design your\\ntelecom solution.\\n\\nInstalling the Database\\nThe first thing to do is to install the PostgreSQL database server:*\\n# yum install -y postgresql-server\\n* On a large, busy system you will want to install this on a completely separate box from your Asterisk system.\\n\\n\\x0cThen start the database, which will take a few seconds to initialize for the first time:\\n# service postgresql start\\n\\nNext, create a user called asterisk, which we will use to connect to and manage the\\ndatabase. Run the following commands:\\n# su - postgres\\n$ createuser -P\\nEnter name of user\\nEnter password for\\nEnter it again:\\nShall the new role\\nShall the new user\\nShall the new user\\nCREATE USER\\n\\nto add: asterisk\\nnew user:\\nbe a superuser? (y/n) n\\nbe allowed to create databases? (y/n) y\\nbe allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n\\n\\nBy default, PostgreSQL does not listen on the TCP/IP connection, which Asterisk will\\nbe using. We need to modify the /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf file in order to allow\\nAsterisk to make IP connections to the database. To do this, simply remove the comment from the beginning of the tcpip_socket and port parameters. Be sure to change\\nthe tcpip_socket option from false to true.\\ntcpip_socket = true max_connections = 100\\n# note: increasing max_connections costs about 500 bytes of shared\\n# memory per connection slot, in addition to costs from shared_buffers\\n# and max_locks_per_transaction.\\n#superuser_reserved_connections = 2\\nport = 5432\\n\\nNow, edit the /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf file in order to allow the asterisk user we\\njust created to connect to the PostgreSQL server over the TCP/IP socket. At the end of\\nthe file, replace everything below # Put your actual configuration here with the following:\\nhost\\nlocal\\n\\nall\\nall\\n\\nasterisk\\nasterisk\\n\\n\\n\\ntrust\\n\\nNow we can create the database that we will use throughout this chapter. We\\'re going\\nto create a database called asterisk and set the owner to our asterisk user.\\n$ createdb --owner=asterisk asterisk\\nCREATE DATABASE\\n\\nRestart the PostgreSQL server after exiting from the postgres user back to root:\\n$ exit\\n# service postgresql restart\\n\\nWe can verify our connection to the PostgreSQL server via TCP/IP like so:\\n# psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U asterisk Password:\\nWelcome to psql 7.4.16, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.\\nType:\\n\\n\\\\copyright for distribution terms\\n\\\\h for help with SQL commands\\n\\n264 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0c\\\\? for help on internal slash commands\\n\\\\g or terminate with semicolon to execute query\\n\\\\q to quit\\nasterisk=>\\n\\nDouble-check your configuration as discussed earlier if you get the following error,\\nwhich means connections via the TCP/IP socket are not allowed:\\npsql: could not connect to server: Connection refused\\nIs the server running on host \"127.0.0.1\" and accepting\\nTCP/IP connections on port 5432?\\n\\nInstalling and Configuring ODBC\\nThe ODBC connector is a database abstraction layer that makes it possible for Asterisk\\nto communicate with a wide range of databases without requiring the developers to\\ncreate a separate database connector for every database Asterisk wants to support. This\\nsaves a lot of development effort and code maintenance. There is a slight performance\\ncost to this because we are adding another application layer between Asterisk and the\\ndatabase. However, this can be mitigated with proper design and is well worth it when\\nyou need powerful, flexible database capabilities in your Asterisk system.\\nBefore we install the connector in Asterisk, we have to install ODBC into Linux itself.\\nTo install the ODBC drivers, simply run the command:\\n# yum install -y unixODBC unixODBC-devel libtool-ltdl libtool-ltdl-devel\\n\\nSee Chapter 3 for the matrix of packages you should have installed.\\n\\nWe need to install the unixODBC-devel package because it is used by Asterisk to create\\nthe ODBC modules we will be using throughout this chapter.\\nVerify that you have the PostgreSQL ODBC driver configured in the /etc/odbcinst.ini\\nfile. It should look something like this:\\n[PostgreSQL]\\nDescription\\nDriver\\nSetup\\nFileUsage\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\nODBC for PostgreSQL\\n/usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so\\n/usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so\\n\\nVerify the system is able to see the driver by running the following command. It should\\nreturn the label name PostgreSQL if all is well.\\n# odbcinst -q -d\\n[PostgreSQL]\\n\\nInstalling and Configuring ODBC | 265\\n\\x0cNext, configure the /etc/odbc.ini file, which is used to create an identifier that Asterisk\\nwill use to reference this configuration. If at any point in the future you need to change\\nthe database to something else, you simply need to reconfigure this file, allowing Asterisk to continue to point to the same place.\\n[asterisk-connector]\\nDescription\\n=\\nDriver\\n=\\nDatabase\\n=\\nServername\\n=\\nUserName\\n=\\nPassword\\n=\\nPort\\n=\\nProtocol\\n=\\nReadOnly\\n=\\nRowVersioning\\n=\\nShowSystemTables\\n=\\nShowOidColumn\\n=\\nFakeOidIndex\\n=\\nConnSettings\\n=\\n\\nPostgreSQL connection to \\'asterisk\\' database\\nPostgreSQL\\nasterisk\\nlocalhost\\nasterisk\\nwelcome\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\n\\nLet\\'s verify that we can connect to our database using the isql application. The isql\\napplication will not perform the connect as the root user, and must be run as the same\\nowner as the database. Since the owner of the asterisk database under PostgreSQL is\\nthe asterisk user, we must create a Linux account with the same name. In Chapter 14,\\nwe will take advantage of this user to run Asterisk as non-root.\\n# su - asterisk\\n$ echo \"select 1\" | isql -v asterisk-connector\\n+---------------------------------------+\\n| Connected!\\n|\\n|\\n|\\n| sql-statement\\n|\\n| help [tablename]\\n|\\n| quit\\n|\\n|\\n|\\n+---------------------------------------+\\nSQL> +------------+\\n| ?column?\\n|\\n+------------+\\n|\\n+------------+\\nSQLRowCount returns 1\\n1 rows fetched\\n$ exit\\n\\nWith unixODBC installed, configured, and verified to work, we need to recompile\\nAsterisk so that the ODBC modules are created and installed. Change back to your\\n\\n Yes, this is excessively verbose. The only entries you really need are Driver, Database, and Servername. Even\\n\\nthe Username and Password are specified elsewhere, as seen later.\\n\\n266 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAsterisk sources directory and run the ./configure script so it knows you have installed\\nunixODBC.\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake distclean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake install\\n\\nAlmost everything in this chapter is turned on by default. You will want\\nto run make menuselect to verify that the ODBC related modules are\\nenabled. These include cdr_odbc, func_odbc, func_realtime,\\npbx_realtime, res_config_odbc, res_odbc. For voicemail stored in an\\nODBC database, be sure to select ODBC_STORAGE from the Voicemail\\nBuild Options menu. You can verify the modules exist in the /usr/lib/\\nasterisk/modules/ directory.\\n\\nConfiguring res_odbc for Access to Our Database\\nODBC connections are configured in the res_odbc.conf file located in /etc/asterisk. The\\nres_odbc.conf file sets the parameters that the various Asterisk modules will use to\\nconnect to the database.\\nModify the res_odbc.conf file:\\n[asterisk]\\nenabled => yes\\ndsn => asterisk-connector\\nusername => asterisk\\npassword => welcome\\npooling => no\\nlimit => 0\\npre-connect => yes\\n\\nThe dsn option points at the database connection we configured in /etc/odbc.ini, and\\nthe pre-connect option tells Asterisk to open up and maintain a connection to the\\ndatabase when loading the res_odbc.so module. This lowers some of the overhead that\\nwould come from repeatedly setting up and tearing down the connection to the\\ndatabase.\\nOnce you\\'ve configured res_odbc.conf, start Asterisk and verify the database connection with the odbc show CLI command:\\n*CLI> odbc show\\nName: asterisk\\nDSN: asterisk-connector\\n The pooling and limit options are quite useful for MS SQL Server and Sybase databases. These permit you\\n\\nto establish multiple connections (up to limit connections) to a database while ensuring that each connection\\nhas only one statement executing at once (this is due to a limitation in the protocol used by these database\\nservers).\\n\\nInstalling and Configuring ODBC | 267\\n\\x0cPooled: no\\nConnected: yes\\n\\nUsing Realtime\\nThe Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) is a method of storing the configuration files\\n(that would normally be found in /etc/asterisk) and their configuration options in a\\ndatabase table. There are two types of realtime; static and dynamic. The static version\\nis similar to the traditional method of reading a configuration file, except that the data\\nis read from the database instead. The dynamic realtime method is used for things such\\nas user and peer objects (SIP, IAX2), and voicemail which loads and updates the information as it is required. Changes to static information requires a reload just as if you\\nhad changed the text file on the system, but dynamic information is polled by Asterisk\\nas needed and requires no reload. Realtime is configured in the extconfig.conf file located in the /etc/asterisk directory. This file tells Asterisk what to load from the database\\nand where to load it from, allowing certain files to be loaded from the database and\\nother files to be loaded from the standard configuration files.\\n\\nStatic Realtime\\nStatic realtime is used when you want to store the configuration that you would normally place in the configuration files in /etc/asterisk but want to load from a database.\\nThe same rules that apply to flat files on your system still apply when using static\\nrealtime, such as requiring you to either run the reload command from the Asterisk\\nCLI, or to reload the module associated with the configuration file (i.e., module reload\\nchan_sip.so).\\n\\nUsing the preload Directive\\nMost files are able to be loaded via static realtime, but a few files are not able to be\\nloaded using this method. These include asterisk.conf, extconfig.conf, and logger.conf.\\nAdditionally, the files manager.conf, cdr.conf, and rtp.conf cannot be loaded from static\\nrealtime unless the storage drivers are loaded before the main Asterisk core initializes\\n(this is because the configuration files need to be loaded by realtime before the module\\ngoes to read its configuration). Since we are using ODBC in this chapter, we would\\nneed to add the following lines to modules.conf:\\n; /etc/asterisk/modules.conf\\npreload => res_odbc.so\\npreload => res_config_odbc.so\\n\\n268 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cWhen using static realtime, we tell Asterisk which files we want to load from the database using the following syntax in the extconfig.conf file:\\n; /etc/asterisk/extconfig.conf\\nfilename.conf => driver,database[,table]\\n\\nIf the table name is not specified, then Asterisk will use the name of the\\nfile instead.\\n\\nThe static realtime module uses a specifically formatted table to read the configuration\\nof static files in from the database. You can define the table for static realtime in PostgreSQL as follows:\\nCREATE TABLE ast_config\\n(\\nid serial NOT NULL,\\ncat_metric int4 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nvar_metric int4 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nfilename varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\ncategory varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'default\\'::character varying,\\nvar_name varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\nvar_val varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\ncommented int2 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nCONSTRAINT ast_config_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nA brief explanation about the columns is required in order to understand how Asterisk\\ntakes the rows from the database and applies them to the configuration for the various\\nmodules you may load:\\ncat_metric\\n\\nThe weight of the category within the file. A lower metric means it appears higher\\nin the file (see the sidebar \"A Word About Metrics\").\\nvar_metric\\n\\nThe weight of an item within a category. A lower metric means it appears higher\\nin the list. This is useful for things like codec order in sip.conf or iax.conf where\\nyou want disallow=all to appear first (metric of 0), followed by allow=ulaw (metric\\nof 1), then by allow=gsm (metric of 2) (see the sidebar \"A Word About Metrics\").\\nfilename\\n\\nThe filename the module would normally read from the hard drive of your system\\n(i.e., musiconhold.conf, sip.conf, iax.conf, etc.).\\ncategory\\n\\nThe section name within the file, such as [general], but don\\'t save to the database\\nusing the square brackets.\\n\\nUsing Realtime | 269\\n\\x0cvar_name\\n\\nThe option on the left side of the equals sign (i.e., disallow is the var_name in\\ndisallow=all).\\nvar_val\\n\\nThe value to an option on the right side of the equals sign (i.e., all is the var_val\\nin disallow=all).\\ncommented\\n\\nAny value other than 0 will evaluate as if it were prefixed with a semicolon in the\\nflat file (commented out).\\n\\nA Word About Metrics\\nThe metrics in static realtime are used to control the order that objects are read into\\nmemory. Think of the cat_metric and var_metric as the original line numbers in the\\nflat file. A higher cat_metric is processed first (because Asterisk matches categories from\\nbottom to topthis is why the order of users and peers can matter in sip.conf or\\niax.conf). A lower var_metric is processed first within the category because Asterisk will\\nprocess the order of options top-down within the category (e.g., disallow=all should\\nbe set to a value lower than the allow\\'s value within the category to make sure it is\\nprocessed first).\\n\\nA simple file we can load from static realtime is the musiconhold.conf file. Let\\'s start by\\nmoving this file to a temporary location:\\n# cd /etc/asterisk\\n# mv musiconhold.conf musiconhold.conf.old\\n\\nIn order for the classes to be removed from memory, we need to restart Asterisk. Then\\nwe can verify our classes are blank by running moh show classes:\\n*CLI> restart now\\n*CLI> moh show classes\\n*CLI>\\n\\nSo let\\'s put the [default] class back into Asterisk, but now we\\'ll load it from the database. Connect to PostgreSQL and execute the following INSERT statements:\\nINSERT\\nVALUES\\nINSERT\\nVALUES\\n\\nINTO ast_config (filename,category,var_name,var_val)\\n(\\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\'general\\',\\'mode\\',\\'files\\');\\nINTO ast_config (filename,category,var_name,var_val)\\n(\\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\'general\\',\\'directory\\',\\'/var/lib/asterisk/moh\\');\\n\\nYou can verify your values have made it into the database by running a SELECT statement:\\nasterisk=# select filename,category,var_name,var_val from ast_config;\\nfilename\\n| category\\n| var_name\\n| var_val\\n------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------------musiconhold.conf | general\\n| mode\\n| files\\n\\n270 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cmusiconhold.conf | general\\n\\n| directory\\n\\n| /var/lib/asterisk/moh\\n\\nAnd now, there\\'s just one last thing to modify in the extconfig.conf file in /etc/asterisk\\ndirectory to tell Asterisk to get the data for musiconhold.conf from the database. Add\\nthe following line to the end of the extconfig.conf file, then save it:\\nmusiconhold.conf => odbc,asterisk,ast_config\\n\\nThen connect to the Asterisk console and perform a reload:\\n*CLI> module reload\\n\\nYou can now verify that we have our music-on-hold classes loading from the database\\nby running moh show classes:\\n*CLI> moh show classes\\nClass: general\\nMode: files\\nDirectory: /var/lib/asterisk/moh\\n\\nAnd there you go; musiconhold.conf loaded from the database. You can perform the\\nsame steps in order to load other flat files from the database!\\n\\nDynamic Realtime\\nThe dynamic realtime system is used to load objects that may change often: SIP/IAX2\\nusers and peers, queues and their members, and voicemail. Since this information in\\nthe system may either be changing or new records are being added on a regular basis,\\nwe can utilize the power of the database to let us load this information on an as-needed\\nbasis.\\nAll of realtime is configured in the /etc/asterisk/extconfig.conf file, but dynamic realtime\\nhas well-defined configuration names such as sippeers. Defining something like SIP\\npeers is done with the following format:\\n; extconfig.conf\\nsippeers => driver,database[,table]\\n\\nThe table name is optional, in which case Asterisk will use the predefined name (i.e.,\\nsippeers) as the table to look up the data. In our example, we\\'ll be using the ast_sip\\npeers table to store our SIP peer information.\\nRemember that we have both SIP peers and SIP users; peers are endpoints we send calls to, and a user is something we receive calls from.\\nA friend is shorthand that defines both.\\n\\nSo to configure Asterisk to load all SIP peers from a database using realtime, we would\\ndefine something like:\\n\\nUsing Realtime | 271\\n\\x0c; extconfig.conf\\nsippeers => odbc,asterisk,ast_sipfriends\\n\\nTo also load our SIP users from the database, define it like so:\\nsipusers => odbc,asterisk,ast_sipfriends\\n\\nYou may have noticed we used the same table for both the sippeers and sipusers. This\\nis because there will be a type field (just as if you had defined the type in the sip.conf\\nfile) that will let us define a type of user, peer, or friend. When defining the table for\\nSIP users and peers, we need at least the following:\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n|name |host\\n|secret | ipaddr | port| regseconds | username |\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n|dynamic |welcome|\\n|\\n|\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n\\nThe port, regseconds, and ipaddr fields are required to let Asterisk store the registration\\ninformation for the peer in order to know where to send the call. This is assuming the\\nhost is dynamic; however, if the peer is static, we would have to populate the ipaddr\\nfield ourselves. The port field is optional and would use the default standard port defined in the [general] section, and the regseconds would remain blank.) There are many\\nmore options for a SIP friend that we can define, such as the caller ID, and adding that\\ninformation is as simple as adding the callerid column to the table. See the\\nsip.conf.sample file for more options that can be defined for SIP friends.\\n\\nStoring Call Detail Records\\nCall Detail Records (CDR) contain information about calls that have passed through\\nyour Asterisk system. They are discussed further in Chapter 13. This is a popular use\\nof databases in Asterisk because CDR can be easier to manage if you store the records\\nin a database (for example, you could keep track of many Asterisk systems in a single\\ntable).\\n\\nSetting the systemname for Globally Unique IDs\\nCDRs consist of a unique identifier and several fields of information about the call\\n(including source and destination channel, length of call, last application executed and\\nso forth). In a clustered set of Asterisk boxes, it is theoretically possible to have duplication among unique identifiers since each Asterisk system considers only itself. To\\naddress this, we can automatically append a system identifier to the front of the unique\\nID by adding an option to /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf. For each of your boxes, set an\\nidentifier by adding something like:\\n[options]\\nsystemname=toronto\\n\\n272 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cLet\\'s create a table in our database to store CDR. Log in to the PostgreSQL server with\\nthe psql application:\\n# psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\nAnd create the asterisk_cdr table:\\nasterisk=> CREATE TABLE asterisk_cdr\\n(\\nid bigserial NOT NULL,\\ncalldate timestamptz,\\nCONSTRAINT asterisk_cdr_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nYou can verify the table was created by using the \\\\dt command (describe tables):\\nasterisk=> \\\\dt asterisk_cdr\\nList of relations\\nSchema |\\nName\\n| Type | Owner\\n--------+--------------+-------+---------public | asterisk_cdr | table | asterisk\\n\\nNext, configure Asterisk to store its CDR into the database. This is done in the /etc/\\nasterisk/cdr_odbc.conf file with the following configuration:\\n[global]\\ndsn=asterisk-connector\\nusername=asterisk\\npassword=welcome\\nloguniqueid=yes\\ntable=asterisk_cdr\\n\\nStoring Call Detail Records | 273\\n\\x0cIf Asterisk is already running, from the Asterisk CLI execute module reload\\ncdr_odbc.so.

The easiest way to test a call is with the Asterisk CLI command console\\ndial (assuming that you have a sound card and chan_oss installed). However, you can\\nutilize any method at your disposal to place a test call:\\n*CLI> console dial 100@default\\n-- Executing [100@default:1] Playback(\"OSS/dsp\", \"tt-weasels\") in new stack\\n-- <OSS/dsp> Playing \\'tt-weasels\\' (language \\'en\\')\\n\\nThen connect to the database and perform a SELECT statement to verify you have data\\nin the asterisk_cdr table. You could also do SELECT * FROM asterisk_cdr;, but that\\nwill return a lot more data:\\n# psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\nasterisk=> SELECT id,dst,channel,uniqueid,calldate FROM asterisk_cdr;\\nid | dst | channel |\\nuniqueid\\n|\\ncalldate\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking\\nThe func_odbc dialplan function is arguably the coolest and most powerful dialplan\\nfunction in Asterisk. It allows you to create and use fairly simple dialplan functions that\\nretrieve and use information from databases directly in the dialplan. There are all kinds\\nof ways in which this might be used, such as managing users or allowing sharing of\\ndynamic information within a clustered set of Asterisk machines.\\nWhat func_odbc allows you to do is define SQL queries to which you assign function\\nnames. In effect, you are creating custom functions that obtain their results by executing\\nqueries against a database. The func_odbc.conf file is where you specify the relationship\\nbetween the function names you create and the SQL statements you wish them to\\nperform. By referring to the named function in the dialplan, you can retrieve and update\\nvalues in the database.\\n274 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cWhile using an external script to interact with a database (from which\\na flat file is created that Asterisk would read) has advantages (if the\\ndatabase went down, your system would continue to function and the\\nscript would simply not update any files until connectivity to the database was restored), a major disadvantage is that any changes you make\\nto a user are not available until you run the update script. This is probably not a big issue on small systems, but on large systems, waiting for\\nchanges to take effect can cause issues, such as pausing a live call while\\na large file is loaded and parsed.\\nYou can relieve some of this by utilizing a replicated database system.\\nIn the version of Asterisk following 1.4 (currently trunk), the syntax of\\nthe func_odbc.conf file changes slightly, but gives the ability to failover\\nto another database system. This way you can cluster the database\\nbackend utilizing a master-master relationship (pgcluster; Slony-II), or\\na master-slave (Slony-I) replication system.\\n\\nIn order to get you into the right frame of mind for what follows, we want you to picture\\na Dagwood sandwich.\\nCan you relay the total experience of such a thing by showing someone a picture of a\\ntomato, or by waving a slice of cheese about? Not hardly. That is the conundrum we\\nfaced when trying to give a useful example of why func_odbc is so powerful. So, we\\ndecided to build the whole sandwich for you. It\\'s quite a mouthful, but after a few bites\\nof this, peanut butter and jelly is never going to be the same.\\nFor our example, we decided to implement something that we think could have some\\npractical uses. Let\\'s picture a small company with a sales force of five people who have\\nto share two desks. This is not as cruel as it seems, because these folks spend most of\\ntheir time on the road, and they are each only in the office for at most one day each week.\\nStill, when they do get into the office, they\\'d like the system to know which desk they\\nare sitting at, so that their calls can be directed there. Also, the boss wants to be able\\nto track when they are in the office, and control calling privileges from those phones\\nwhen no one is there.\\nThis need is typically solved by what is called a hot-desking feature, so we have built\\none for you in order to show you the power of func_odbc.\\nLets start with the easy stuff, and create two desktop phones in the sip.conf file.\\n; sip.conf\\n; HOT DESK USERS\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=hotdesk\\n And if you don\\'t know what a Dagwood is, that\\'s what Wikipedia is for. I am not that old.\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 275\\n\\x0cqualify=yes\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=hotdesk\\nqualify=yes\\n; END HOT DESK USERS\\n\\nThese two desk phones both enter the dialplan at the [hotdesk] context in exten\\nsions.conf. If you want to have these devices actually work, you will of course need to\\nset the appropriate parameters in the devices themselves, but we\\'ve covered all that in\\nChapter 4.\\nThat\\'s all for sip.conf. We\\'ve got two slices of bread. Hardly a sandwich yet.\\nNow let\\'s get the database part of it set up (we are assuming that you have an ODBC\\ndatabase created and working as outlined in the earlier parts of this chapter). First,\\nconnect to the database console like so:\\n# su - postgres\\n$ psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\nThen create the table with the following bit of code:\\nCREATE TABLE ast_hotdesk\\n(\\nid serial NOT NULL,\\nfirst_name text,\\nlast_name text,\\ncid_name text,\\ncontext text,\\nstatus bool DEFAULT false,\\n\"location\" text,\\nCONSTRAINT ast_hotdesk_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nAfter that, we populated the database with the following information (some of the\\nvalues that you see actually would change only after the dialplan work is done, but we\\nhave it in here by way of example). At the PostgreSQL console, run the following\\ncommands:\\nasterisk=> INSERT INTO ast_hotdesk (\\'extension\\', \\'first_name\\', \\'last_name\\', \\'cid_name\\',\\n\\'cid_number\\', \\'pin\\', \\'context\\', \\'location\\') \\\\\\nVALUES (1101, \\'Leif\\', \\'Madsen\\', \\'Leif Madsen\\', \\'4165551101\\', \\'555\\', \\'longdistance\\',\\n\\n276 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cRepeat the previous line and change the VALUES for all entries you wish to have in the\\ndatabase. You can view the data in the ast_hotdesk table by running a simple SELECT\\nstatement from the PostgreSQL console:\\nasterisk=> SELECT * FROM ast_hostdesk;\\n\\nwhich would give you something like the following output:\\n| id | extension | first_name | last_name\\n| cid_name\\n| cid_number\\n| pin\\n| \"Leif\"\\n| \"Madsen\"\\n| \"Leif Madsen\"\\n| \"Jim\"\\n| \"Van Meggelen\" | \"Jim Van Meggelen\" | \"4165551102\" | \"556\"\\n| \"Jared\"\\n| \"Smith\"\\n| \"Jared Smith\"\\n| \"Mark\"\\n| \"Spencer\"\\n| \"Mark Spencer\"\\n| \"Kevin\"\\n| \"Fleming\"\\n| \"Kevin Fleming\"\\n| context\\n| status | location |$\\n+-----------------+---------+----------+\\n| \"longdistance\" | \"TRUE\" | \"desk_1\" |\\n| \"longdistance\" | \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"local\"\\n| \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"international\" | \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"local\"\\n| \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n\\nWe\\'ve got the condiments now, so let\\'s get to our dialplan. This is where the magic is\\ngoing to happen.\\nBefore you start typing, take note that we have placed all of the sample\\ntext that follows in appendix H, so while we encourage you to follow\\nus along through the examples, you can also see what it all looks like as\\na whole, by checking the appendix (and by copying and pasting, if you\\nhave an electronic version of this book).\\n\\nSomewhere in extensions.conf we are going to have to create the [hotdesk] context. To\\nstart, let\\'s define a pattern-match extension that will allow the users to log in:\\n; extensions.conf\\n; Hot Desking Feature\\n[hotdesk]\\n; Hot Desk Login\\nexten => _110[1-5],1,NoOp()\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Verbose(1|Hot Desk Extension ${E} is changing status)\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Verbose(1|Checking current status of extension ${E})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\n\\nWe\\'re not done writing this extension yet, but let\\'s pause for a moment and see where\\nwe\\'re at so far.\\nWhen a sales agent sits down at a desk, they log in by dialing their own extension\\nnumber. In this case we have allowed the 1101 through 1105 extensions to log in with\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 277\\n\\x0cour pattern match of _110[1-5]. You could just as easily make this less restrictive by\\nusing _11XX (allowing 1100 through 1199). This extension uses func_odbc to perform\\na lookup with the HOTDESK_INFO() dialplan function (which we will be creating shortly).\\nThis custom function (which we define in the func_odbc.conf file) performs an SQL\\nstatement and returns whatever is retrieved from the database.\\nWe would define the new function HOTDESK_INFO() in func_odbc.conf like so:\\n[INFO]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nread=SELECT ${ARG1} FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE extension = \\'${ARG2}\\'\\n\\nThat\\'s a lot of stuff in just a few lines. Let\\'s quickly cover them before we move on.\\nFirst of all, the prefix is optional. If you don\\'t configure the prefix, then Asterisk adds\\n\"ODBC\" to the name of the function (in this case INFO), which means this function\\nwould become ODBC_INFO(). This is not very descriptive of what the function is doing,\\nso it can be helpful to assign a prefix that helps to relate your ODBC functions to the\\ntask they are performing. In this case we chose HOTDESK, which means that this\\ncustom function will be named HOTDESK_INFO.\\nThe dsn attribute tells Asterisk which connection to use from res_odbc.conf. Since several database connections could be configured in res_odbc.conf, we specify which one\\nto use here. In Figure 12-1, we show the relationship between the various file configurations and how they reference down the chain to connect to the database.\\nWe then define our SQL statement with the read attribute. Dialplan functions have two\\ndifferent formats that they can be called with: one for retrieving information, and one\\nfor setting information. The read attribute is used when we call the HOTDESK_INFO()\\nfunction with the retrieve format (and we could execute a separate SQL statement with\\nthe write attribute; we\\'ll discuss the format for the write attribute a little bit later in\\nthis chapter).\\nReading values from this function would take the format in the dialplan like so:\\nexten => s,n,Set(RETURNED_VALUE=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,1101)})\\n\\nThis would return the value located in the database within the status column where\\nthe extension column equals 1101. The status and 1101 we pass to the\\nHOTDESK_INFO() function are then placed into the SQL statement we assigned to the\\nread attribute, available as ${ARG1} and ${ARG2}, respectively. If we had passed a third\\noption, this would have been available as ${ARG3}.\\n\\n278 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\nfunc_odbc.conf\\n[INFO]\\nprefix=hotdesk\\ndsn=asterisk\\nreadsql=...\\n\\nLinux\\n\\nres_odbc.conf\\n\\n[asterisk]\\nenabled=>yes\\ndsn=>PostgreSQL-asterisk\\npre-connect=>yes\\n\\n/etc/odbc/ini\\n\\ndatabase\\n\\n[PostgreSQL-asterisk]\\nDescription =Aserisk pgsql connection\\nServername =localhost\\n\\nFigure 12-1. Relationships between func_odbc.conf, res_odbc.conf, /etc/odbc.ini (unixODBC), and\\nthe database connection\\nBe sure that your data is unique enough that you only get a single row\\nback. If more than one row is returned, Asterisk will see only the first\\nrow returned. With PostgreSQL, you could add a LIMIT 1 to the end\\nof your SQL statement to limit a single row being returned, but this is\\nnot a good practice to rely on. A little further into this section we\\'ll see\\nhow we can use the LIMIT and OFFSET PostgreSQL functions to loop\\nthrough multiple rows of data!\\n\\nAfter the SQL statement is executed, the value returned (if any) is assigned to the\\nRETURNED_VALUE channel variable.\\n\\nUsing the ARRAY() function\\nIn our example, we are utilizing two separate database calls and assigning those values\\nto a pair of channel variables, (${E}_STATUS and ${E}_PIN). This was done to simplify\\nthe example:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\n\\nAs an alternative, we could have returned multiple columns and saved them to separate\\nvariables utilizing the ARRAY() dialplan function. If we had defined our SQL statement\\nin the func_odbc.conf file like so:\\nread=SELECT pin,status FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE extension = \\'${E}\\'\\n\\nthen we could use the ARRAY() function to save each column of information for the row\\nto its own variable with a single call to the database:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(ARRAY(${E}_PIN,${E}_STATUS)=${HOTDESK_INFO(${E})})\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 279\\n\\x0cSo, in the first two lines of our following block of code we are passing the value\\nstatus, and the value contained in the ${E} variable (e.g., 1101) to the HOTDESK_INFO\\n() function. The two values are then replaced in the SQL statement with ${ARG1} and\\n${ARG2}, respectfully, the SQL statement is executed, and the value returned is assigned\\nto the ${E}_STATUS channel variable.\\nOK, let\\'s finish writing the pattern-match extension now:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${${E}_STATUS})}]?invalid_user,1)\\n; check if ${E}_STATUS is NULL\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${${E}_STATUS} = 1]?logout,1:login,1)\\n\\nAfter assigning the value of the status column to the ${E}_STATUS variable (if you dialed\\nextension 1101, then the variable name would be 1101_STATUS), we check if we received\\na value back from the database (error checking). We make use of the ISNULL() function\\nto perform this check.\\nThe last row in the block checks the status of the phone, and if currently logged in, will\\nlog off the agent. If not already logged in, it will go to extension login, priority 1 within\\nthe same context.\\nIn the version following 1.4 (currently trunk) you can use the\\n${ODBCROWS} channel variable with statements executed by a readsql.\\nWe could have replaced the GotoIf() with something like:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 0]?invalid_user,1)\\n\\nThe login extension runs some initial checks to verify the pin code entered by the agent.\\nWe allow him three tries to enter the correct pin, and if invalid, will send the call to the\\nlogin_fail extension (which we will be writing later on).\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogin,1,NoOp() ; set counter initial value\\nlogin,n,Set(PIN_TRIES=0) ; set max number of login attempts\\nlogin,n(get_pin),NoOp() ; increase pin try counter\\nlogin,n,Set(PIN_TRIES=$[${PIN_TRIES} + 1])\\nlogin,n,Read(PIN_ENTERED|enter-password|${LEN(${${E}_PIN})})\\nlogin,n,GotoIf($[${PIN_ENTERED} = ${${E}_PIN}]?valid_login,1)\\nlogin,n,Playback(invalid-pin)\\n\\n Remember that in a traditional phone system all extensions must be numbers, but in Asterisk, extensions\\n\\ncan have names as well. A possible advantage of using an extension that\\'s not a number is that it will be much\\nharder for a user to dial it from her phone and, thus, more secure. We\\'re going to use several named extensions\\nin this example. If you want to be absolutely sure that a malicious user cannot access those named extensions,\\nsimply use the trick that the AEL loader uses: start with a priority other than 1.\\n\\n280 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cIf the pin entered matches, we validate the login with the valid_login extension. First\\nwe utilize the CHANNEL variable to figure out which phone device we\\'re calling from. The\\nCHANNEL variable is usually populated with something such as: SIP/desk_1-ab4034c, so\\nwe make use of the CUT() function to first pull off the SIP/ portion of the string and\\nassign that to LOCATION. We then strip off the -ab4034c part of the string, discard it, and\\nassign the remainder of desk_1 to the LOCATION variable.\\nexten\\n; CUT\\nexten\\n; CUT\\nexten\\n\\noff the channel technology and assign to the LOCATION variable\\noff the unique identifier and save the remainder to the LOCATION variable\\n\\nWe utilize yet another custom function, HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_LOGINS(), created in\\nfunc_odbc.conf to check if any other users were previously logged in to this phone and\\nhad forgotten to log out. If the number of previously logged in users was greater than\\n0 (and should only ever be 1, but we check for more anyway and reset those, too), it\\nruns the logic in the logout_login extension.\\nIf no previous agents were logged in, we update the login status for this user with the\\nHOTDESK_STATUS() function:\\nexten => valid_login,n,Set(ARRAY(USERS_LOGGED_IN)=${HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_\\nLOGINS(${LOCATION})})\\nexten => valid_login,n,GotoIf($[${USERS_LOGGED_IN} > 0]?logout_login,1)\\nexten => valid_login,n(set_login_status),NoOp()\\n; Set the status for the phone to \\'1\\' and where we\\'re logged into\\n; NOTE: we need to escape the comma here because the Set() application has arguments\\nexten => valid_login,n,Set(HOTDESK_STATUS(${E})=1\\\\,${LOCATION})\\nexten => valid_login,n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 1]?error,1)\\nexten => valid_login,n,Playback(agent-loginok)\\nexten => valid_login,n,Hangup()\\n\\nWe create a write function in func_odbc.conf like so:\\n[STATUS]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nwrite=UPDATE ast_hotdesk SET status = \\'${VAL1}\\', location = \\'${VAL2}\\' WHERE extension\\n\\nThe syntax is very similar to the read syntax discussed earlier in the chapter, but there\\nare a few new things here, so let\\'s discuss them before moving on.\\nThe first thing you may have noticed is that we now have both ${VALx} and ${ARGx}\\nvariables in our SQL statement. These contain the values we pass to the function from\\nthe dialplan. In this case, we have two VAL variables, and a single ARG variable that were\\nset from the dialplan via this statement:\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 281\\n\\x0cBecause the Set() dialplan application can also take arguments (you can\\nset multiple variables and values by separating them with commas or\\npipes), you need to escape the comma with the backslash ( \\\\ ) so it is\\nnot processed by the expression parser for the Set() application, but\\nrather parses it for the HOTDESK_STATUS() function.\\n\\nNotice the syntax is slightly different from that of the read style function. This signals\\nto Asterisk that you want to perform a write (this is the same syntax as other dialplan\\nfunctions).\\nWe are passing the value of the ${E} variable to the HOTDESK_STATUS() function, whose\\nvalue is then accessible in the SQL statement within func_odbc.conf with the ${ARG1}\\nvariable. We then pass two values: 1 and ${LOCATION}. These are available to the SQL\\nstatement in the ${VAL1} and ${VAL2} variables, respectively.\\nAs mentioned previously, if we had to log out one or more agents before logging in, we\\nwould check this with the logout_login extension. This dialplan logic will utilize the\\nWhile() application to loop through the database and perform any database correction\\nthat may need to occur. More than likely this will execute only one loop, but it\\'s a good\\nexample of how you might update or parse multiple rows in the database:\\nexten\\n; set\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\nall logged in users on this device to logged out status\\n=> logout_login,n,While($[${ROW_COUNTER} < ${USERS_LOGGED_IN}])\\n\\nThe ${USERS_LOGGED_IN} variable was set previously with the HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_LOG\\nINS() function, which assigned a value of 1 or greater. We did this by counting the\\nnumber of rows that were affected:\\n; func_odbc.conf\\n[CHECK_PHONE_LOGINS]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nread=SELECT COUNT(status) FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE status = \\'1\\' AND location = \\'${ARG1}\\'\\n\\nWe then get the extension number of the user that is logged in with the HOTDESK_LOG\\nGED_IN_USER() function. The LOCATION variable is populated with desk_1, which tells us\\nwhich device we want to check on, and the ${ROW_COUNTER} contains which iteration of\\nthe loop we\\'re on. These are both passed as arguments to the dialplan function. The\\nresult is then assigned to the WHO variable:\\nexten => logout_login,n,Set(WHO=${HOTDESK_LOGGED_IN_USER(${LOCATION},${ROW_COUNTER})})\\n\\nThe HOTDESK_LOGGED_IN_USER() function then pulls a specific row out of the database\\nthat corresponds with the iteration of the loops we are trying to process:\\n[LOGGED_IN_USER]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\n\\n282 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cread=SELECT extension FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE status = \\'1\\'\\nAND location = \\'${ARG1}\\' ORDER BY id LIMIT \\'1\\' OFFSET \\'${ARG2}\\'\\n\\nNow that we know what extension we want to update, we write to the HOTDESK_STATUS\\n() function, and assign a 0 to the status column where the extension number matches\\nthe value in the ${WHO} variable (i.e., 1101). We then end the loop with EndWhile() and\\nreturn back to the valid_login extension at the set_login_status priority label (as discussed previously):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogout_login,n,Set(ROW_COUNTER=$[${ROW_COUNTER} + 1])\\nlogout_login,n,EndWhile()\\nlogout_login,n,Goto(valid_login,set_login_status)\\n\\n; logout phone\\n; return to logging in\\n\\nThe rest of the context should be fairly straightforward (if some of this doesn\\'t make\\nsense, we suggest you go back and refresh your memory with Chapter 5 and Chapter 6). The one trick you may be unfamiliar with could be the usage of the ${ODB\\nCROWS} channel variable, which is set by the HOTDESK_STATUS() function. This tells us\\nhow many rows were affected in the SQL UPDATE, which we assume to be 1. If the value\\nof ${ODBCROWS} is less than 1, then we assume an error and handle appropriately:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogout,n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 1]?error,1)\\nlogout,n,Hangup()\\n\\nexten => login_fail,1,NoOp()\\nexten => login_fail,n,Playback(silence/1&login-fail)\\nexten => login_fail,n,Hangup()\\nexten => error,1,NoOp()\\nexten => error,n,Playback(silence/1&connection-failed)\\nexten => error,n,Hangup()\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\ninvalid_user,n,Verbose(1|Hot Desk extension ${E} does not exist)\\ninvalid_user,n,Hangup()\\n\\nWe also include the hotdesk_outbound context which will handle our outgoing calls\\nafter we have logged the agent in to the system:\\ninclude => hotdesk_outbound\\n\\nThe hotdesk_outbound context utilizes many of the same principles and usage as previously discussed, so we won\\'t approach it quite so thoroughly, but essentially the\\n[hotdesk_outbound] context will catch all dialed numbers from the desk phones. We first\\nset our LOCATION variable using the CHANNEL variable, then determine which extension\\n(agent) is logged in to the system and assign it to the WHO variable. If this variable is\\nNULL, then we reject the outgoing call. If not NULL, then we get the agent information\\nusing the HOTDESK_INFO() function and assign it to several CHANNEL variables. This\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 283\\n\\x0cincludes the context to handle the call with, where we perform a Goto() to the context\\nwe have been assigned (which controls our outbound access).\\nIf we try to dial a number that is not handled by our context (or one of the transitive\\ncontexts--i.e., international contains -> long distance, which also contains -> local),\\nthen the built-in extension i is executed which plays back a message stating the action\\ncannot be performed, then hangs up the caller:\\n[hotdesk_outbound]\\nexten => _X.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(LOCATION=${CUT(CHANNEL,/,2)})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(LOCATION=${CUT(LOCATION,-,1)})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(WHO=${HOTDESK_PHONE_STATUS(${LOCATION})})\\nexten => _X.,n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${WHO})}]?no_outgoing,1)\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CID_NAME=${HOTDESK_INFO(cid_name,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CID_NUMBER=${HOTDESK_INFO(cid_number,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CONTEXT=${HOTDESK_INFO(context,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Goto(${${WHO}_CONTEXT},${EXTEN},1)\\n[international]\\nexten => _011.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _011.,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _011.,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\ninclude => longdistance\\n[longdistance]\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Goto(1${EXTEN},1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\ninclude => local\\n[local]\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\n\\nIf the call is allowed to be executed, then the call is sent to the [outgoing] context for\\ncall processing, where the caller ID name and number are set with the CALLERID()\\n\\n284 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cfunction.

See why\\nwe\\'re so excited about this feature as well?!\\n\\nThe func_odbc Backport\\nWith Asterisk 1.4, you can use a backported version of func_odbc that uses a slightly\\ndifferent configuration format. This allows you to use multiple DSN connections to\\nseparate databases, and also to utilize the ${ODBCROWS} channel variable for SQL read\\n(SELECT) queries. To check out the backport of func_odbc and install it (which overwrites the existing func_odbc.c file):\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\ncp: overwrite `./asterisk-1.4/funcs/func_odbc.c\\'? y\\nmake install\\n\\nThe version described in this chapter works with a stock Asterisk 1.4 system, but the\\nbackport (and Asterisk 1.6) will use the following syntax changes:\\n read will become readsql\\n write will become writesql\\n dsn will become readhandle and writehandle (for separate read and write database\\nlocations)\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 285\\n\\x0c Multiple readhandles and writehandles can be listed, in order of preference, to\\nperform failover when the primary handle cannot be contacted (limit of 5)\\n prefix will remain unchanged\\nThe current syntax in Asterisk 1.4 will continue to work in the backport, but will display\\na deprecation warning in the version to follow. Support will eventually be removed.\\n\\nODBC Voicemail\\nAsterisk contains the ability to store voicemail inside the database using the ODBC\\nconnector. This is useful in a clustered environment where you want to abstract the\\nvoicemail data from the local system so that multiple Asterisk boxes have access to the\\nsame data. Of course, you have to take into consideration that you are centralizing a\\npart of Asterisk, and you need to take actions to protect that data, such as regular\\nbackups, and possibly clustering the database backend using replication. If you are\\nusing PostgreSQL, there are some good projects for doing this: PGcluster (http://pgfoun\\ndry.org/projects/pgcluster/) and Slony-I (http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/slony1/proj\\ndisplay.php).\\nAsterisk stores the voicemail inside a Binary Large Object (BLOB). When retrieving the\\ndata, it pulls the information out of the BLOB and temporarily stores it on the hard\\ndrive while it is being played back to the user. Asterisk then removes the BLOB and\\nrecords from the database when the user deletes the voicemail. Many databases, such\\nas MySQL, contain native support for BLOBs, but PostgreSQL has a couple of extra\\nsteps required to utilize this functionality that we\\'ll explore in this section. When you\\'re\\ndone, you\\'ll be able to record, play back, and delete voicemail data from the database\\njust as if it were stored on the local hard drive.\\nThis section builds upon previous configuration sections in this chapter.\\nIf you have not already done so, be sure to follow the steps in the\\n\"Installing the Database\" and \"Installing and Configuring ODBC\" sections before continuing. In the \"Installing and Configuring ODBC\"\\nsection, be sure you have enabled ODBC_STORAGE in the menuselect system\\nunder Voicemail Options.\\n\\nCreating the Large Object Type\\nWe have to tell PostgreSQL how to handle the large objects. This includes creating a\\ntrigger to clean up the data when we delete a record from the database that references\\na large object.\\nConnect to the database as the asterisk user from the console:\\n# psql -h localhost -U asterisk asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\n286 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAt the PostgreSQL console, run the following script to create the large object type:\\nCREATE FUNCTION loin (cstring) RETURNS lo AS \\'oidin\\' LANGUAGE internal IMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION loout (lo) RETURNS cstring AS \\'oidout\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION lorecv (internal) RETURNS lo AS \\'oidrecv\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION losend (lo) RETURNS bytea AS \\'oidrecv\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE TYPE lo ( INPUT = loin, OUTPUT = loout, RECEIVE = lorecv, SEND = losend,\\nINTERNALLENGTH = 4, PASSEDBYVALUE );\\nCREATE CAST (lo AS oid) WITHOUT FUNCTION AS IMPLICIT;\\nCREATE CAST (oid AS lo) WITHOUT FUNCTION AS IMPLICIT;\\n\\nWe\\'ll be making use of the PostgreSQL procedural language called pgSQL/PL to create\\na function. This function will be called from a trigger that gets executed whenever we\\nmodify or delete a record from the table used to store voicemail. This is so the data is\\ncleaned up and not left as an orphan in the database:\\nCREATE FUNCTION vm_lo_cleanup() RETURNS \"trigger\"\\nAS $$\\ndeclare\\nmsgcount INTEGER;\\nbegin\\n-- raise notice \\'Starting lo_cleanup function for large object with oid\\n%\\',old.recording;\\n-- If it is an update action but the BLOB (lo) field was not changed,\\ndont do anything\\nif (TG_OP = \\'UPDATE\\') then\\nif ((old.recording = new.recording) or (old.recording is NULL)) then\\nraise notice \\'Not cleaning up the large object table,\\nas recording has not changed\\';\\nreturn new;\\nend if;\\nend if;\\nif (old.recording IS NOT NULL) then\\nSELECT INTO msgcount COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM voicemessages WHERE recording\\n= old.recording;\\nif (msgcount > 0) then\\nraise notice \\'Not deleting record from the large object table, as object is\\nstill referenced\\';\\nreturn new;\\nelse\\nperform lo_unlink(old.recording);\\nif found then\\nraise notice \\'Cleaning up the large object table\\';\\nreturn new;\\nelse\\nraise exception \\'Failed to cleanup the large object table\\';\\nreturn old;\\nend if;\\nend if;\\nelse\\nraise notice \\'No need to cleanup the large object table, no recording on old row\\';\\n\\nODBC Voicemail | 287\\n\\x0creturn new;\\nend if;\\nend$$\\nLANGUAGE plpgsql;\\n\\nWe\\'re going to create a table called voicemessages where the voicemail information will\\nbe stored:\\nCREATE TABLE voicemessages\\n(\\nuniqueid serial PRIMARY KEY,\\nrecording lo,\\n\"read\" bool DEFAULT false\\n);\\n\\nAnd now we need to associate a trigger with our newly created table in order to perform\\ncleanup whenever we make a change or deletion from the voicemessages table:\\nCREATE TRIGGER vm_cleanup AFTER DELETE OR UPDATE ON voicemessages FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE\\nPROCEDURE vm_lo_cleanup();\\n\\nConfiguring voicemail.conf for ODBC Storage\\nThere isn\\'t much to add to the voicemail.conf file to enable the ODBC voicemail storage.\\nIn fact, it\\'s only three lines! Generally, you probably have multiple format types defined\\nin the [general] section of voicemail.conf, however we need to set this to a single format.\\nThe wav49 format is a compressed WAV file format that should be playable on both\\nLinux and Microsoft Windows desktops.\\nThe odbcstorage option points at the name you defined in the res_odbc.conf file (if\\nyou\\'ve been following along in this chapter, then we called it asterisk). The odbctable\\noption refers to the table where voicemail information should be stored. In the examples\\nin this chapter we use the table named voicemessages:\\n[general]\\nodbcstorage=asterisk\\nodbctable=voicemessages\\n\\nYou may want to create a separate voicemail context, or you can utilize the default\\nvoicemail context:\\n[default]\\n\\n288 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cNow connect to your Asterisk console and unload then reload the app_voicemail.so\\nmodule:\\n*CLI> module unload app_voicemail.so\\n== Unregistered application \\'VoiceMail\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'VoiceMailMain\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'MailboxExists\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'VMAuthenticate\\'\\n*CLI> module load app_voicemail.so\\nLoaded /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/app_voicemail.so => (Comedian Mail (Voicemail System))\\n== Registered application \\'VoiceMail\\'\\n== Registered application \\'VoiceMailMain\\'\\n== Registered application \\'MailboxExists\\'\\n== Registered application \\'VMAuthenticate\\'\\n== Parsing \\'/etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf\\': Found\\n\\nAnd verify that your new mailbox loaded successfully:\\n*CLI> voicemail show users for default\\nContext\\nMbox User\\ndefault\\n1000 J.P.

If you wish to do the latter, you could define\\na new SIP user in sip.conf like so (this will work assuming the phone is on the local LAN):\\n[odbc_test_user]\\ntype=friend\\nsecret=supersecret\\ncontext=odbc_vm_test\\nhost=dynamic\\nqualify=yes\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nallow=gsm\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to reload the SIP module:\\n*CLI> module reload chan_sip.so\\n\\nAnd verify that the SIP user exists:\\n\\nODBC Voicemail | 289\\n\\x0c*CLI> sip show users like odbc_test_user\\nUsername\\nSecret\\nodbc_test_user\\nsupersecret\\n\\nAccountcode\\n\\nDef.Context\\nodbc_vm_test\\n\\nACL\\nNo\\n\\nNAT\\n\\nThen configure your phone or client with the username odbc_test_user and password\\nsupersecret, and then place a call to extension 100 to leave a voicemail.

This is useful for systems where you need to start scaling by clustering multiple Asterisk boxes working with the same centralized information, or when\\nyou want to start building external applications to modify information without requiring a reload of the system (i.e., not requiring the modification of flatfiles).\\n\\nConclusion | 291\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nManaging Your Asterisk System\\n\\nIt won\\'t be covered in the book. The source code has to be useful for something,\\nafter all.\\n--Larry Wall\\n\\nWhile there is a cornucopia of creative things that you are going to want to do with\\nyour spanking-new Asterisk system, there are also some basic, unglamorous, dare we\\nsay, boring things that need to be discussed.\\n\\nCall Detail Recording\\nWithout even being told, Asterisk assumes that you want to store CDR information.*\\nBy default, Asterisk will create a CSV file and place it in the folder /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/. To the naked eye, this file looks like a bit of a mess. If,\\nhowever, you separate each line according to the commas, you will find that each line\\ncontains information about a particular call, and that the commas separate the following values:\\naccountcode\\n\\nAssigned if configured for the channel in the channel configuration file (i.e.,\\nsip.conf). The account code is assigned on a per-channel basis. You can also change\\nthis value from the dialplan by setting CDR(accountcode).\\nsrc\\n\\nReceived Caller ID (string, 80 characters).\\n* If you are wondering why such an obviously simple thing seems to be such an achievement, the reason is\\n\\nsimply that many traditional PBXes do not have this capability built in. With those systems, you have to\\npurchase some sort of third-party appliance even just to capture the raw call data. Asterisk simply stores it.\\nNo drama. No cost. No kidding.\\n A Comma Separated Values (CSV) file is a common method of formatting database-type information in a\\n\\ntext file. You can open CSV files with a text editor, but most spreadsheet and database programs will also\\nread them and properly parse them into rows and columns.\\n\\n\\x0cdst\\n\\nDestination extension.\\ndcontext\\n\\nDestination context.\\nclid\\n\\nCaller ID with text (80 characters).\\nchannel\\n\\nChannel used (80 characters).\\ndstchannel\\n\\nDestination channel, if appropriate (80 characters).\\nlastapp\\n\\nLast application, if appropriate (80 characters).\\nlastdata\\n\\nLast application data (arguments, 80 characters).\\nstart\\n\\nStart of call (date/time).\\nanswer\\n\\nAnswer of call (date/time).\\nend\\n\\nEnd of call (date/time).\\nduration\\n\\nTotal time in system, in seconds (integer), from dial to hangup.\\nbillsec\\n\\nTotal time call is up, in seconds (integer), from answer to hangup.\\ndisposition\\n\\nWhat happened to the call (ANSWERED, NO ANSWER, BUSY).\\namaflags\\n\\nWhat flags to use (DOCUMENTATION, BILL, IGNORE, etc.), specified on a per-channel\\nbasis, like accountcode.

Asterisk currently supports SQLite, PostgreSQL,\\nMySQL, and unixODBC, but we will cover only ODBC in this book (see Chapter 12).\\nMany people prefer to store their CDRs in a database, so that queries can be run to help\\nwith billing and resource management.\\n\\n294 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cManaging Logs\\nAsterisk activity generates events that will cause the creation of an entry in either the\\nmain system logs, or in Asterisk\\'s own logfiles. On a busy system (or a system that is\\nexperiencing a severe problem), these logfiles can grow very large, very quickly. If debugging is turned on, the processes involved in writing to these logfiles can begin to\\nhave an effect on system performance. By default, Asterisk will simply add to the files\\nuntil the hard drive is full. Fortunately, Linux provides utilities to handle the rotation\\nof logfiles (so that no single file becomes too large), and also the deletion of older logfiles\\n(which will prevent the system from getting clogged with logfiles).\\nThe logrotate utility is normally run once per day by the operating system. Unfortunately, since there is no script installed to instruct logrotate on how to handle Asterisk,\\nits logfiles will grow unchecked until a rotate script is added to handle them. In order\\nto make that happen, we need to set up parameters for Asterisk in a file in the /etc/\\nlogrotate.d directory. This file will need to rotate the current logfile, and then send\\nAsterisk instructions to rotate its own logger (causing it to stop using the now old logfile,\\nand generate a new file).\\nCreate a new file /etc/logrotate.d/asterisk and place the following lines in it:\\n/var/log/asterisk/* /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv {\\nmissingok\\nsharedscripts\\nmonthly\\npostrotate\\nasterisk -rx \"logger rotate\" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null\\nendscript\\n}\\n\\nThis file tells the logrotate utility to rotate the Asterisk logs every month, save 12 months\\nworth of logs, and then tell Asterisk that the logfiles have been rotated (which will cause\\nAsterisk to create new logfiles and begin writing to them). We selected these values\\narbitrarily. Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.\\n\\nRunning Asterisk As a Non-root User\\nBy default, Asterisk runs as the root user, and while we don\\'t have any hard data, our\\nown experiences lead us to conclude that the vast majority of Asterisk systems are run\\nin this default state. From a security perspective, this represents an unacceptable\\nriskstrangely, one which most of us seem willing to take.\\nRunning Asterisk as non-root is not terribly hard to achieve, but it requires a few extra\\nsteps, and debugging it can be frustrating if you do not understand how Linux permissions work. However, from a security perspective it is well worth the effort.\\n\\nManaging Logs | 295\\n\\x0cWe\\'re going to run Asterisk as the user asterisk, so we need to create that user on our\\nsystem first. The following commands will be run as root. We\\'ll tell you when to switch\\nand use the asterisk user that we\\'re about to create:\\n# adduser -c \"Asterisk PBX\" asterisk\\n# passwd asterisk\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve created the asterisk user, let\\'s switch to that user, with which we\\'ll\\nperform the rest of the commands. Once we su to the asterisk user, we can download\\na copy of Asterisk via SVN, FTP or WGET, and then compile and install. We\\'re going\\nto grab a copy of Asterisk from the SVN repository in the following example.\\n1.4.5 is the current release version at the time of this writing, but it won\\'t\\nbe by the time you read this, so check the Asterisk web site for the latest\\nversion. In other words, don\\'t just type 1.4.5 whenever you see us refer\\nto it. Find out what is current and use that instead.\\nsu - asterisk\\n./configure --prefix=$HOME/asterisk-bin --sysconfdir=$HOME/asterisk-bin\\n--localstatedir=$HOME/asterisk-bin\\n$ make menuselect\\n$ make install\\n#\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n\\nWhen running the ./configure script with the --prefix flag, we\\'re telling the system to\\ninstall the binary components into our $HOME directory under the subdirectory called\\nasterisk-bin. The --sysconfdir flag tells the system where to place the configuration\\nfiles, and --localstatedir tells the system where to install additional files, such as\\nsounds. The key here is that since we are downloading, compiling, and installing as the\\nuser asterisk, everything that only gets created will be assigned to that user, and have\\nthe permissions granted to that user.\\nWe can now install the sample files as well into the $HOME/asterisk-bin/asterisk\\ndirectory:\\n$ make samples\\n\\nTest starting up Asterisk with the following command:\\n$ ./asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk -cvvv\\n\\nNormally, Asterisk needs to be run as a service. During installation, the make config\\ncommand will install the init scripts. Unfortunately, this will not work when you are\\nlogged in as the user asterisk, because only the root user has the authority to make\\n\\n su historically means super-user, but nowadays it could also mean switch-user or substitute-user. The - in\\n\\nthe command tells su to use the environment for that user (for example to use the PATH for that user)\\n $HOME is a system variable that defines the path to the home directory for the current user, i.e., /home/asterisk.\\n\\n296 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cchanges to system startup commands. It would appear that what we need to do is log\\nin as root, navigate to the /home/asterisk/asterisk-1.4.5 folder, and run the\\nmake config command again (now with the authority to really make it happen). Problem\\nsolved, right?\\nYes, but not quite. If you run the service asterisk start command, you will find that\\nit complains that it cannot find asterisk. Know why? Because the init script figures the\\nasterisk executable got installed in /usr/sbin, where it would be if we had installed\\nasterisk as root. So, we need to tell the init script where to find asterisk and the\\nsafe_asterisk script, like this:\\n# ln -s /home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk /usr/sbin/asterisk\\n# ln -s /home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/safe_asterisk /usr/sbin/safe_asterisk\\n\\nSince the init script utilizes the safe_asterisk script, and by default wants to start Asterisk\\nas the root user, we have to modify the safe_asterisk script telling it to run Asterisk as\\nour non-root user. So open up the safe_asterisk script with your favorite text editor and\\nlook for the ASTARGS variable (around line 78). Then add -U asterisk between the quotes\\nlike so:\\n#\\n# Don\\'t fork when running \"safely\"\\n#\\nASTARGS=\"-U asterisk\"\\n\\nGo ahead and start Asterisk by running service asterisk start and verify Asterisk is\\nrunning as the asterisk user using the ps command:\\n# service asterisk start\\n# ps aux | grep asterisk\\nSl\\n/home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk -U asterisk -vvvg -c\\n\\nThe 503 is actually our asterisk user, which we verify by looking at the /etc/passwd file:\\n# cat /etc/passwd\\n\\nReboot the system to ensure that everything comes up as required. Keep in mind that\\na lot of things that you do with Asterisk might assume that you are running as root, so\\nkeep an eye out for errors that relate to a lack of permission. Your Asterisk process may\\nthink it is the superuser, but we have clipped its wings somewhat.\\nWhy go through the trouble? The advantage of this is simply that if any security vulnerability in Asterisk allows someone to access the box through the Asterisk account,\\n\\n If you walk up to any system that\\'s running Asterisk, hook a keyboard and screen up to it, and press Alt-F9;\\n\\nyou will be connected to the Asterisk CLI. Press ! and hit Return, and you will have a shell. If Asterisk is\\nrunning as root, you now own that system.\\n\\nRunning Asterisk As a Non-root User | 297\\n\\x0che will be limited to system activities allowed by that account. When Asterisk is run as\\nroot, a security compromise gives the intruder full control of your system.\\n\\nCustomizing System Prompts\\nIn keeping with the seemingly limitless flexibility of Asterisk, you can also modify the\\nsystem prompts. This is very simple to explain, but generally difficult to do well.\\nWith more than 300 system prompts in the main distribution, and an additional 600\\nin the asterisk-sounds add-on, if you\\'re contemplating customizing all of them you\\'d\\nbetter have either a lot of money or a lot of time on your hands.\\nAn audio engineer is also recommended to ensure that the recordings are normalized\\nto 3 dB and that all prompts start and end at a zero-crossing point (with just the right\\namount of silence prepended and appended).\\n\\nThe Voice\\nIf you are interested in The Voice of Asterisk, she is Allison Smith, and she can deliver\\ncustomized recordings for you to use on your own system.\\nThis is a powerful concept, as very few PBXes allow you to use the same voice in your\\ncustom recordings as is used by the system prompts.\\nAllison is the voice of the system prompts in both English and Spanish.\\nThere are also prompts available in French. Montreal\\'s own June Wallack is the voice\\nof the French Asterisk prompts (and also does prompts in flawless English,# should\\nyou want the same voice for both languages).\\nTo find out how to get your own voice prompts, visit the Digium web site, http://\\nwww.digium.com/products/voice.\\n\\nOnce you have the recordings, the actual implementation is easy--simply replace the\\nfiles in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds with the ones you have created.\\nAlternatively, you can opt to record your own prompts and place them in a folder of\\nyour choosing. When you refer to sound files with the Playback() or Background()\\napplications, you can refer to the full pathname of the sound file, or to any subdirectory\\nof /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/.\\nNote that the default sounds that come with Asterisk are delivered in format. We would\\nnot normally recommend storing them in this format (unless you have a lot of channels\\n# We were going to say \"accentless English\", but then we\\'d have to apologize to folks from the British Isles,\\n\\nAustralia, South Africa, and who knows where else. We are not experts in languages, dialects, and such, but our\\nears tell us that there is a type of accent that in North America is common for professional voices. This is the\\naccent that is common to the Pacific coast from San Diego to Seattle, and most of English-speaking Canada as\\nwell. Both June and Allison deliver English prompts in this accent, and we think it sounds great.\\n\\n298 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cthat will be entering the system using the GSM codec). Sure, you save some hard drive\\nspace, but the extra load on your CPU when it has to transcode all these files (not to\\nmention the lower overall quality of the sound) makes the use of GSM undesirable, to\\nour thinking. Use uncompressed files (such as .wav, .ulaw or .alaw) and your CPU will\\nnot have to work as hard. As an added bonus, your prompts will sound better.\\n\\nSound Recording from the Dialplan\\nSurprisingly, one of the easiest ways to get respectable-quality recordings is not through\\na PC with fancy editing software, but rather through a telephone set. There are many\\nreasons for this, but the most important is that the telephone will tend to filter out\\nbackground noise (such as white noise caused by HVAC equipment) and will record\\nat a consistent audio level.\\nThis little addition to your dialplan will allow you to easily create recordings, which\\nwill be placed in your system\\'s /tmp/ folder (from there, you can rename them and move\\nthem wherever you\\'d like):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nThis snippet will allow you to dial from 6600 to 6699, and it will record prompts in\\nthe /tmp/ folder using the names prompt00.wav to prompt99.wav. After you complete\\nrecording (by pressing the # key), it will play your prompt back to you and hang up.\\nBe sure to move your prompts out of the /tmp/ dir to the Asterisk sounds directory. To\\nkeep the dialplan readable, rename your prompt<XX> files to something more meaningful. For example:\\nmv /tmp/prompt00.wav /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/welcome-message.wav\\n\\nMusic on Hold\\nAny popular PBX system offers the ability to supply a source of music to be played for\\ncallers while on hold. Asterisk allows for a lot of creativity in this regard.\\nNowadays, everyone is familiar with the MP3 music format, and there is a lot of interest\\nin using MP3s as a music-on-hold source. The concept sure seems like a good idea, but\\nthere are a few things that we think should be given some consideration:\\n\\nMusic on Hold | 299\\n\\x0c MP3 files are extremely complex, and require a substantial amount of CPU to\\ndecode. If you have a lot of channels pulling music from the system (for example,\\npeople sometimes like to listen to music through their phone, or a call center may\\nhave several callers on hold), the load on the CPU caused by all of the transcoding\\nof the stored MP3 files could place too much demand on a machine that is otherwise\\nsuitable to the performance needs of the system.\\n Current-generation hard drives hold a lot of data, so there may not be any reason\\nto worry about cutting down hard drive use. Compressed audio makes sense from\\na distribution standpoint (an MP3 is a much smaller download than the equivalent\\nin .wav format), but once on your system, do we really care how much space they\\ntake up?\\n MP3 files don\\'t usually come with the right sort of licensing. ;-)\\nTaking all of this into consideration, we recommend that you convert your music sources into the native format of the various codecs you may be supporting. For example,\\nif you support law for your internal phones, and G.729 on your VoIP circuits, you will\\nwant to store your music in both formats so that Asterisk will not have to perform\\ntranscoding to play music to calls on those channels.\\n\\nFree Music\\nA lot of people do not realize that playing music on hold requires a special license. This\\nis true even if you play music from CDs that you own, or from the radio. To ensure that\\nthere is no ambiguity, we recommend avoiding the whole matter and using only music\\nthat does not come encumbered with the kind of licenses that the music industry seems\\nto prefer.\\nThere are many web sites where you can go to get music that is licensed in a manner\\nthat is suitable for music on hold. Two that we have found are http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Wikipedia:Sound/list and http://www.opsound.org/.\\nBoth offer a sizeable collection of music that can be easily downloaded. Note that this\\nmay not all be of professional quality, so listen to all of it before you commit it to your\\nmusic-on-hold collection.*\\n\\nWe often use public domain music (or Creative Commons licensed music) on our\\nsystems. Creative Commons music often comes in ogg-Vorbis format (which is conceptually similar to MP3, but not compatible). In order to play .ogg or .mp3 files on our\\nAsterisk system, we are going to convert them to a format that Asterisk can easily\\nhandle. This requires the following steps:\\n1. We need to make sure that SoX, the Sound eXchange utility, is installed. If not,\\nrun the following command to install it:\\n* Seed a search with the term \"Creative Commons music\" to find more freely usable music.\\n\\n300 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0c$ yum install sox\\n\\n2. Download the music that you have chosen to a working folder on your system\\n(/tmp is probably a suitable location). As an example, the following command\\ndownloaded some nice piano music by Pachelbel for us:\\n$ wget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Pachelbel%27s_Canon.ogg\\n\\n3. Now we have to convert the song from ogg-Vorbis format to a format more suitable\\nto Asterisk:\\n$ sox Pachelbel\\\\\\'s_Canon.ogg -r 8000 -c 1 -s -w moh1.wav resample -ql\\n\\nYou may also need to adjust the amplitude with the -v option.\\n\\nWe\\'ve now taken our source file, converted it to a .wav file suitable to Asterisk,\\nand saved the resulting file as moh1.wav.\\n4. Almost done now. We just need to create a folder for the permanent home of the\\nnew files (/tmp is certainly no place for them):\\n$ mkdir /var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\n\\nand then move them there:\\n$ mv *.wav /var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\n\\n5. Since we have placed our music files in a different folder from that where Asterisk\\ninstalls its sample music, we will need to change the configuration file to reflect\\nthis. Edit your /etc/asterisk/musiconhold.conf file with one that contains the\\nfollowing:\\n[default]\\nmode=files\\ndirectory=/var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\nrandom=yes\\n\\nAs for what to play, that will depend on what image you want to project to your callers.\\nRegardless of your choice, you should keep some things in mind:\\n People don\\'t actually want to be on hold, so they are not usually planning to be\\nthere for long. This means that there is not much point in providing them with a\\nmind-expanding musical experience. If things go as they hope, they won\\'t be there\\nlong enough to get into it.\\n\\n Note that we could have used any format that was compatible with Asterisk; we\\'ve just chosen .wav for this\\n\\nexample because it is easy for the CPU to transcode into law/alaw/slin on the fly, yet remains easy to work\\nwith in other environments.\\n\\nMusic on Hold | 301\\n\\x0c The fidelity on a phone system does not allow for accurate reproduction of tones.\\nHeavy bass generally sounds terrible, and high frequencies will typically just end\\nup as noise. Keep the music simple, and it is more likely to sound good.\\n Musical tastes are as varied as people, and while it might be nice to try and cover\\na wide range of styles, music that is too eclectic is more likely to annoy than enlighten.\\nClassical music addresses all of the above criteria, and it is easy to obtain. It also sounds\\nclassy (go figure!), so it is a pretty safe choice, although we\\'ll admit it doesn\\'t usually\\nscore any points in the hipness department.\\nAsterisk includes three songs with the source code download that are licensed for use\\nwith Asterisk. These songs are intended as samples. Since there are only three of them,\\npeople who call you regularly will quickly tire of them. We have a recurring nightmare\\nin which the worldwide success of Asterisk means that the human race is forced to\\nlisten to the same three songs as music on hold. That is why we wrote this section for\\nyou.\\n\\nRandomizing Music on Hold\\nIn a traditional PBX, music on hold usually comes from a single source. Everyone that\\nis hearing music is hearing the exact same thing at the exact same time, and even when\\nno one is on hold, the music is still playing. On Asterisk, the music is not playing until\\na need for it arises, and each caller gets her own music source. If Asterisk were to simply\\nstart playing songs in the order it found them, each call placed on hold would always\\nhear the same song starting from the beginning. In order to simulate traditional music\\non hold, Asterisk can (and normally should) be set to play the music in a random\\nfashion. This means that it will select which file to play at random. If you have enough\\ndifferent songs in your music-on-hold directory, you will minimize the chance that\\nsomeone who calls frequently will have to listen to the same songs all of the time.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis chapter could easily become a book (and possibly will one day). We have chosen\\na few topics to cover that we think will provide value to most readers, but there are\\ncertainly many more topics that can be discussed. As with so many things in this book,\\nwe have merely scratched the surface.\\n\\n302 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0c\\nPotpourri\\n\\nThe first 90 percent of the task takes 90 percent of the\\ntime, and the last 10 percent of the task takes the other\\n90 percent of the time.\\n--The Ninety:Ten Rule\\n\\nThe toughest part of writing this book was not finding things to write about, but rather\\ndeciding what we would not be able to write about. Now that we\\'ve covered the basics,\\nyou are ready to be told the truth: we have not taught you anywhere near all that there\\nis to know about Asterisk.\\nNow please understand, this is not because we didn\\'t want to give you our very best;\\nit\\'s merely because Asterisk is, well, limitless (or so we believe).\\nIn this chapter, we want to give you a taste of some of the wonders Asterisk holds in\\nstore for you. Nearly every section in this chapter could become a book in itself (and\\nthey will become books, if Asterisk succeeds in the way we think it is going to).\\n\\nFestival\\nFestival is a popular open source text-to-speech engine. The basic premise of using\\nFestival with Asterisk is that your dialplan can pass a body of text to Festival, which\\nwill then \"speak\" the text to the caller. Probably the most obvious use for Festival would\\nbe to have it read your email to you when you are on the road.*\\n\\n* Probably the coolest use of Festival is in Simon Ditner\\'s ZoIP, a port of the famous Zork game to a fully\\n\\nspeech-enabled engine running on Asterisk (ZoIP also uses Sphinx, which we will not be covering in this\\nbook). We\\'re going to have to come up with a new kind of name for this sort of thing. It\\'s not a video game,\\nsince there is no screen, so do we need to call these audio games? Regardless, check it out at http://\\nwww.zoip.org.\\n\\n\\x0cGetting Festival Set Up and Ready for Asterisk\\nThere are currently two ways to use Festival with Asterisk. The first (and easiest) method--without having to patch and recompile Festival--is to add the following text to\\nFestival\\'s configuration file (festival.scm, usually located in /etc/ or /usr/share/festival/):\\n(define (tts_textasterisk string mode)\\n\"(tts_textasterisk STRING MODE)\\nApply tts to STRING. This function is specifically designed for use in\\nserver mode so a single function call may synthesize the string. This\\nfunction name may be added to the server safe functions.\"\\n(let ((wholeutt (utt.synth (eval (list \\'Utterance \\'Text string)))))\\n(utt.wave.resample wholeutt 8000)\\n(utt.wave.rescale wholeutt 5)\\n(utt.send.wave.client wholeutt)))\\n\\nYou may place this text anywhere in the file, as long as it is not between any other\\nparentheses.\\nThe second (and more traditional) way is to compile Festival with an Asterisk-specific\\npatch (located in the contrib/ directory of the Asterisk source).\\nInformation on both of these methods is contained in the README.festival file, located\\nin the contrib/ directory of the Asterisk source.\\nFor either method, you\\'ll need to modify the Festival access list in the festival.scm file.\\nSimply search for the word \"localhost\" and replace it with the fully qualified domain\\nname of your server.\\nBoth of these methods set up Festival to be able to correctly communicate with Asterisk.\\nAfter setting up Festival, you should start the Festival server. You can then call the\\nFestival() application from within your dialplan.\\n\\nConfiguring Asterisk for Festival\\nThe Asterisk configuration file that deals with Festival is aptly called festival.conf. Inside\\nthis file, you specify the hostname and port of your Festival server, as well some settings\\nfor the caching of Festival speech. For most installations (if you\\'re going to run Festival\\non your Asterisk server), the defaults will work just fine.\\n\\nStarting the Festival Server\\nTo start the Festival server for debugging purposes, simply run festival with the\\n--server argument, like this:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival --server\\n\\n304 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cOnce you\\'re sure that the Festival server is running and not rejecting your connections,\\nyou can start Festival by typing:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival_server 2>&1 >/dev/null &\\n\\nCalling Festival from the Dialplan\\nNow that Festival is configured and the Festival server is started, let\\'s call it from within\\na simple dialplan:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,Festival(Asterisk and Festival are working together)\\n\\nYou should always call the Answer() application before calling\\nFestival(), to ensure that a channel is established.\\n\\nAs Asterisk connects to Festival, you should see output like this in the terminal where\\nyou started the Festival server:\\n[root@asterisk ~]#\\nserver\\nSun May\\nclient(1) Sun May\\nclient(1) Sun May\\n\\nfestival --server\\n1 18:38:51 2005 : Festival server started on port 1314\\n\\nIf you see output like the following, it means you didn\\'t add the host to the access list\\nin festival.scm:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival --server\\nserver\\nSun May 1 18:30:52 2005 : Festival server started on port 1314\\nclient(1) Sun May 1 18:32:32 2005 : rejected from asterisk.localdomain not\\nin access list\\n\\nYet Another Way to Use Festival with Asterisk\\nSome people in the Asterisk community have reported success with passing text to\\nFestival\\'s text2wave utility and then having Asterisk play back the resulting .wav file.\\nFor example, you might do something like this:\\nexten => 124,1,Answer()\\nexten => 124,2,System(echo \"This is a test of Festival\" | /usr/bin/text2wave\\n-scale 1.5 -F 8000 -o /tmp/festival.wav)\\nexten => 124,3,Playback(/tmp/festival)\\nexten => 124,4,System(rm /tmp/festival.wav)\\nexten => 124,5,Hangup()\\n\\nThis method also allows you to call other text-to-speech engines, such as the popular\\nspeech engine from Cepstral http://www.cepstral.com, which is an inexpensive commercial derivative of Festival with very good-sounding voices. For this example, we\\'ll\\nassume that Cepstral is installed in /usr/local/cepstral/:\\nexten => 125,1,Answer()\\nexten => 125,2,System(/usr/local/cepstral/bin/swift -o /tmp/swift.wav\\n\\nFestival | 305\\n\\x0c\"This\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\nis\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\na test of Cepstral\")\\n\\nCall Files\\nCall files allow you to create calls through the Linux shell. These powerful events are\\ntriggered by depositing a .call file in the directory /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing/. The\\nactual name of the file does not matter, but it\\'s good form to give the file a meaningful\\nname and to end the filename with .call.\\nWhen a call file appears in the outgoing folder, Asterisk will almost immediatelyact on\\nthe instructions contained therein.\\nCall files are formatted in the following manner. First, we define where we want to call:\\nChannel: channel\\n\\nWe can control how long to wait for a call to be answered (the default is 45 seconds),\\nhow long to wait between call retries, and the maximum number of retries. If\\nMaxRetries is omitted, the call will be attempted only once:\\nWaitTime: number\\nRetryTime: number\\nMaxRetries: number\\n\\nIf the call is answered, we specify where to connect it here:\\nContext: context-name\\nExtension: ext\\nPriority: priority\\n\\nAlternatively, we can specify a single application and pass arguments to it:\\nApplication: Playback()\\nData: hello-world\\n\\nNext, we set the Caller ID of the outgoing call:\\nCallerID: Asterisk 800-555-1212\\n\\nThen we set channel variables, as follows:\\n\\nand add a CDR account code:\\nAccount: documentation\\n\\n We\\'re talking within milliseconds here. Don\\'t believe us? Try it for yourself!\\n\\n306 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cWhen you create a call file, do not do so from the spool directory. Asterisk monitors the spool aggressively and will try to grab your file before\\nyou\\'ve even finished writing it! Create call files in some other folder,\\nmake a copy in the same folder, and then mv the copy into the spool\\ndirectory. Note that we said mv, not cp. This is important, because the\\nway that Linux copies files means that the file appears in the destination\\nfolder before it is completely there. Contrast that with a mv operation,\\nwhich will not allow the file to appear in the destination folder until the\\nmove operation is complete. If you copy, there is a very good chance\\nthat Asterisk will read the file before it is all there, which will cause\\nunexpected results.\\n\\nDUNDi\\nIf there were any concerns that Mark Spencer was in danger of running out of good\\nideas, Distributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) ought to lay such thoughts\\nto rest. DUNDi is poised to be as revolutionary as Asterisk. The DUNDi web site (http://\\nwww.dundi.com) says it best: \"DUNDiTM is a peer to peer system for locating Internet\\ngateways to telephony services. Unlike traditional centralized services (such as the remarkably simple and concise ENUM standard; http://www.faqs.org/rfc/rfc2916.txt),\\nDUNDi is fully distributed with no centralized authority whatsoever.\" DUNDi is\\nsomewhat of a routing protocol for VoIP.\\n\\nHow Does DUNDi Work?\\nThink of DUNDi as a large phone book that allows you to ask peers if they know of an\\nalternative VoIP route to an extension number or PSTN telephone number.\\nFor example, assume that you are connected to the DUNDi-test network (a free and\\nopen network that terminates calls to traditional PSTN numbers). You ask your friend\\nBob if he knows how to reach 1-212-555-1212, a number for which you have no direct\\naccess. Bob replies, \"I don\\'t know how to reach that number, but let me ask my peer\\nSally.\"\\nBob asks Sally if she knows how to reach the requested number, and she responds with,\\n\"You can reach that number at IAX2/dundi:very_long_password@hostname/extension.\"\\nBob then stores the address in his database and passes on to you the information about\\nhow to reach 1-800-555-1212 via VoIP, allowing you an alternative method of reaching\\nthe same destination through a different network.\\nBecause Bob has stored the information he found, he\\'ll be able to provide it to any peers\\nwho later request the same number from him, so the lookup won\\'t have to go any\\nfurther. This helps reduce the load on the network and increases response times for\\nnumbers that are looked up often. (However, it should be noted that DUNDi creates\\na rotating key and, thus, stored information is valid for a limited period of time.)\\n\\nDUNDi | 307\\n\\x0cDUNDi performs lookups dynamically, either with a switch => statement in your\\nextensions.conf file or with the use of the DUNDiLookup() application. DUNDi is available\\nonly in Asterisk version 1.2 or higher.\\nYou can use the DUNDi protocol in a private network as well. Say you\\'re the Asterisk\\nadministrator of a very large enterprise installation, and you wish to simplify the administration of extension numbers. You could use DUNDi in this situation, allowing\\nmultiple Asterisk boxes (presumably located at each of the company\\'s locations and\\npeered with one another) to perform dynamic lookups for the VoIP addresses of extensions on the network.\\n\\nConfiguring Asterisk for Use with DUNDi\\nThere are three files that need to be configured for DUNDi: dundi.conf,\\nextensions.conf, and iax.conf. The dundi.conf file controls the authentication of peers\\nwhom we allow to perform lookups through our system. This file also manages the list\\nof peers to whom we might submit our own lookup requests. Since it is possible to run\\nseveral different networks on the same box, it is necessary to define a different section\\nfor each peer, and then configure the networks in which that peer is allowed to perform\\nlookups. Additionally, we need to define which peers we wish to use to perform\\nlookups.\\n\\nThe General Peering Agreement\\nThe General Peering Agreement (GPA) is a legally binding license agreement that is\\ndesigned to prevent abuse of the DUNDi protocol. Before connecting to the\\nDUNDi-test group, you are required to sign a GPA. The GPA is used to protect the\\nmembers of the group and to create a \"trust\" between the members. It is a requirement\\nof the DUNDi-test group that your complete and accurate contact information be configured in dundi.conf, so that members of your peer group can contact you. The GPA\\ncan be found in the doc/ subdirectory of the Asterisk source.\\n\\nGeneral configuration\\nThe [general] section of dundi.conf contains parameters relating to the overall operation of the DUNDi client and server:\\n; DUNDi configuration file\\n;\\n[general]\\n;\\ndepartment=IT\\norganization= toronto.example.com\\n\\n The dundi.conf and extensions.conf files must be configured. We have chosen to configure iax.conf for our\\n\\naddress advertisement on the network, but DUNDi is protocol-agnostic--thus sip.conf, h323.conf, or\\nmgcp.conf could be used instead.\\n\\n308 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0clocality=Toronto\\nstateprov=ON\\ncountry=CA\\nemail=support@toronto.example.com\\n;\\n; Specify bind address and port number.\\nentityid=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\\nautokill=yes\\n;secretpath=dundi\\n\\nDefault is 4520\\n\\nThe entity identifier defined by entityid should generally be the Media Access Control\\n(MAC) address of an interface in the machine. The entity ID defaults to the first Ethernet\\naddress of the server, but you can override this with entityid, as long as it is set to the\\nMAC address of something you own. The MAC address of the primary external interface\\nis recommended. This is the address that other peers will use to identify you.\\nThe Time To Live (ttl) field defines how many peers away we wish to receive replies\\nfrom and is used to break loops. Each time a request is passed on down the line because\\nthe requested number is not known, the value in the TTL field is decreased by one,\\nmuch like the TTL field of an ICMP packet. The TTL field also defines the maximum\\nnumber of seconds we are willing to wait for a reply.\\nWhen you request a number lookup, an initial query (called a DPDISCOVER) is sent to\\nyour peers requesting that number. If you do not receive an acknowledgment (ACK) of\\nyour query (DPDISCOVER) within 2,000 ms (enough time for a single transmission only)\\nand autokill is equal to yes, Asterisk will send a CANCEL to the peers. (Note that an\\nacknowledgment is not necessarily a reply to the query; it is just an acknowledgment\\nthat the peer has received the request.) The purpose of autokill is to keep the lookup\\nfrom stalling due to hosts with high latency. In addition to the yes and no options, you\\nmay also specify the number of milliseconds to wait.\\nThe pbx_dundi module creates a rotating key and stores it in the local Asterisk database\\n(AstDB). The key name secret is stored in the dundi family. The value of the key can\\nbe viewed with the database show command at the Asterisk console. The database\\nfamily can be overridden with the secretpath option.\\n\\nCreating mapping contexts\\nThe dundi.conf file defines DUNDi contexts that are mapped to dialplan contexts in\\nyour extensions.conf file. DUNDi contexts are a way of defining distinct and separate\\ndirectory service groups. The contexts in the mapping section point to contexts in the\\nextensions.conf file, which control the numbers that you advertise. When you create a\\npeer, you need to define which mapping contexts you will allow this peer to search.\\nYou do this with the permit statement (each peer may contain multiple permit\\n\\nDUNDi | 309\\n\\x0cstatements). Mapping contexts are related to dialplan contexts in the sense that they\\nare a security boundary for your peers.\\nPhone numbers must be advertised in the following format:\\n<country_code><area_code><prefix><number>\\n\\nFor example, a complete North American number could be advertised as 14165551212.\\nAll DUNDi mapping contexts take the form of:\\ndundi_context => local_context,weight,technology,destination[,options]]\\n\\nThe following configuration creates a DUNDi mapping context that we will use to\\nadvertise our local phone numbers to the DUNDi-test group. Note that this should all\\nappear on one line:\\ndundi-test => dundi-local,0,IAX2,dundi:${SECRET}@toronto.example.com/\\n${NUMBER}, nounsolicited,nocomunsolicit,nopartial\\n\\nIn this example, the mapping context is dundi-test, which points to the dundi-local\\ncontext within extensions.conf (providing a listing of phone numbers to reply to).\\nNumbers that resolve to the PBX should be advertised with a weight of zero (directly\\nconnected). Numbers higher than 0 indicate an increased number of hops or paths to\\nreach the final destination. This is useful when multiple replies for the same lookup are\\nreceived at the end that initially requested the number; a weight with a lower number\\nwill be the preferred path.\\nIf we can reply to a lookup, our response will contain the method by which the other\\nend can connect to the system. This includes the technology to use (such as IAX2, SIP,\\nH323, and so on), the username and password with which to authenticate, which host\\nto send the authentication to, and finally the extension number.\\nAsterisk provides some shortcuts to allow us to create a \"template\" with which we can\\nbuild our responses. The following channel variables can be used to construct the template:\\n${SECRET}\\n\\nReplaced with the password stored in the local AstDB\\n${NUMBER}\\n\\nThe number being requested\\n${IPADDR}\\n\\nThe IP address to connect to\\nIt is generally safest to statically configure the hostname, rather than\\nmaking use of the ${IPADDR} variable. The ${IPADDR} variable will sometimes reply with an address in the private IP space, which is unreachable\\nfrom the Internet.\\n\\n310 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cDefining DUNDi peers\\nDUNDi peers are defined in the dundi.conf file. Peers are identified by the unique layertwo MAC address of an interface on the remote system. The dundi.conf file is where\\nwe define what context to search for peers requesting a lookup and which peers we\\nwant to use when doing a lookup for a particular network:\\n[00:00:00:00:00:00] ; Remote Office\\nmodel = symmetric\\nhost = montreal.example.com\\ninkey = montreal\\noutkey = toronto\\ninclude = dundi-test\\npermit = dundi-test\\nqualify = yes\\ndynamic=yes\\n\\nThe remote peer\\'s identifier (MAC address) is enclosed in square brackets ([]). The\\ninkey and outkey are the public/private key pairs that we use for authentication. Key\\npairs are generated with the astgenkey script, located in the ./asterisk/contrib/scripts/\\nsource directory. Be sure to use the -n flag so that you don\\'t have to initialize passwords\\nevery time you start Asterisk:\\n# cd /var/lib/asterisk/keys\\n# /usr/src/asterisk/contrib/scripts/astgenkey -n toronto\\n\\nThe resulting keys, toronto.pub and toronto.key, will be placed in your /var/lib/asterisk/\\nkeys/ directory. The toronto.pub file is the public key, which you should post to a web\\nserver so that it is easily accessible for anyone with whom you wish to peer. When you\\npeer, you can give your peers the HTTP-accessible public key, which they can then\\nplace in their /var/lib/asterisk/keys/ directories.\\nAfter you have downloaded the keys, you must reload the res_crypto.so and pbx_dun\\ndi.so modules in Asterisk:\\n*CLI> module reload res_crypto.so\\n-- Reloading module \\'res_crypto.so\\' (Cryptographic Digital Signatures)\\n-- Loaded PRIVATE key \\'toronto\\'\\n-- Loaded PUBLIC key \\'toronto\\'\\n*CLI> module reload pbx_dundi.so\\n-- Reloading module \\'pbx_dundi.so\\' (Distributed Universal Number\\nDiscovery\\n(DUNDi))\\n== Parsing \\'/etc/asterisk/dundi.conf\\': Found\\n\\nThen, create the dundi user in the iax.conf file to allow connections into your Asterisk\\nsystem. When a call is authenticated, the extension number being requested is passed\\nto the dundi-local context in the extensions.conf file, where the call is then handled by\\nAsterisk.\\n\\nDUNDi | 311\\n\\x0cAllowing remote connections\\nHere is the user definition for the dundi user:\\n[dundi]\\ntype=user\\ndbsecret=dundi/secret\\ncontext=dundi-local\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nInstead of using a static password, Asterisk regenerates passwords every 3,600 seconds\\n(1 hour). The value is stored in /dundi/secret of the Asterisk database and advertised\\nusing the ${SECRET} variable defined within the mapping context lines in dundi.conf.\\nYou can see the current keys for all peers, including your local public and private keys,\\nby performing a show keys at the Asterisk CLI.\\nThe context entry dundi-local is where authorized callers are sent in extensions.conf.\\nFrom there, we can manipulate the call just as we would in the dialplan of any other\\nincoming connection.\\n\\nConfiguring the dialplan\\nThe extensions.conf file handles what numbers you advertise and what you do with the\\ncalls that connect to them. The dundi-local context performs double duty:\\n It controls the numbers we advertise, referenced by the dundi mapping context in\\ndundi.conf.\\n It controls what to do with the call, referenced by the dundi user in iax.conf.\\nYou have the power of dialplan pattern matching to advertise ranges of numbers and\\nto control the incoming calls. In the following dialplan, we are only advertising the\\nnumber +1-416-555-1212, but pattern matching could just as easily have been employed to advertise a range of numbers or extensions:\\n[dundi-local]\\nexten => 14165551212,1,NoOp(dundi-local: Number advertisement and incoming)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Answer()\\nexten => 14165551212,n(call),Dial(SIP/1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Voicemail(u1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 14165551212,n(call)+101,Voicemail(b1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\n\\nAlternative Voicemail Storage Methods\\nAsterisk\\'s normal way of storing voicemail is to simply record the message in a file,\\nwhich is placed on the local hard drive under the /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail tree.\\nWhile this works well enough for simple PBX deployments, there are more advanced\\n\\n312 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cways of doing this that can be very useful in larger, distributed networks, or environments where tighter integration with external applications is desired.\\n\\nStoring Voicemail in an IMAP Server\\nThe ability to store voice messages in the same location as regular email is something\\nthat the telecom industry has been promising for a long time. They called it Unified\\nMessaging, and while most PBXes now offer some sort of unified messaging, it is typically very expensive to license and implement.\\nNaturally, Asterisk cuts through all the silliness and just allows you to have your voicemailbox integrated into an IMAP environment. There are several advantages to\\nstoring your voicemail on an IMAP server. When you listen to a voicemail on your\\nphone, the message is set to the read state on the IMAP server. This means that your\\nemail client will also note that it has been read. By the same token, if you listen to the\\nmessage from your email client, the voicemail will turn off the message notification\\nlight on any phones that are assigned to that mailbox. Deleting a message from one\\nplace will cause it to be deleted from every place. So once deleted, the message is truly\\ngone. This is Unified Messaging, the holy grail of voicemail to email integration, but\\nAsterisk humbly decides not to make a big deal of it.\\nIMAP integration is still new functionality, so there are a few things that need to be\\nadded in order to get it to function. First off, Asterisk needs to have an IMAP client\\ninstalled so that it can communicate with the IMAP server. Pretty much any IMAP\\nserver works (even Exchange Server), and the authors have personally tested IMAP\\nvoicemail support with both the Courier-IMAP and Dovecot IMAP servers. The IMAP\\nserver may be on the same physical machine as the Asterisk installation, or it may be\\non the other side of the globe. To be able to access the IMAP server, Asterisk requires\\nan IMAP client library. This library is the University of Washington\\'s free IMAP client,\\nnamed c-client. To install the c-client you simply need to navigate to your /usr/src directory and run the following commands:\\n# wget ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z\\n\\nThis downloads the source code. Extract it with:\\n# tar zxvf imap.tar.Z\\n\\nYou\\'ll want to pay special attention to the name of the directory that is\\ncreated by this command, as the directory name will probably change\\nagain by the time you read this. During the production of this book, the\\ndirectory name has changed four times. The last time we checked, it was\\nnamed /usr/src/imap-2006h.\\n\\nNavigate into the resulting folder and run:\\n# make lrh IP6=4\\n\\nAlternative Voicemail Storage Methods | 313\\n\\x0cThis will compile everything Asterisk needs to make use of the IMAP client libraries.\\nNow we have to recompile Asterisk with the IMAP capabilities. We\\'ll need to navigate\\nto the location of our Asterisk source files (such as /usr/src/asterisk), and run the following command:\\n# /configure --with-imap=/usr/src/imap-2006h\\n\\nThe we need to rerun make menuconfig to incorporate IMAP storage into the compile.\\nUnder Voicemail Build Options select the IMAP_STORAGE parameter, and then press x to\\nsave and exit. This ensures that when we compile Asterisk, it will build the IMAP\\nmodule as well. Obviously, the next step then is to recompile and reinstall Asterisk. A\\nsimple way to do this is, in your terminal, to run:\\n# make && make install\\n\\nOK, so we\\'ve got the module compiled and installed. Now it\\'s time to configure it.\\nIn the /etc/asterisk folder, we\\'ll need to add a few lines to the voicemail.conf file, in the\\n[general] section:\\nimapserver=localhost\\nexpungeonhangup=yes\\nauthuser=vmail\\nauthpassword=vmailsecret\\nimapfolder=Voicemail\\n\\nSince Dovecot is available in the CentOS package repository, installing a small IMAP\\nserver to handle your virtual (voicemail) users on your Asterisk box is simple:\\n# yum install dovecot\\n\\nNow make sure that IMAP support is enabled in /etc/dovecot.conf by uncommenting\\nthe protocols line so that it appears as follows:\\nprotocols = imap imaps\\n\\nAfter you\\'ve enabled IMAP support, create the user account that will be storing the\\nmail:\\n# groupadd vmail\\n# useradd vmail -g vmail -s /bin/true -c \"asterisk voicemail user\" -p vmailsecret\\n-d /var/spool/asterisk/imap-voicemail vmail\\n# chown -R vmail.vmail /var/spool/asterisk/imap-voicemail\\n\\nNow restart Dovecot and Asterisk, and you should be good to go.\\n# service dovecot restart\\n# service asterisk restart\\n\\n The lrh option tells the compiler that this is a Linux Red Hat system. The IP6=4 option tells the compiler\\n\\nthat we don\\'t want to compile in support for IPV6. Read the Makefile for other options. For RHEL 5 or\\nCentOS 5, you should use lr5 instead of lrh.\\n\\n314 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cCongratulations! You\\'ve successfully installed basic IMAP voicemail support with Asterisk! This is just the tip of the iceberg, though. With IMAP voicemail storage, it is\\neasy to implement shared (e.g., departmental) voicemail using shared IMAP folders.\\nMany companies already have departmental email, so having a shared voicemail box\\nis a very natural and logical progression of the technology. With IMAP voicemail storage, each employee can manage several voicemail boxes without becoming confused\\nas to whether a particular voicemail message is for them personally or for a department\\nto which they belong. There is nothing unusual to configure from Asterisk\\'s point of\\nview; you simply call the VoiceMail() application with the desired mailbox and context,\\nand make sure that the department employees have the shared IMAP folder included\\nin their email client\\'s folder list.\\nFinally, you may want to use per-mailbox authorization (i.e., each voicemail box authenticates as a specific user) instead of a global Asterisk IMAP user. Asterisk supports\\nthis through the imapuser and imappassword options in the individual voicemail box\\ndefinition entries:\\n[imapvoicemail]\\n\\nIn this particular example, if a message is left in IMAP mailbox 100 in the\\nimapvoicemail context, Asterisk will authenticate to the IMAP server as sue@exam\\nple.tld, using suesimapsecret as the password. Similarly, bob@example.tld/bobsimap\\nsecret will be used to authenticate if a message is left in mailbox 101 of the same\\nvoicemail context.\\n\\nStoring Voicemail in an ODBC Database\\nIn case you missed it, you can also store voicemail in a database via the ODBC connector. See Chapter 12 for details!\\n\\nAsterisk and Jabber (XMPP)\\nThe name Jabber is actually the original name for the IETF XMPP protocols (RFC\\n3920-3923). Since Jabber is by far a better name than XMPP, the original name has\\nstuck. This protocol was originally designed to be a decentralized, nonproprietary,\\nopen-standards messaging and presence framework. It supports offline message delivery and encryption, and has grown to include voice messaging, which Asterisk supports.\\nIt is interesting to note that in the beginning, Jabber was seen as a competitor to the\\nSIMPLE protocol, which is SIP-based. XMPP is designed as a more general protocol,\\nand is of course XML-based.\\n\\nAsterisk and Jabber (XMPP) | 315\\n\\x0cAsterisk can be configured to utilize XMPP in several capacities. It may utilize XMPP\\nas a presence framework (e.g., Extension 205 is away or on the phone), or, through the\\nvoice messaging framework JINGLE, support full voice communications with other\\nservices such as Google Talk.\\nUnlike other messaging networks such as MSN and Yahoo!, XMPP is decentralized.\\nAnyone may have his own Jabber server and run any number of services on his server.\\nYou send messages in much the same way that you send email: the Jabber server you\\nuse contacts the Jabber server of the other person, and a direct connection is established. If the other person is not online, the message is stored, and when she log in to\\nher Jabber server, any stored messages are delivered. With encryption (the XMPP protocol supports TLS), it is no wonder why many businesses are starting to implement\\ntheir internal messaging networks using this amazing protocol, and Asterisk is able to\\nseamlessly integrate into this communications network.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThat\\'s pretty much all that this chapter is going to teach you, but it\\'s nowhere near all\\nthere is to learn. Hopefully, you are starting to get an idea of how big this Asterisk thing\\nreally is.\\nIn the next chapter, we\\'re going to try and predict the future of telecom, and we\\'ll\\ndiscuss how (and why) we believe that Asterisk is well positioned to play a starring role.\\n\\n316 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0c\\nAsterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\nFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they\\nfight you, then you win.\\n--Mahatma Gandhi\\n\\nWe have arrived at the final chapter of this book. We\\'ve covered a lot, but we hope\\nthat you now realize that we have barely begun to scratch the surface of this phenomenon called Asterisk. To wrap things up, we want to spend some time exploring what\\nwe might see from Asterisk and open source telephony in the near future.\\nWhile prognostication is always a thankless task, we are confident in asserting that\\nopen source communications engines such as Asterisk herald a shift in thinking that\\nwill transform the telecommunications industry. In this chapter, we will discuss some\\nof our reasons for this belief.\\n\\nThe Problems with Traditional Telephony\\nAlthough Alexander Graham Bell is most famously remembered as the father of the\\ntelephone, the reality is that during the latter half of the 1800s, dozens of minds were\\nworking toward the goal of carrying voice over telegraph lines. These people were\\nmostly business-minded folks, looking to create a product through which they might\\nmake their fortunes.\\nWe have come to think of traditional telephone companies as monopolies, but this was\\nnot true in their early days. The early history of telephone service took place in a very\\ncompetitive environment, with new companies springing up all over the world, often\\nwith little or no respect for the patents they might be violating. Many famous monopolies got their start through the waging (and winning) of patent wars.\\nIt\\'s interesting to contrast the history of the telephone with the history of Linux and\\nthe Internet. While the telephone was created as a commercial exercise, and the telecom\\nindustry was forged through lawsuits and corporate takeovers, Linux and the Internet\\narose out of the academic community, which has always valued the sharing of\\nknowledge over profit.\\n\\x0cThe cultural differences are obvious. Telecommunications technologies tend to be\\nclosed, confusing, and expensive, while networking technologies are generally open,\\nwell-documented, and competitive.\\n\\nClosed Thinking\\nIf one compares the culture of the telecommunications industry to that of the Internet,\\nit is sometimes difficult to believe the two are related. The Internet was designed by\\nenthusiasts, whereas contributing to the development of the PSTN is impossible for\\nany individual to contemplate. This is an exclusive club; membership is not open to\\njust anyone.*\\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) clearly exhibits this type of closed\\nthinking. If you want access to its knowledge, you have to be prepared to pay for it.\\nMembership requires proof of your qualifications, and you will be expected to pay\\nthousands of dollars to gain access to its library of publications.\\nAlthough the ITU is the United Nations\\'s sanctioned body responsible for international\\ntelecommunications, many of the VoIP protocols (SIP, MGCP, RTP, STUN) come not\\nfrom the hallowed halls of the ITU, but rather from the IETF (which publishes all of\\nits standards free to all, and allows anyone to submit an Internet Draft for\\nconsideration).\\nOpen protocols such as SIP may have a tactical advantage over ITU protocols, such as\\nH.323, due to the ease with which one can obtain them. Although H.323 is widely\\ndeployed by carriers as a VoIP protocol in the backbone, it is much more difficult to\\nfind H.323-based endpoints; newer products are far more likely to support SIP.\\nThe success of the IETF\\'s open approach has not gone unnoticed by the mighty ITU.\\nIt has recently become possible to download up to three documents free of charge from\\nthe ITU web site.Openness is clearly on its minds. Recent statements by the ITU suggest that there is a desire to achieve \"Greater participation in ITU by civil society and\\nthe academic world.\" Mr. Houlin Zhao, the ITU\\'s Director of the Telecommunication\\nStandardization Bureau (TSB), believes that \"ITU should take some steps to encourage\\nthis.\"\\nThe roadmap to achieving this openness is unclear, but the ITU is beginning to realize\\nthe inevitable.\\n\\n* Contrast this with the IETF\\'s membership page, which states: \"The IETF is not a membership organization\\n\\n(no cards, no dues, no secret handshakes :-)... It is open to any interested individual... Welcome to the IETF.\"\\nTalk about community!\\n Considering the thousands of documents available, and the fact that each document generally contains\\n\\nreferences to dozens more, the value of this free information is difficult to judge.\\n\\n318 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cAs for Asterisk, it embraces both the past and the future: H.323 support is available,\\nalthough the community has for the most part shunned H.323 in favor of the IETF\\nprotocol SIP and the darling of the Asterisk community, IAX.\\n\\nLimited Standards Compliancy\\nOne of the oddest things about all of the standards that exist in the world of legacy\\ntelecommunications is the various manufacturers\\' seeming inability to implement them\\nconsistently. Each manufacturer desires a total monopoly, so the concept of interoperability tends to take a back seat to being first to market with a creative new idea.\\nThe ISDN protocols are a classic example of this. Deployment of ISDN was (and in\\nmany ways still is) a painful and expensive proposition, as each manufacturer decided\\nto implement it in a slightly different way. ISDN could very well have helped to usher\\nin a massive public data network, 10 years before the Internet. Unfortunately, due to\\nits cost, complexity, and compatibility issues, ISDN never delivered much more than\\nvoice, with the occasional video or data connection for those willing to pay. ISDN is\\nquite common (especially in Europe, and in North America in larger PBX implementations), but it is not delivering anywhere near the capabilities that were envisioned for\\nit.\\nAs VoIP becomes more and more ubiquitous, the need for ISDN will disappear.\\n\\nSlow Release Cycles\\nIt can take months, or sometimes years, for the big guys to admit to a trend, let alone\\nrelease a product that is compatible with it. It seems that before a new technology can\\nbe embraced, it must be analyzed to death, and then it must pass successfully through\\nvarious layers of bureaucracy before it is even scheduled into the development cycle.\\nMonths or even years must pass before any useful product can be expected. When those\\nproducts are finally released, they are often based on hardware that is obsolete; they\\nalso tend to be expensive and to offer no more than a minimal feature set.\\nThese slow release cycles simply don\\'t work in today\\'s world of business communications. On the Internet, new ideas can take root in a matter of weeks and become viable\\nin extremely short periods of time. Since every other technology must adapt to these\\nchanges, so too must telecommunications.\\nOpen source development is inherently better able to adapt to rapid technological\\nchange, which gives it an enormous competitive advantage.\\nThe spectacular crash of the telecom industry may have been caused in large part by\\nan inability to change. Perhaps that continued inability is why recovery has been so\\nslow. Now, there is no choice: change, or cease to be. Community-driven technologies\\nsuch as Asterisk will see to that.\\n\\nThe Problems with Traditional Telephony | 319\\n\\x0cRefusing to Let Go of the Past and Embrace the Future\\nTraditional telecommunications companies have lost touch with their customers.\\nWhile the concept of adding functionality beyond the basic telephone is well understood, the idea that the user should be the one defining this functionality is not.\\nNowadays, people have nearly limitless flexibility in every other form of communication. They simply cannot understand why telecommunications cannot be delivered as\\nflexibly as the industry has been promising for so many years. The concept of flexibility\\nis not familiar to the telecom industry, and very well might not be until open source\\nproducts such as Asterisk begin to transform the fundamental nature of the industry.\\nThis is a revolution similar to the one Linux and the Internet willingly started more\\nthan 10 years ago (and IBM unwittingly started with the PC, 15 years before that). What\\nis this revolution? The commoditization of telephony hardware and software, enabling\\na proliferation of tailor-made telecommunications systems.\\n\\nParadigm Shift\\nIn \"Paradigm Shift\" (http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html), Tim\\nO\\'Reilly talks about a paradigm shift that is occurring in the way technology (both\\nhardware and software) is delivered. O\\'Reilly identifies three trends:\\nthe commoditization of software, network-enabled collaboration, and\\nsoftware customizability (software as a service). These three concepts provide evidence\\nto suggest that open source telephony is an idea whose time has come.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony\\nEvery good work of software starts by scratching a developer\\'s personal itch.\\n--Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar\\n\\nIn his book The Cathedral and the Bazaar (O\\'Reilly), Eric S. Raymond explains that\\n\"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\" The reason open source software development produces such consistent quality is simple: crap can\\'t hide.\\n\\nThe Itch That Asterisk Scratches\\nIn this era of custom database and web site development, people are not only tired of\\nhearing that their telephone system \"can\\'t do that,\" they quite frankly just don\\'t believe\\nit. The creative needs of the customers, coupled with the limitations of the technology,\\nhave spawned a type of creativity born of necessity: telecom engineers are like\\n Much of the following section is merely our interpretation of O\\'Reilly\\'s article. To get the full gist of these\\n\\nideas, the full read is highly recommended.\\n\\n320 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0ccontestants in an episode of Junkyard Wars, trying to create functional devices out of\\na pile of mismatched components.\\nThe development methodology of a proprietary telephone system dictates that it will\\nhave a huge number of features, and that the number of features will in large part\\ndetermine the price. Manufacturers will tell you that their products give you hundreds\\nof features, but if you only need five of them, who cares? Worse, if there\\'s one missing\\nfeature you really can\\'t do without, the value of that system will be diluted by the fact\\nthat it can\\'t completely address your needs.\\nThe fact that a customer might only need 5 out of 500 features is ignored, and that\\ncustomer\\'s desire to have 5 unavailable features that address the needs of his business\\nis dismissed as unreasonable. Until flexibility becomes standard, telecom will remain\\nstuck in the last century--all the VoIP in the world notwithstanding.\\nAsterisk addresses that problem directly and solves it in a way that few other telecom\\nsystems can. This is extremely disruptive technology, in large part because it is based\\non concepts that have been proven time and time again: \"the closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders\\nof magnitude more skilled time into a problem.\"#\\n\\nOpen Architecture\\nOne of the stumbling blocks of the traditional telecommunications industry has been\\nits apparent refusal to cooperate with itself. The big telecommunications giants have\\nall been around for over a hundred years. The concept of closed, proprietary systems\\nis so ingrained in their culture that even their attempts at standards compliancy are\\ntainted by their desire to get the jump on the competition, by adding that one feature\\nthat no one else supports. For an example of this thinking, one simply has to look at\\nthe VoIP products being offered by the telecom industry today. While they claim\\nstandards compliance, the thought that you would actually expect to be able to connect\\na Cisco phone to a Nortel switch, or that an Avaya voicemail system could be integrated\\nvia IP to a Siemens PBX, is not one that bears discussing.\\nIn the computer industry, things are different. Twenty years ago, if you bought an IBM\\nserver, you needed an IBM network and IBM terminals to talk to it. Now, that IBM\\nserver is likely to interconnect to Dell terminals though a Cisco network (and run Linux,\\nof all things). Anyone can easily think of thousands of variations on this theme. If any\\n\\n From the perspective of the closed-source industry, this attitude is understandable. In his book\\n\\nThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering (Addison-Wesley), Fred Brooks opined that \"the\\ncomplexity and communication costs of a project rise with the square of the number of developers, while\\nwork done only rises linearly.\" Without a community-based development methodology, it is very difficult to\\ndeliver products that at best are little more than incremental improvements over their predecessors, and at\\nworst are merely collections of patches.\\n# Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony | 321\\n\\x0cone of these companies were to suggest that we could only use their products with\\nwhatever they told us, they would be laughed out of business.\\nThe telecommunications industry is facing the same changes, but it\\'s in no hurry to\\naccept them. Asterisk, on the other hand, is in a big hurry to not only accept change,\\nbut embrace it.\\nCisco, Nortel, Avaya, and Polycom IP phones (to name just a few) have all been successfully connected to Asterisk systems. There is no other PBX in the world today that\\ncan make this claim. None.\\nOpenness is the power of Asterisk.\\n\\nStandards Compliance\\nIn the past few years, it has become clear that standards evolve at such a rapid pace\\nthat to keep up with them requires an ability to quickly respond to emerging technology\\ntrends. Asterisk, by virtue of being an open source, community-driven development\\neffort, is uniquely suited to the kind of rapid development that standards compliance\\ndemands.\\nAsterisk does not focus on cost-benefit analysis or market research. It evolves in response to whatever the community finds exciting--or necessary.\\n\\nLightning-Fast Response to New Technologies\\nAfter Mark Spencer attended his first SIP Interoperability Test (SIPIT) event, he had a\\nrudimentary but working SIP stack for Asterisk coded within a few days. This was\\nbefore SIP had emerged as the protocol of choice in the VoIP world, but he saw its value\\nand momentum and ensured that Asterisk would be ready.\\nThis kind of foresight and flexibility is typical in an open source development community (and very unusual in a large corporation).\\n\\nPassionate Community\\nThe Asterisk-users list receives many email messages per day. More than 10,000 people\\nare subscribed to it. This kind of community support is unheard of in the world of\\nproprietary telecommunications, while in the open source world it is commonplace.\\nThe very first AstriCon event was expected to attract 100 participants. Nearly 500\\nshowed up (far more wanted to but couldn\\'t attend). This kind of community support\\nvirtually guarantees the success of an open source effort.\\n\\n322 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cInbound call to DID\\nPSTN\\n\\nPassed to PBX\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\nRelayed out to\\ncell phone\\n\\nLegacy PBX\\n\\nVoIP call\\n\\n\\nCell phone\\n\\nDelivered to\\nhome office\\n\\nPBX telephone\\nDatabase/Web/\\nApplication server\\n\\nVoIP\\nIP telephone\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\nRemote Asterisk\\n\\nDelivered to\\nremote PBX\\n\\nRemote PBX\\n\\nFigure 15-1.

Let\\'s look at some of the things\\nwe\\'ve come up with.\\n\\nLegacy PBX migration gateway\\nAsterisk can be used as a fantastic bridge between an old PBX and the future. You can\\nplace it in front of the PBX as a gateway (and migrate users off the PBX as needs dictate),\\nor you can put it behind the PBX as a peripheral application server. You can even do\\nboth at the same time, as shown in Figure 15-1.\\nHere are some of the options you can implement:\\nKeep your old PBX, but evolve to IP\\nCompanies that have spent vast sums of money in the past few years buying proprietary PBX equipment want a way out of proprietary jail, but they can\\'t stomach\\nthe thought of throwing away all of their otherwise functioning equipment. No\\nproblem--Asterisk can solve all kinds of dilemmas, from replacing a voicemail\\nsystem to providing a way to add IP-based users beyond the nominal capacity of\\nthe system.\\nFind-me-follow-me\\nProvide the PBX a list of numbers where you can be reached, and it will ring them\\nall whenever a call to your DID (Direct Inward Dialing, a.k.a. phone number)\\narrives.

VoIP-enabling a legacy PBX\\n\\nVoIP calling\\nIf a legacy telephony connection from an Asterisk PBX to an old PBX can be established, Asterisk can provide access to VoIP services, while the old PBX continues\\nto connect to the outside world as it always has. As a gateway, Asterisk simply\\nneeds to emulate the functions of the PSTN, and the old PBX won\\'t know that\\nanything has changed. Figure 15-3 shows how you can use Asterisk to VoIP-enable\\na legacy PBX.\\n\\nLow-barrier IVR\\nMany people confuse the term \"Interactive Voice Response,\" or IVR, with the Automated Attendant (AA). Since the Automated Attendant was the very first thing IVR was\\n324 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cused for, this is understandable. Nevertheless, to the telecom industry, the term IVR\\nrepresents far more than an AA. An AA generally does little more than present a way\\nfor callers to be transferred to extensions, and it is built into most proprietary voicemail\\nsystems--but IVR can be so much more.\\nIVR systems are generally very expensive not only to purchase, but also to configure.\\nA custom IVR system will usually require connectivity to an external database or application. Asterisk is arguably the perfect IVR, as it embraces the concepts of connectivity to databases and applications at its deepest level.\\nHere are a few examples of relatively simple IVRs that an Asterisk system could be used\\nto create:\\nWeather reporting\\nUsing the Internet, you can obtain text-based weather reports from around the\\nworld in a myriad of ways. Capturing these reports and running them through a\\npurpose-built parser (Perl would probably eat this up) would allow the information\\nto be available to the dialplan. Asterisk\\'s sound library already contains all of the\\nrequired prompts, so it would not be an onerous task to produce an interactive\\nmenu to play current forecasts for anywhere in the world.\\nMath programs\\nEd Guy (the architect of Pulver\\'s FWD network) did a presentation at AstriCon\\n2004 in which he talked about a little math program he\\'d cooked up for his daughter to use. The program took him no more than an hour to write. What it did was\\npresent her with a number of math questions, the answers to which she keyed into\\nthe telephone. When all the questions were tabulated, the system presented her\\nwith her score. This extremely simple Asterisk application would cost tens of\\nthousands of dollars to implement on any closed PBX platform, assuming it could\\nbe done at all. See Chapter 9 for further details. As is so often the case, things that\\nare simple for Asterisk would be either impossible or massively expensive with any\\nother IVR system.\\nDistributed IVR\\nThe cost of a proprietary IVR system is such that when a company with many small\\nretail locations wants to provide IVR, it is forced to transfer callers to a central\\nserver to process the transactions. With Asterisk, it becomes possible to distribute\\nthe application to each node and, thus, handle the requests locally. Literally thousands of little Asterisk systems deployed at retail locations across the world could\\nserve up IVR functionality in a way that would be impossible to achieve with any\\nother system. No more long-distance transfers to a central IVR server, no more\\nhuge trunking facility dedicated to the task--more power with less expense.\\nThese are three rather simple examples of the potential of Asterisk.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony | 325\\n\\x0cConference rooms\\nThis little gem is going to end up being one of the killer functions of Asterisk. In the\\nAsterisk community, everyone finds themselves using conference rooms more and\\nmore, for purposes such as these:\\n Small companies need an easy way for business partners to get together for a chat.\\n Sales teams have a meeting once per week where everyone can dial in from wherever\\nthey are.\\n Development teams designate a common place and time to update one another on\\nprogress.\\n\\nHome automation\\nAsterisk is still too much of an ber-geek\\'s tool to be able to serve in the average home,\\nbut with no more than average Linux and Asterisk skills, the following things become\\nplausible:\\nMonitoring the kids\\nParents who want to check up on the babysitter (or the kids home alone) could\\ndial an extension context protected by a password. Once authenticated, a two-way\\naudio connection would be created to all the IP phones in the house, allowing Mom\\nand Dad to listen for trouble. Creepy? Yes. But an interesting concept nonetheless.\\nLocking down your phones\\nGoing out for the night? Don\\'t want the babysitter tying up the phone? No problem!\\nA simple tweak to the dialplan, and the only calls that can be made are to 911, your\\ncell phone, and the pizza parlor. Any other call attempt will get the recording \"We\\nare paying you to babysit our kids, not make personal calls.\"\\nPretty evil, huh?\\nControlling the alarm system\\nYou get a call while on vacation that your Mom wants to borrow some cooking\\nutensils. She forgot her key and is standing in front of the house shivering. Piece\\nof cake; a call to your Asterisk system, a quick digit string into the context you\\ncreated for the purpose, and your alarm system is instructed to disable the alarm\\nfor 15 minutes. Mom better get her stuff and get out quick, though, or the cops\\'ll\\nbe showing up!\\nManaging teenagers\\' calls\\nHow about allocating a specific phone-time limit to your teenagers? To use the\\nphone, they have to enter their access codes. They can earn extra minutes by doing\\nchores, scoring all As, dumping that annoying bum with the bad haircut--you get\\nthe idea. Once they\\'ve used up their minutes... click... you get your phone back.\\nIncoming calls can be managed as well, via Caller ID. \"Donny, this is Suzy\\'s father.\\nShe is no longer interested in seeing you, as she has decided to raise her standards\\na bit. Also, you should consider getting a haircut.\"\\n326 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe Future of Asterisk\\nWe\\'ve come to love the Internet, both because it is so rich in content and inexpensive,\\nand, perhaps more importantly, because it allows us to define how we communicate.\\nAs its ability to carry richer forms of media advances, we\\'ll find ourselves using it more\\nand more. Once Internet voice delivers quality that rivals (or betters) the capabilities\\nof the PSTN, the phone company had better look for another line of business. The\\nPSTN will cease to exist and become little more than one more communications protocol that the Internet happily carries for us. As with most of the rest of the Internet,\\nopen source technologies will lead this transformation.\\n\\nSpeech Processing\\nThe dream of having our technical inventions talk to us is older than the telephone\\nitself. Each new advance in technology spurs a new wave of eager experimentation.\\nGenerally, results never quite meet expectations, possibly because as soon as a machine\\nsays something that sounds intelligent, most people assume that it is intelligent.\\nPeople who program and maintain computers realize their limitations and, thus, tend\\nto allow for their weaknesses. Everybody else just expects their computers and software\\nto work. The amount of thinking a user must do to interact with a computer is often\\ninversely proportional to the amount of thinking the design team did. Simple interfaces\\nbelie complex design decisions.\\nThe challenge, therefore, is to design a system that has anticipated the most common\\ndesires of its users, and that can also adroitly handle unexpected challenges.\\n\\nFestival\\nThe Festival text-to-speech server can transform text into spoken words. While this is\\na whole lot of fun to play with, there are many challenges to overcome.\\nFor Asterisk, an obvious value of text-to-speech might be the ability to have your telephone system read your emails back to you. Of course, if you\\'ve noticed the somewhat\\npoor grammar, punctuation, and spelling typically found in email messages these days,\\nyou can perhaps appreciate the challenges this poses.\\nOne cannot help but wonder if the emergence of text-to-speech will inspire a new\\ngeneration of people dedicated to proper writing. Seeing spelling and punctuation errors on the screen is frustrating enough; having to hear a computer speak such things\\nwill require a level of Zazen that few possess.\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\nIf text-to-speech is rocket science, speech recognition is science fiction.\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 327\\n\\x0cSpeech recognition can actually work very well, but unfortunately this is generally true\\nonly if you provide it with the right conditions--and the right conditions are not those\\nfound on a telephone network. Even a perfect PSTN connection is considered to be at\\nthe lowest acceptable limit for accurate speech recognition. Add in compressed and\\nlossy VoIP connections, or a cell phone, and you will discover far more limitations than\\nuses.\\nAsterisk now has an entire speech API so that outside companies (or even open source\\nprojects) can tie their speech recognition engines into Asterisk. One company that has\\ndone this is LumenVox. By using its speech recognition engine along with Asterisk, you\\ncan make voice-driven menus and IVR systems in record time! For more information,\\nsee http://www.lumenvox.com.\\n\\nHigh-Fidelity Voice\\nAs we gain access to more and more bandwidth, it becomes less and less easy to understand why we still use low-fidelity codecs. Many people do not realize that Skype\\nuses a higher fidelity than a telephone; it\\'s a large part of the reason why Skype has a\\nreputation for sounding so good.\\nIf you were ever to phone CNN, wouldn\\'t you love to hear James Earl Jones\\'s mellifluous voice saying \"This is CNN,\" instead of some tinny electronic recording? And if\\nyou think Allison Smith* sounds good through the phone, you should hear her in person!\\nIn the future, we will expect, and get, high-fidelity voice though our communications\\nequipment.\\nBeginning in Asterisk 1.4, there is limited support for the G.722 codec. As more and\\nmore hardware vendors start building support for high-fidelity voice into their VoIP\\nhardware, you\\'ll see more support in Asterisk for making better-than PSTN quality\\ncalls.\\n\\nVideo\\nWhile most of this book focuses on audio, video is also supported in many ways within\\nAsterisk. Video support is not complete, however. The problem is not so much one of\\nfunctionality as it is one of bandwidth and processing power. More significantly, it is\\nnot yet important enough to the community to merit the attention it needs.\\n\\n* Allison Smith is The Voice of Asterisk; it is her voice in all of the system prompts. To have Allison produce\\n\\nyour own prompt, simply visit http://thevoice.digium.com.\\n\\n328 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe challenge of video-conferencing\\nThe concept of video-conferencing has been around since the invention of the cathode\\nray tube. The telecom industry has been promising a video-conferencing device in every\\nhome for decades.\\nAs with so many other communications technologies, if you have video-conferencing\\nin your house, you are probably running it over the Internet, with a simple, inexpensive\\nwebcam. Still, it seems that people see video-conferencing as a bit gimmicky. Yes, you\\ncan see the person you\\'re talking to, but there\\'s something missing.\\n\\nWhy we love video-conferencing\\nVideo-conferencing promises a richer communications experience than the telephone.\\nRather than hearing a disembodied voice, the nuances of speech that come from eyeto-eye communication are possible.\\n\\nWhy video-conferencing may never totally replace voice\\nThere are some challenges to overcome, though, and not all of them are technical.\\nConsider this: using a plain telephone, people working from their home offices can\\nhave business conversations, unshowered, in their underwear, feet on the desk, coffee\\nin hand. A similar video conversation would require half an hour of grooming to prepare\\nfor, and couldn\\'t happen in the kitchen, on the patio, or... well, you get the idea.\\nAlso, the promise of eye-to-eye communication over video will never happen as long\\nas the focal points of the participants are not in line with the cameras. If you look at\\nthe camera, your audience will see you looking at them, but you won\\'t see them. If you\\nlook at your screen to see whom you are talking to, the camera will show you looking\\ndown at something--not at your audience. That looks impersonal. Perhaps if a videophone could be designed like a TelePromptR, where the camera was behind the screen,\\nit wouldn\\'t feel so unnatural. As it stands, there\\'s something psychological that\\'s missing. Video ends up being a gimmick.\\n\\nWireless\\nSince Asterisk is fully VoIP-enabled, wireless is all part of the package.\\n\\nWi-Fi\\nWi-Fi is going to be the office mobility solution for VoIP phones. This technology is\\nalready quite mature. The biggest hurdle is the cost of handsets, which can be expected\\nto improve as competitive pressure from around the world drives down prices.\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 329\\n\\x0cWi-MAX\\nSince we are so bravely predicting so many things, it\\'s not hard to predict that Wi-MAX\\nspells the beginning of the end for traditional cellular telephone networks.\\nWith wireless Internet access within the reach of most communities, what value will\\nthere be in expensive cellular service?\\n\\nUnified Messaging\\nThis is a term that has been hyped by the telecom industry for years, but adoption has\\nbeen far slower than predicted.\\nUnified Messaging is the concept of tying voice and text-messaging systems into one.\\nWith Asterisk, the two don\\'t need to be artificially combined, as Asterisk already treats\\nthem the same way.\\nJust by examining the terms, unified and messaging, we can see that the integration of\\nemail and voicemail must be merely the beginning; Unified Messaging needs to do a\\nlot more than just that if it is to deserve its name.\\nPerhaps we need to define \"messaging\" as communication that does not occur in real\\ntime. In other words, when you send a message, you expect that the reply may take\\nmoments, minutes, hours, or even days to arrive. You compose what you wish to say,\\nand your audience is expected to compose a reply.\\nContrast this with conversing, which happens in real time. When you talk to someone\\non a telephone connection, you expect no more than a few seconds\\' delay before the\\nresponse arrives.\\nIn 2002, Tim O\\'Reilly delivered a speech titled \"Watching the Alpha Geeks: OS X and\\nthe Next Big Thing\" (http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreil\\nly_wwdc_keynote.html), in which he talked about someone piping IRC through a textto-speech engine. One could imagine doing the reverse as well, allowing us to join an\\nIRC or instant messaging chat over our Wi-Fi phone, our Asterisk PBX providing the\\nspeech-to-text-to-speech translations.\\n\\nPeering\\nAs monopoly networks such as the PSTN give way to community-based networks like\\nthe Internet, there will be a period of time where it is necessary to interconnect the two.\\nWhile the traditional providers would prefer that the existing model be carried into the\\nnew paradigm, it is increasingly likely that telephone calls will become little more than\\nanother application the Internet happily carries.\\nBut a challenge remains: how to manage the telephone numbering plan with which we\\nare all familiar and comfortable?\\n\\n330 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe ITU defined a numbering plan in its E.164 specification. If you\\'ve used a telephone\\nto make a call across the PSTN, you can confidently state that you are familiar with the\\nconcept of E.164 numbering. Prior to the advent of publicly available VoIP, nobody\\ncared about E.164 except the telephone companies--nobody needed to.\\nNow that calls are hopping from PSTN to Internet to who-knows-what, some consideration must be given to E.164.\\n\\nENUM\\nIn response to this challenge, the IETF has sponsored the Telephone Number Mapping\\n(ENUM) working group, the purpose of which is to map E.164 numbers into the Domain Name System (DNS).\\nWhile the concept of ENUM is sound, it requires cooperation from the telecom industry\\nto achieve success. However, cooperation is not what the telecom industry is famous\\nfor and, thus, far ENUM has foundered.\\n\\nThe folks at e164.org are trying to contribute to the success of ENUM. You can log on\\nto this site, register your phone number, and inform the system of alternative methods\\nof communicating with you. This means that someone who knows your phone number\\ncan connect a VoIP call to you, as the e164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing\\nand protocol information needed to connect to your location.\\nAs more and more people publish VoIP connectivity information, fewer and fewer calls\\nwill be connected through the PSTN.\\n\\nDUNDi\\nDistributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) is an open routing protocol designed to maintain dynamic telecom routing tables between compatible systems (see\\nChapter 14 for more information). While Asterisk is currently the only PBX to support\\nDUNDi, the openness of the standard ensures that anyone can implement it.\\nDUNDi has huge potential, but it is very much in its infancy. This is the one to watch.\\n\\nChallenges\\nAs is true with any worthwhile thing, Asterisk will face challenges. Let\\'s take a glance\\nat what some of them may be.\\n\\nToo much change, too few standards\\nThese days, the Internet is changing so fast, and offers so much diverse content, that it\\nis impossible for even the most attentive geek to keep on top of it all. While this is as\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 331\\n\\x0cit should be, it also means that an enormous amount of technology churn is an inevitable part of keeping any communications system current.\\n\\nVoIP spam\\nYes, it\\'s coming. There will always be people who believe they have the right to inconvenience and harass others in their pursuit of money. Efforts are under way to try and\\naddress this, but only time will tell how efficacious they will be.\\n\\nFear, uncertainty, and doubt\\nThe industry is making the transition from ignorance to laughter. If Gandhi is correct,\\nwe can expect the fight to begin soon.\\nAs their revenue streams become increasingly threatened by open source telephony,\\nthe traditional industry players are certain to mount a fear campaign, in hopes of undermining the revolution.\\n\\nBottleneck engineering\\nThere is a rumor making the rounds that the major network providers will begin to\\nartificially cripple VoIP traffic by tagging and prioritizing the traffic of their premium\\nVoIP services and, worse, detecting and bumping any VoIP traffic generated by services\\nnot approved by them.\\nSome of this is already taking place, with service providers blocking traffic of certain\\ntypes through their networks, ostensibly due to some public service being rendered\\n(such as blocking popular file-sharing services to protect us from piracy). In the United\\nStates, the FCC has taken a clear stand on the matter and fined companies that engage\\nin such practices. In the rest of the world, regulatory bodies are not always as accepting\\nof VoIP.\\nWhat seems clear is that the community and the network will find ways around blockages, just as they always have.\\n\\nRegulatory wars\\nThe recently departed Chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission, Michael Powell, delivered a gift that may well have altered the path of the VoIP\\nrevolution. Rather than attempting to regulate VoIP as a telecom service, he has championed the concept that VoIP represents an entirely new way of communicating and\\nrequires its own regulatory space in which to evolve.\\nVoIP will become regulated, but not everywhere as a telephony service. Some of the\\nregulations that may be created include:\\n\\n332 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cPresence information for emergency services\\nOne of the characteristics of a traditional PSTN circuit is that it is always in the\\nsame location. This is very helpful to emergency services, as they can pinpoint the\\nlocation of a caller by identifying the address of the circuit from which the call was\\nplaced. The proliferation of cell phones has made this much more difficult to achieve, since a cell phone does not have a known address. A cell phone can be plugged\\ninto any network and can register to any server. If the phone does not identify its\\nphysical location, an emergency call from it will provide no clue as to the where\\nthe caller is. VoIP creates similar challenges.\\nCall monitoring for law enforcement agencies\\nLaw enforcement agencies have always been able to obtain wiretaps on traditional\\ncircuit-switched telephone lines. While regulations are being enacted that are designed to achieve the same end on the network, the technical challenge of delivering\\nthis functionality will probably never be completely solved. People value their privacy, and the more governments want to stifle it, the more effort will be put toward\\nmaintaining it.\\nAnti-monopolistic practices\\nThese practices are already being seen in the U.S., with fines being levied against\\nnetwork providers who attempt to filter traffic based on content.\\nWhen it comes to regulation, Asterisk is both a saint and a devil: a saint because it feeds\\nthe poor, and a devil because it empowers the phrackers and spammers like nothing\\never has. The regulation of open source telephony may in part be determined by how\\nwell the community regulates itself. Concepts such as DUNDi, which incorporate antispam processes, are an excellent start. On the other hand, concepts such as Caller IDspoofing are ripe with opportunities for abuse.\\n\\nQuality of service\\nDue to the best-effort reality of the TCP/IP-based Internet, it is not yet known how well\\nincreasing realtime VoIP traffic will affect overall network performance. Currently,\\nthere is so much excess bandwidth in the backbone that best-effort delivery is generally\\nquite good indeed. Still, it has been proven time and time again that whenever we are\\nprovided with more bandwidth, we figure out a way to use it up. The 1 MB DSL connection undreamt of five years ago is now barely adequate.\\nPerhaps a corollary of Moore\\'s Law will apply to network bandwidth. QoS may become moot, due to the network\\'s ability to deliver adequate performance without any\\nspecial processing. Organizations that require higher levels of reliability may elect to\\npay a premium for a higher grade of service. Perhaps the era of paying by the minute\\nfor long-distance connections will give way to paying by the millisecond for guaranteed\\nlow latency, or by the percentage point for reduced packet loss. Premium services will\\n\\n Gordon Moore wrote a paper in 1965 that predicted the doubling of transistors on a processor every few years.\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 333\\n\\x0coffer the five-nines reliability the traditional telecom companies have always touted as\\ntheir advantage over VoIP.\\n\\nComplexity\\nOpen systems require new approaches toward solution design. Just because the hardware and software are cheap doesn\\'t mean the solution will be. Asterisk does not come\\nout of the box ready to run; it has to be designed and built, and then maintained. While\\nthe base software is free, and the hardware costs will be based on commodity pricing,\\nit is fair to say that the configuration costs for a highly customized system will be a\\nsizeable part of the solution costs--in many cases, because of its high degree of complexity and configurability, more than would be expected with a traditional PBX.\\nThe rule of thumb is generally considered to be something like this: if it can be done\\nin the dialplan, the system design will be roughly the same as for any similarly featured\\ntraditional PBX. Beyond that, only experience will allow one to accurately estimate the\\ntime required to build a system.\\nThere is much to learn.\\n\\nOpportunities\\nOpen source telephony creates limitless opportunities. Here are some of the more\\ncompelling ones.\\n\\nTailor-made private telecommunications networks\\nSome people would tell you that price is the key, but we believe that the real reason\\nAsterisk will succeed is because it is now possible to build a telephone system as one\\nwould a web site: with complete, total customization of each and every facet of the\\nsystem. Customers have wanted this for years. Only Asterisk can deliver.\\n\\nLow barrier to entry\\nAnyone can contribute to the future of communicating. It is now possible for someone\\nwith an old $200 PC to develop a communications system that has intelligence to rival\\nthe most expensive proprietary systems. Granted, the hardware would not be production-ready, but there is no reason the software couldn\\'t be. This is one of the reasons\\nwhy closed systems will have a hard time competing. The sheer number of people who\\nhave access to the required equipment is impossible to equal in a closed shop.\\n This term refers to 99.999%, which is touted as the reliability of traditional telecom networks. Achieving five\\n\\nnines requires that service interruptions for an entire year total no more than 5 minutes and 15 seconds. Many\\npeople believe that VoIP will need to achieve this level of reliability before it can be expected to fully replace\\nthe PSTN. Many other people believe that the PSTN doesn\\'t even come close to five-nines reliability. We\\nbelieve that this could have been an excellent term to describe high reliability, but marketing departments\\nabuse it far too frequently.\\n\\n334 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cHosted solutions of similar complexity to corporate web sites\\nThe design of a PBX was always a kind of art form, but before Asterisk, the art lay in\\nfinding creative ways to overcome the limitations of the technology. With limitless\\ntechnology, those same creative skills can now be properly applied to the task of completely answering the needs of the customer. Open source telephony engines such as\\nAsterisk will enable this. Telecom designers will dance for joy, as their considerable\\ncreative skills will now actually serve the needs of their customers, rather than be focused on managing kludge.\\n\\nProper integration of communications technologies\\nUltimately, the promise of open source comes to nothing if it cannot fulfill the need\\npeople have to solve problems. The closed industries lost sight of the customer and\\ntried to fit the customer to the product.\\nOpen source telephony brings voice communications in line with other information\\ntechnologies. It is finally possible to properly begin the task of integrating email, voice,\\nvideo, and anything else we might conceive of over flexible transport networks (whether\\nwired or wireless), in response to the needs of the user, not the whims of monopolies.\\nWelcome to the future of telecom!\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 335\\n\\x0c\\x0cAPPENDIX A\\n\\nVoIP Channels\\n\\nVoIP channels in Asterisk represent connections to the protocols they support. Each\\nprotocol you wish to use requires a configuration file, containing general parameters\\ndefining how your system handles the protocol as well as specific parameters for each\\nchannel (or device) you will want to reference in your dialplan. In this appendix, we\\'ll\\ntake an in-depth look at the IAX and SIP configuration files.\\n\\nIAX\\nThe IAX configuration file (iax.conf) contains all of the configuration information Asterisk needs to create and manage IAX protocol channels. The sections in the file are\\nseparated by headings, which are formed by a word framed in square brackets ([]). The\\nname in the brackets will be the name of the channel, with one notable exception: the\\n[general] section, which is not a channel, is the area where global protocol parameters\\nare defined.\\nThis section examines the various general and channel-specific settings for iax.conf.\\nWe will define each parameter and then give an example of its use. Certain options\\nmay have several valid arguments. These arguments are listed beside the option, separated with the pipe symbol (|). For example, bandwidth=low|medium|high means that\\nthe bandwidth option accepts one of the values low, medium, or high as its argument.\\nYou can insert comments anywhere in the iax.conf file, by preceding the comment text\\nwith the semicolon character (;). Everything to the right of the semicolon will be ignored. Feel free to use comments liberally.\\n\\nGeneral IAX Settings\\nThe first non-comment line in your iax.conf file must be the heading [general]. The\\nparameters in this section will apply to all connections using this protocol, unless defined differently in a specific channel\\'s definition. Since some of these settings can be\\ndefined on a per-channel basis, we have identified settings that are always global with\\nthe tag \"(global)\" and those that can optionally be configured for individual channels\\n\\x0cwith the tag \"(channel).\" If you define a channel parameter under the [general] section,\\nyou do not need to define it in each channel; its value becomes the default. Keep in\\nmind that setting a parameter in the [general] section does not prevent you from setting\\nit differently for specific channels; it merely makes this setting the default. Also keep\\nin mind that not defining these parameters may, in some cases, cause a system default\\nto be used instead.\\nHere are the parameters that you can configure:\\naccountcode (channel)\\n\\nThe account code can be defined on a per-user basis. If defined, this account code\\nwill be assigned to a call record whenever no specific user account code is set. The\\naccountcode name configured will be used as the filename.csv in\\nthe /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/ directory to store Call Detail Records (CDRs) for the\\nuser/peer/friend:\\naccountcode=iax-username\\n\\nadsi (channel)\\n\\nSupport for ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) can be enabled if you have\\nADSI-compatible CPE equipment:\\nadsi=yes|no\\n\\nallow and disallow (channel)\\n\\nSpecific codecs can be allowed or disallowed, limiting codec use to those preferred\\nby the system designer. allow and disallow can also be defined on a per-channel\\nbasis. Keep in mind that allow statements in the [general] section will carry over\\nto each of the channels, unless you reset with a disallow=all. Codec negotiation\\nis attempted in the order in which the codecs are defined. Best practice suggests\\nthat you define disallow=all, followed by explicit allow statements for each codec\\nyou wish to use. If nothing is defined, allow=all is assumed:\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ilbc\\n\\namaflags (channel)\\n\\nAutomatic Message Accounting (AMA) is defined in the Telcordia Family of Documents listed under FR-AMA-1. These documents specify standard mechanisms for\\ngeneration and transmission of CDRs. You can specify one of four AMA flags to\\napply to all IAX connections:\\namaflags=default|omit|billing|documentation\\n\\nauthdebug (global)\\n\\nYou can minimize the amount of authorization debugging by disabling it with\\nauthdebug=no. Authorization debugging is enabled by default if not explicitly\\ndisabled:\\n338 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cauthdebug=no\\n\\nautokill (global)\\n\\nTo minimize the danger of stalling when a host is unreachable, you can set\\nautokill to yes to specify that any new connection should be torn down if an ACK\\nis not received within 2,000 ms. (This is obviously not advised for hosts with high\\nlatency.) Alternatively, you can replace yes with the number of milliseconds to wait\\nbefore considering a peer unreachable. autokill configures the wait for all IAX2\\npeers, but you can configure it differently for individual peers with the use of the\\nqualify command:\\n\\nbandwidth (channel)\\nbandwidth is a shortcut that may help you get around using disallow=all and multiple allow statements to specify which codecs to use. The valid options are:\\nhigh\\n\\nAllows all codecs (G.723.1, GSM, law, alaw, G.726, ADPCM, slinear, LPC10,\\nG.729, Speex, iLBC)\\n\\nmedium\\n\\nAllows all codecs except slinear, law, and alaw\\n\\nlow\\n\\nAllows all medium codecs except G.726 and ADPCM\\nbandwidth=low|medium|high\\n\\nbindport and bindaddr (global)\\n\\nThese optional parameters allow you to control the IP interface and port on which\\nyou wish to accept IAX connections. If omitted, the port will be set to 4569, and\\nall IP addresses in your Asterisk system will accept incoming IAX connections. If\\nmultiple bind addresses are configured, only the defined interface will accept IAX\\nconnections.* The address 0.0.0.0 tells Asterisk to listen on all interfaces:\\n\\ncodecpriority (channel)\\nThe codecpriority option controls which end of an inbound call leg will have\\npriority over the negotiation of codecs. If set in the [general] section, the selected\\n\\noptions will be inherited by all user entries in the channel configuration file; however, they can be defined in the individual user entries for more granular control.\\nIf set in both the [general] and user sections, the user entry will override the entry\\n\\n* Currently, Asterisk will only work with a single bindaddr option. If you wish to listen to more than one address,\\n\\nyou\\'ll need to use 0.0.0.0. Note that Asterisk will work in a multihomed environment, but not with multiaddress interfaces. Asterisk will use the system\\'s routing table to select which interface it sends the packet\\nout on and it will use the primary address on that interface as the source.\\n\\nIAX | 339\\n\\x0cthat is configured in the [general] section. If this parameter is not configured, the\\nvalue defaults to host.\\nValid options include:\\ncaller\\n\\nThe inbound caller has priority over the host.\\nhost\\n\\nThe host has priority over the inbound caller.\\ndisabled\\n\\nCodec preferences are not considered; this is the default behavior before the\\nimplementation of codec preferences.\\nreqonly\\n\\nCodec preferences are ignored, and the call is accepted only if the requested\\ncodec is available:\\ncodecpriority=caller|host|disabled|reqonly\\n\\ndelayreject (global)\\n\\nIf an incorrect password is received on an IAX channel, this will delay the sending\\nof the REGREQ or AUTHREP reject messages, which will help to secure against bruteforce password attacks. The delay time is 1,000 ms:\\ndelayreject=yes|no\\n\\nforcejitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nSince Asterisk attempts to bridge channels (endpoints) directly together, the endpoints are normally allowed to perform jitter buffering themselves. However, if the\\nendpoints have a poor jitter buffer implementation, you may wish to force Asterisk\\nto perform jitter buffering no matter what. You can force jitter buffering to be\\nperformed with forcejitterbuffer=yes:\\nforcejitterbuffer=yes\\n\\niaxthreads and iaxmaxthreads (global)\\nThe iaxthreads setting specifies the number of IAX helper threads that are created\\n\\non startup to handle IAX communications.\\nThe iaxmaxthreads setting specifies the maximum number of additional IAX helper\\nthreads that may be spawned to handle higher IAX traffic levels:\\n\\njitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nJitter refers to the varying latency between packets. When packets are sent from\\nan end device, they are sent at a constant rate with very little latency variation.\\nHowever, as the packets traverse the Internet, the latency between the packets may\\nbecome varied; thus, they may arrive at the destination at different times, and\\npossibly even out of order.\\n340 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cThe jitter buffer is, in a sense, a staging area where the packets can be reordered\\nand delivered in a regulated stream. Without a jitter buffer, the user may perceive\\nanomalies in the stream, experienced as static, strange sound effects, garbled\\nwords, or, in severe cases, missed words or syllables.\\nThe jitter buffer affects only data received from the far end. Any data you transmit\\nwill not be affected by your jitter buffer, as the far end will be responsible for the\\nde-jittering of its incoming connections.\\nThe jitter buffer is enabled with the use of jitterbuffer=yes:\\njitterbuffer=yes|no\\n\\nlanguage (channel)\\n\\nThis sets the language flag to whatever you define. The global default language is\\nEnglish. The language that is set is sent by the channel as an information element.\\nIt is also used by applications such as SayNumber() that have different files for different languages. Keep in mind that languages other than English are not explicitly\\ninstalled on the system, and it is up to you to configure the system to ensure that\\nthe language you specify is handled properly:\\nlanguage=en\\n\\nmailboxdetail (global)\\nIf mailboxdetail is set to yes, the new/old message count is sent to the user, instead\\nof a simple statement of whether new and old messages exist. mailboxdetail can\\n\\nalso be set on a per-peer basis:\\nmailboxdetail=yes\\n\\nmaxjitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nThis parameter is used to set the maximum size of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds.\\nBe sure not to set maxjitterbuffer too high, or you will needlessly increase your\\nlatency:\\n\\nmaxjitterinterps (channel)\\n\\nThe maximum number of interpolation frames the jitter buffer should return in a\\nrow. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to indicate silence, the jitter\\nbuffer will assume silence has begun after returning this many interpolations. This\\nprevents interpolating throughout a long silence:\\n\\nmaxregexpire and minregexpire (channel)\\n\\nSpecifies the maximum and minimum time intervals for registration expiration, in\\nseconds:\\n\\nIAX | 341\\n\\x0cmohinterpret (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies a preference for which music-on-hold class this channel\\nshould listen to when put on hold if the music class has not been set on the channel\\nwith Set(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan, and the peer channel\\nputting this all on hold did not suggest a music class.\\nIf this option is set to passthrough, then the hold message will always be passed\\nthrough as signaling instead of generating hold music locally.\\nThis option may be specified globally, or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohinterpret=default\\n\\nmohsuggest (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies which music-on-hold class (as defined in musiconhold.conf)\\nto suggest to the peer channel when this channel places the peer on hold. It may\\nbe specified globally or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohsuggest=default\\n\\nnochecksums (global)\\n\\nIf set, Asterisk will disable the calculation of UDP checksums and no longer check\\nUDP checksums on systems supporting this feature:\\nnochecksums=yes\\n\\nregcontext (channel)\\n\\nBy specifying the context that contains the actions to perform, you can configure\\nAsterisk to perform a number of actions when a peer registers to your server. This\\noption works in conjunction with regexten, which specifies the extension to execute. If no regexten is configured, the peer name is used as the extension. Asterisk\\nwill dynamically create and destroy a NoOp at priority 1 for the extension. All actions\\nto be performed upon registration should start at priority 2. More than one\\nregexten may be supplied, if separated by an &. regcontext can be set on a per-peer\\nbasis or globally:\\nregcontext=registered-phones\\n\\nregexten (channel)\\nThe regexten option is used in conjunction with regcontext to specify the extension\\nto be executed within the configured context. If regexten is not explicitly config-\\n\\nured, the peer name is used as the extension to match:\\nregexten=myphone\\n\\nresyncthreshold (channel)\\n\\nThe resynchronize threshold is used to resynchronize the jitter buffer if a significant\\nchange is detected over a few frames, assuming that the change was caused by a\\ntimestamp mixup. The resynchronization threshold is defined as the measured\\njitter plus the resyncthreshold value, defined in milliseconds:\\n\\n342 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0crtautoclear (global)\\n\\nThis specifies whether or not Asterisk should auto-expire friends created on the fly\\non the same schedule as if they had just registered. If set to yes, when the registration expires, the friend will vanish from the configuration until requested again. If\\nset to an integer, friends expire within that number of seconds instead of the normal\\nregistration interval:\\nrtautoclear=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nrtcachefriends (global)\\nIf rtcachefriends is turned on, Asterisk will cache friends that come from the re-\\n\\naltime engine, just as if they had come from iax.conf.

The reduction in overhead makes the IAX2 protocol\\nmore efficient when sending multiple streams to the same endpoint (usually another Asterisk server):\\ntrunk=yes|no\\n\\ntrunkfreq (channel)\\ntrunkfreq is used to control how frequently you send trunk messages, in milliseconds. Trunk messages are sent in conjunction with the trunk=yes command:\\n\\nIAX | 343\\n\\x0ctrunktimestamps (channel)\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should send timestamps for the individual subframes within trunk frames. There is a small bandwidth penalty for sending these\\ntimestamps (less than 1 kbps/call), but they ensure that frame timestamps get sent\\nend-to-end properly. If both ends of all your trunks go directly to TDM and your\\ntrunkfreq equals the frame length for your codecs, you can probably suppress\\nthese. The receiver must also support this feature, although it does not also need\\nto have it enabled:\\ntrunktimestamps=yes|no\\n\\nRetrieving Dialplan Information from a Remote Asterisk Box\\nAsterisk can retrieve dialplan information from another Asterisk box with the use of a\\nswitch => statement. When this occurs, the Asterisk IAX channel driver must wait for\\na reply from the remote box before it can continue with other IAX-related processes.\\nThis is especially troubling when you have multiple switch statements nested throughout multiple boxes: if a switch statement has to traverse several boxes, there could be\\nan appreciable delay before a result is returned.\\nWhen the global iaxcompat option is set to yes, Asterisk will spawn a separate thread\\nwhen the switch lookup is being performed. The use of this thread allows the main IAX\\nchannel driver to continue on with other processes while the thread waits for the reply.\\nA small performance hit is incurred with this option:\\niaxcompat=yes|no\\n\\nRegistering to Other Servers with register Statements\\nThe register switch (register =>) is used to register your Asterisk box to a remote server\\n--this lets the remote end know where you are, in case you are configured with a\\ndynamic IP address. Note that register statements are used only when the remote end\\nhas you configured as a peer, and when host=dynamic.\\nThe basic format for a register statement is:\\nregister => username:password@remote-host\\n\\nThe password is optional (if not configured on the remote system).\\nAlternatively, you can specify an RSA key by framing the appropriate RSA key name\\nin square brackets ([]):\\nregister => username:[rsa-key-name]@remote-host\\n\\n Asterisk RSA keys are typically located in /var/lib/asterisk/keys/. You can generate your own keys using the\\n\\nastkeygen script.\\n\\n344 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cBy default, register requests will be sent via port 4569. You can direct them to a different port by explicitly specifying it, as follows:\\nregister => username:password@remote-host:1234\\n\\nIAX Channel Definitions\\nWith the general settings defined, we can now define our channels. Defining a guest\\nchannel is recommended whenever you want to accept anonymous IAX calls. This is\\na very common way for folks in the Asterisk community to contact one another. Before\\nyou decide that this is not for you, keep in mind that anyone whom you want to be able\\nto connect to you via IAX (without you specifically configuring an account for them)\\nwill need to connect as a guest. This account, in effect, becomes your \"IAX phone\\nnumber.\" Your guest channel definition should look something like this:\\n[guest]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=incoming\\ncallerid=\"Incoming IAX Guest\"\\n\\nNo doubt the spammers will find a way to harass these addresses, but\\nin the short term this has not proven to be a problem. In the long term,\\nwe\\'ll probably use DUNDi (see Chapter 14 for more information).\\n\\nIf you wish to accept calls from the Free World Dialup network, Asterisk comes with\\na predefined security key that ensures that anonymous connections cannot spoof an\\nincoming Free World Dialup call. You\\'ll want to set up an iaxfwd channel:\\n[iaxfwd]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=incoming\\nauth=rsa\\ninkeys=freeworlddialup\\n\\nIf you have resources advertised on a DUNDi network, the associated user must be\\ndefined in iax.conf:\\n[dundi]\\ntype=user\\ndbsecret=dundi/secret\\ncontext=dundi-incoming\\n\\nIf you have IAX-based devices (such as an IAXy), or IAX-based users at a remote node,\\nyou may want to provide them with their own user definition with which to connect\\nto the system.\\nLet\\'s say you have a user on a remote node for whom you want to define an IAX user.\\nWe\\'ll call this hypothetical user sushi. The user definition might look something like\\nthis:\\n\\nIAX | 345\\n\\x0c[sushi]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=local_users\\nsecret=wasabi\\ntransfer=no\\njitterbuffer=yes\\naccountcode=seaweed\\nlanguage=en\\n\\nIAX Authentication\\nIAX provides authentication mechanisms to allow for a reasonable level of security\\nbetween endpoints. This does not mean that the audio information cannot be captured\\nand decoded, but it does mean that you can more carefully control who is allowed to\\nmake connections to your system. Three levels of security are supported on IAX channels. The auth option defines which authentication method to use on the channel:\\nplaintext, md5, or rsa.\\nplaintext, in IAX, offers very little security. While it will prevent connection to the\\n\\nchannel unless a valid password is supplied, the fact that the password is stored in\\niax.conf in plain text and is transmitted and received as plain text makes this a very\\ninsecure authentication method.\\nmd5 improves the security on the network connection; however, both ends still require\\na plain-text secret in the iax.conf file. Here\\'s how it works: Box A requests a connection\\n\\nwith Box B, which in turn replies with an authorization request including a randomly\\ngenerated number. Box A then generates an MD5 hash using the value supplied in the\\nsecret field of iax.conf and the random number from Box B. The hash is returned in\\nthe authorization reply, and Box B compares it to the hash it generated locally. If the\\nhashes match, authorization is granted.\\nThe rsa method provides the most security. Before using RSA authentication, each end\\nmust create a public and private key pair through the astgenkey script, typically located\\nin /usr/src/asterisk/contrib/scripts/. The public key must then be given to the far end.\\nEach end of the circuit must include the public key of the far end in its channel definition, using the inkeys and outkey parameters.\\nRSA keys are stored in /var/lib/asterisk/keys/. Public keys are named name.pub; private\\nkeys are named name.key. Private keys must be encrypted with 3DES.\\n\\nIncoming calls from this user will arrive in the context local_users and will ask the\\nsystem to accept the Caller ID Happy Tempura <(800) 555-1234>. The system will be\\nwilling to accept MD5, plain-text, or RSA authentication from this user, so long as the\\npassword wasabi is provided and the call comes from the IP address 192.168.1.100. All\\ncalls related to this channel will be assigned the account code seaweed.

Trunking disabled\\n\\nset transfer to no, the media path for this channel will always pass through Asterisk;\\nit cannot be redirected to another IAX node.\\nIf you yourself are a remote node, and you need to connect into a remote node as a\\nuser, you would define that main node as your peer:\\n[sashimi_platter]\\ntype=peer\\nusername=sushi\\nsecret=wasabi\\nqualify=yes\\ntrunk=yes\\n\\nA peer is called from the dialplan by using Dial() with the name contained in square\\nbrackets. If you need to authenticate to the peer with a username, you can set that\\nusername and secret in the username and secret fields.\\nRemember, an incoming call from a user specified in iax.conf must authenticate using the name specified in square brackets. When Asterisk\\nitself is calling to an outside peer however, you can use the username\\nsetting to set the authentication username.\\n\\nhost is specified using either IP dotted notation or a fully qualified domain name\\n\\n(FQDN). You can determine the latency between you and the remote host, and whether\\nthe peer is alive, with qualify=yes. To minimize the amount of overhead for multiple\\ncalls going to the same peer, you can trunk them.\\nTrunking is unique to IAX and is designed to take advantage of the fact that two large\\nsites may have multiple, simultaneous VoIP connections between them. IAX trunking\\nreduces overhead by loading the audio from several concurrent calls into each signaling\\npacket. You can enable trunking for a channel with trunk=yes in iax.conf.\\nFigure A-1 shows a channel with trunking disabled, and Figure A-2 shows a channel\\nwith trunking enabled.\\n\\nChannel-specific parameters\\nNow, let\\'s take a look at the channel-specific parameters:\\n You can think of IAX trunking as carpooling for VoIP packets. This becomes very useful in many situations,\\n\\nas the IP overhead (UDP headers, IP headers, and so forth) is often bigger than the audio payload it carries.\\nIf you have several concurrent calls between two Asterisk boxes, you definitely want to turn on IAX trunking!\\n\\nIAX | 347\\n\\x0cSignaling and\\nframing (overhead)\\n\\nPayload\\n(voice)\\n\\nPayload\\n(voice)\\n\\nPayload\\n(voice)\\n\\nFigure A-2. Trunking enabled\\n\\ncallerid\\n\\nYou can set a suggested Caller ID string for a user or peer with callerid. If you\\ndefine a Caller ID field for a user, any calls that come in on that channel will have\\nthat Caller ID assigned to them, regardless of what the far end sends to you. If you\\ndefine Caller ID for a peer, you are requesting that the far end use that to identify\\nyou (although you have no way of ensuring it will do so). If you want incoming\\nusers to be able to define their own Caller IDs (i.e., for guests), make sure you do\\nnot set the callerid field:\\n\\ndefaultip\\nThe defaultip setting complements host=dynamic. If a host has not yet registered\\n\\nwith your server, you\\'ll attempt to send messages to the default IP address configured here:\\n\\ninkeys\\n\\nYou can use the inkeys option to authenticate a user with the use of an RSA key.\\nTo associate more than one RSA key with a user channel definition, separate the\\nkey names with a colon (:). Any one of those keys will be sufficient to validate a\\nconnection. The \"inkey\" is the public key you distribute to your users:\\ninkeys=server_one:server_two\\n\\nmailbox\\n\\nIf you associate a mailbox with a peer within the channel definition, voicemail will\\nsend a message waiting indication (MWI) to the nodes on the end of that channel.\\nIf the mailbox number is in a voicemail context other than default, you can specify\\nit as mailbox @ context. To associate multiple mailboxes with a single peer, use\\nmultiple mailbox statements:\\n\\noutkey\\n\\nYou can use the outkey option to authenticate a peer with the use of an RSA key.\\nOnly one RSA key may be used for outgoing authentication. The \"outkey\" is not\\ndistributed; it is your private key:\\noutkey=private_key\\n\\n348 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cqualify\\n\\nYou can set qualify to yes, no, or a time in milliseconds. If you set qualify=yes,\\nPING messages will be sent periodically to the remote peers to determine whether\\nthey are available and what the latency between replies is. The peers will respond\\nwith PONG messages. A peer will be determined unreachable if no reply is received\\nwithin 2,000 ms (to change this default, instead set qualify to the number of milliseconds to wait for the reply).\\nqualifyfreqok and qualifyfreqnotok\\nThese two settings are used to determine how frequently Asterisk should ping a\\npeer when qualify is set. The qualifyfreqok setting determines how often to ping\\nthe peer when it\\'s in an OK state, and qualifyfreqnotok determines how often to\\nping the peer when it\\'s not in an OK state.\\nqualifysmoothing\\nYou can set qualifysmoothing to yes or no. If enabled, Asterisk will take the average\\nof the last two qualify times. This helps eliminate having peers marked as LAGGED,\\n\\nespecially on a lossy network.\\nsendani\\n\\nThe SS7 PSTN network uses Automatic Number Identification (ANI) to identify a\\ncaller, and Caller ID is what is delivered to the user. The Caller ID is generated\\nfrom the ANI, so it\\'s easy to confuse the two. Blocking Caller ID sets a privacy flag\\non the ANI, but the backbone network still knows where the call is coming from:\\nsendani=yes\\n\\nANI has been around for a while. Its original purpose was to deliver\\nthe billing number of the originating party on a long-distance call\\nto the terminating office. Unlike Caller ID, ANI does not require\\nSS7, as it can be transmitted using DTMF. Also, ANI cannot be\\nblocked.\\n\\ntransfer\\n\\nYou can set transfer to yes, no, or mediaonly. If set to yes, Asterisk will transfer the\\ncall away from itself if it can, in order to make the packet path shorter between the\\ntwo endpoints. (This obviously won\\'t work if Asterisk needs to transcode or translate between protocols, or if network conditions don\\'t allow the two endpoints to\\ntalk directly to each other.) If it is set to no, Asterisk will not try to transfer the call\\naway from itself.\\nIf set to mediaonly, Asterisk will attempt to transfer the media stream so that it goes\\ndirectly between the two endpoints, but the call signaling (call setup and teardown\\nmessages) will still go through Asterisk. This is useful because it ensures that call\\ndetail records are still accurate, even though the media is no longer flowing through\\nthe Asterisk box.\\n\\nIAX | 349\\n\\x0cSIP\\nJust as with IAX, the SIP configuration file (sip.conf) contains configuration information\\nfor SIP channels. The headings for the channel definitions are formed by a word framed\\nin square brackets ([])--again, with the exception of the [general] section, where we\\ndefine global SIP parameters. Don\\'t forget to use comments generously in your\\nsip.conf file. Precede the comment text with a semicolon; everything to the right will\\nbe ignored.\\n\\nGeneral SIP Parameters\\nThe following options are to be used within the [general] section of sip.conf:\\nallowexternalinvites\\nIf set to no, this setting disables INVITE and REFER messages to non-local domains. See the domain setting.\\nallowexternalinvites=yes|no\\n\\nallowguest\\n\\nIf set to no, this disallows guest SIP connections. The default is to allow guest\\nconnections. SIP normally requires authentication, but you can accept calls from\\nusers who do not support authentication (i.e., do not have a secret field defined).\\nCertain SIP appliances (such as the Cisco Call Manager v4.1) do not support authentication, so they will not be able to connect if you set allowguest=no:\\nallowguest=no|yes\\n\\nallowoverlap\\nIf set to no, overlap dialing is disabled:\\nallowoverlap=no|yes\\n\\nallowsubscribe\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not to allow external devices to subscribe to extension status\\n(as set in the hint priority). Defaults to yes:\\nallowsubscribe=yes|no\\n\\nallowtransfers\\nIf set to no, transfers are disabled for all SIP calls, unless specifically enabled on a\\n\\nper-user or per-peer basis:\\nallowtransfers=no|yes\\n\\nalwaysauthreject\\n\\nIf this option is enabled, whenever Asterisk rejects an INVITE or REGISTER, it\\nwill always reject it with a 401 Unauthorized message instead of letting the caller\\nknow whether there was a matching user or peer for his request:\\nalwaysauthreject=no|yes\\n\\n350 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cautodomain\\n\\nSet this option to yes to have Asterisk add the local hostname and local IP addresses\\nto the domain list:\\nautodomain=yes|no\\n\\nbindaddr and bindport\\n\\nThese optional parameters allow you to control the IP interface and port on which\\nyou wish to accept SIP connections. If omitted, the port will be set to 5060, and all\\nIP addresses in your Asterisk system will accept incoming SIP connections. If multiple bind addresses are configured, only those interfaces will listen for connections.\\nThe address 0.0.0.0 tells Asterisk to listen on all interfaces:\\n\\nbuggymwi\\n\\nThis setting allows Asterisk to send a message-waiting indication to certain Cisco\\nSIP phones with firmware that doesn\\'t fully support the message-waiting Internet\\nRFC. Enable this option to avoid getting error messages when sending MWI messages on phones with this bug:\\nbuggymwi=no|yes\\n\\ncallevents\\n\\nSet this to yes when you want SIP to generate Manager events. This will be important if you have external programs that use the Asterisk Manager interface, such\\nas the Flash Operator Panel:\\ncallevents=yes\\n\\ncheckmwi\\n\\nThis option specifies the default amount of time, in seconds, between mailbox\\nchecks for peers:\\n\\ncompactheaders\\n\\nYou can set compactheaders to yes or no. If it\\'s set to yes, the SIP headers will use\\na compact format, which may be required if the size of the SIP header is larger than\\nthe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of your IP headers, causing the IP packet\\nto be fragmented. Do not use this option unless you know what you are doing:\\ncompactheaders=yes|no\\n\\ndefaultexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the default SIP registration expiration time, in seconds, for incoming and\\noutgoing registrations. A client will normally define this value when it initially\\nregisters, so the default value you set here will be used only if the client does not\\nspecify a timeout when it registers. If you are registering to another user agent server\\n(UAS), this is the registration timeout that it will send to the far end:\\nSIP | 351\\n\\x0c\\ndirectrtpsetup\\n\\nThis setting configures the direct RTP setup between two endpoints without the\\nneed for RE-INVITEs.\\ndirectrtpsetup=yes|no\\n\\nAs of the time that this book was written, directrtpsetup was still\\nconsidered experimental, and as such should not be enabled unless\\nyou fully understand the consequences. This option will not work\\nfor video calls and cases where the called party sends RTP payloads\\nand FMTP headers in the 200 OK response that do not match the\\ncaller\\'s INVITE request.\\n\\ndomain\\n\\nSets the default domain for this Asterisk server. If configured, Asterisk will allow\\nINVITE and REFER messages only to nonlocal domains. You can use the CLI command sip show domains to list the local domains:\\ndomain=example.com\\n\\ndumphistory\\n\\nYou can set dumphistory to yes or no to enable or disable the printing of the SIP\\nhistory report at the end of the SIP dialog. The SIP history is printed to the DEBUG\\nlogging channel:\\ndumphistory=yes|no\\n\\nexternhost\\nexternhost takes a fully qualified domain name as its argument. If Asterisk is behind\\n\\nNAT, the SIP header will normally use the private IP address assigned to the server.\\nIf you set this option, Asterisk will perform periodic DNS lookups on the hostname\\nand replace the private IP address with the IP address returned from the DNS\\nlookup:\\nexternhost=my.hostname.tld\\n\\nThe use of externhost is not recommended in production systems,\\nbecause if the IP address of the server changes, the wrong IP address\\nwill be set in the SIP headers until the next lookup is performed.\\nThe use of externip is recommended instead.\\n\\nexternip\\nexternip takes an IP address as its argument. If Asterisk is behind NAT, the SIP\\n\\nheader will normally use the private IP address assigned to the server. The remote\\nserver will not know how to route back to this address; thus, it must be replaced\\nwith a valid, routeable address:\\n\\n352 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0c\\nexternrefresh\\nIf externhost is used, externrefresh configures how long, in seconds, should pass\\n\\nbetween DNS lookups:\\n\\n\\nThis parameter can be set when dealing with peers that incorrectly use the wrong\\nencoding for the G.726 codec. This setting tells Asterisk to use AAL2 packing order\\ninstead of RFC3551 packing order if the peer negotiates G726-32 audio. Ordinarily, that would be contrary to the RFC3551 specification, as the peer should be\\nnegotiating AAL2-G726-32 instead. You may need to set this option if you\\'re using\\na Sipura or Grandstream device:\\n\\nignoreregexpire (global)\\nIf ignoreregexpire is set to yes, Asterisk could do one of two things, for:\\n\\nNon-realtime peers\\nWhen their registration expires, the information will not be removed from\\nmemory or the Asterisk database. If you attempt to place a call to the peer, the\\nexisting information will be used in spite of it having expired.\\nRealtime peers\\nWhen the peer is retrieved from realtime storage, the registration information\\nwill be used regardless of whether it has expired or not; if it expires while the\\nrealtime peer is still in memory (due to caching or other reasons), the information will not be removed from realtime storage:\\nignoreregexpire=yes|no\\n\\njbenable\\n\\nEnables the use of an RTP jitter buffer on the receiving side of a SIP channel. Defaults to no. An enabled jitter buffer will be used only if the sending side can create\\nand the receiving side cannot accept jitter. The SIP channel can accept jitter; thus\\na jitter buffer on the receiving side will be used only if it is forced and enabled:\\njbenable=yes|no\\n\\njbforce\\n\\nForces the use of the RTP jitter buffer on the receiving side of a SIP channel. Defaults\\nto no:\\njbforce=yes|no\\n\\njbimpl\\n\\nThis setting is used to specify which jitter buffer implementation to use, the\\nfixed jitter buffer or the adaptive jitter buffer. If the fixed jitter buffer is used, it\\nwill always be the size defined by jbmaxsize. If the adaptive jitter buffer is specified,\\nSIP | 353\\n\\x0cthen the jitter buffer will vary in size up to the maximum size specified by jbmax\\nsize. This setting defaults to fixed:\\njbimpl=fixed|adaptive\\n\\njblog\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not to enable jitter buffer frame logging. Defaults to no:\\njblog=yes|no\\n\\njbmaxsize\\n\\nSets the maximum length of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds:\\n\\njbresyncthreshold\\n\\nJump in the frame timestamps over which the jitter buffer is resynchronized. This\\nis useful to improve the quality of the voice, with big jumps in/broken timestamps\\nthat are usually sent from exotic devices and programs. Defaults to 1000:\\n\\nlimitonpeers\\n\\nThis setting tells Asterisk to apply call limits to peers only. This will improve call\\nlimits and status notification for devices set to type=friend because the peer limit\\nwill be checked, and not create a separate limit for the user and peer portions of a\\nfriend:\\nlimitonpeers=yes|no\\n\\nlocalnet\\nlocalnet is used to tell Asterisk which IP addresses are considered local, so that\\nthe address in the SIP header can be translated to that specified by externip or the\\nIP address can be looked up with externhost. The IP addresses should be specified\\n\\nin CIDR notation:\\n\\nmatchexterniplocally\\n\\nSpecifies that Asterisk should substitute the externip or externhost setting only if\\nit matches your localnet setting. Unless you have some sort of strange network\\nsetup you will not need to enable this:\\nmatchexterniplocally=yes|no\\n\\nmaxexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the maximum amount of time, in seconds, until a peer\\'s registration\\nexpires:\\n\\n354 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cminexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the minimum amount of time, in seconds, allowed for a registration or\\nsubscription:\\n\\nnotifymimetype\\n\\nThis takes as its argument a string specifying the MIME type used for the messagewaiting indication (MWI) in the SIP NOTIFY message. The most common setting\\nfor this field is text/plain, although it can be customized if need be:\\nnotifymimetype=text/plain\\n\\nnotifyringing\\n\\nSpecifies whether Asterisk should notify subscriptions on RINGING state:\\nnotifyringing=yes|no\\n\\nnotifyhold\\n\\nSpecifies whether Asterisk should notify subscriptions on HOLD state:\\nnotifyhold=yes|no\\n\\npedantic\\n\\nYou can set pedantic to yes or no. Setting it to yes enables slow pedantic checking\\nfor phones that require it, such as the Pingtel, and enables more strict SIP RFC\\ncompliancy. In an effort to improve performance, SIP RFC compliance is not normally strictly adhered to:\\npedantic=yes\\n\\nrealm\\n\\nThis option sets the realm for digest authentication. Set realm to your fully qualified\\ndomain name, which must be globally unique:\\nrealm=mybox.example.com\\n\\nrecordhistory\\n\\nYou can set recordhistory to yes or no to enable or disable SIP history recording\\nfor all channels:\\nrecordhistory=yes|no\\n\\nregisterattempts\\n\\nSpecifies how many times Asterisk will attempt its outbound registrations before\\ngiving up. This setting defaults to 0, which means that Asterisk will retry\\nindefinitely:\\n\\nregistertimeout\\n\\nSpecifies how often Asterisk should attempt to re-register to other devices:\\n\\nSIP | 355\\n\\x0crelaxdtmf\\n\\nYou can set relaxdtmf to yes or no. Setting it to yes will relax the DTMF detection\\nhandling. Use this if Asterisk is having a difficult time determining the DTMF on\\nthe SIP channel. Note that this may cause \"talkoff,\" where Asterisk incorrectly\\ndetects DTMF when it should not:\\nrelaxdtmf=yes|no\\n\\nrtautoclear (global)\\n\\nThis specifies whether or not Asterisk should auto-expire friends created on the fly\\non the same schedule as if they had just registered. If set to yes, when the registration expires, the friend will vanish from the configuration until requested again. If\\nset to an integer, friends expire within that number of seconds instead of the normal\\nregistration interval:\\nrtautoclear=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nrtcachefriends (global)\\nIf rtcachefriends is turned on, Asterisk will cache friends that come from the\\n\\nrealtime engine, just as if they had come from sip.conf. This often helps with items\\nsuch as message-waiting indications on realtime peers:\\nrtcachefriends=yes|no\\n\\nrtsavesysname (global)\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should save the systemname in the realtime\\ndatabase at the time of registration:\\nrtsavesysname=yes|no\\n\\nrtupdate (global)\\nIf set to yes Asterisk will update the IP address, origination port, and registration\\nperiod of a peer upon registration.

This allows calls to be forwarded to different locations without the\\nneed to change the logical address. By using SRV records, you gain many of the\\n\\n356 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cadvantages of DNS, whereas disabling them removes the ability to place SIP calls\\nbased on domain names.\\nCurrently, the support for SRV records in Asterisk is somewhat\\nlacking. If multiple SRV records are returned, Asterisk will use only\\nthe first record.\\n\\nUsing DNS SRV record lookups is highly recommended. To enable them, set\\nsrvlookup=yes in the [general] section of sip.conf:\\nsrvlookup=yes\\n\\n\\nThis is the minimum round-trip time for messages to monitored hosts in\\nmilliseconds. Defaults to 100 milliseconds:\\n\\nsubscribecontext\\n\\nLimits SUBSCRIBE requests to the specified context. This is useful if you want to\\nlimit subscriptions to internal extensions, for example.\\nThis option may also be set on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nsubscribecontext=internal\\n\\nSetting t38pt_udptl to yes enables T.38 fax (UDPTL) passthrough on SIP-to-SIP\\n\\ncalls, provided both parties have T.38 support. This setting must be enabled in the\\ngeneral section for all devices to work. You can then disable it on a per-device basis:\\n\\nT.38 fax passthrough works only in SIP-to-SIP calls, without any\\nlocal or agent channel being used. Asterisk cannot currently originate or terminate T.38 fax calls; it can only passthrough UDPTL\\nfrom one device to another.\\n\\ntos_sip, tos_audio, and tos_video\\n\\nAsterisk can set the TOS bits in the IP header to help improve performance on\\nrouters that respect TOS bits in their routing calculations. The tos_sip,\\ntos_audio, and tos_video settings control the TOS bits for the SIP messages, the\\nAF11, AF12, AF13, AF21, AF22, AF23, AF31, AF32, AF33, AF41, AF42, AF43, and ef (expedited forwarding).

If defined, this account code\\nwill be assigned to a call record whenever no specific user account code is set. The\\naccountcode name configured will be used as the <filename>.csv in\\nthe /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/ directory to store CDRs for the user/peer/friend:\\naccountcode=iax-username\\n\\nallow and disallow (both)\\n\\nSpecific codecs can be allowed or disallowed, limiting codec use to those preferred\\nby the system designer. allow and disallow can also be defined on a per-channel\\nbasis. Keep in mind that allow statements in the [general] section will carry over\\nto each of the channels, unless you reset with a disallow=all. Codec negotiation\\n358 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cis attempted in the order in which the codecs are defined. Best practice suggests\\nthat you define disallow=all, followed by explicit allow statements for each codec\\nyou wish to use. If nothing is defined, allow=all is assumed:\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ilbc\\n\\namaflags (both)\\n\\nAutomatic Message Accounting (AMA) is defined in the Telcordia Family of Documents listed under FR-AMA-1. These documents specify standard mechanisms for\\ngeneration and transmission of CDRs. You can specify one of four AMA flags\\n(default, omit, billing, or documentation) to apply to all SIP connections:\\namaflags=documentation\\n\\ncallerid (both)\\n\\nYou can set a suggested Caller ID string for a user or peer with callerid. If you\\ndefine a Caller ID field for a user, any calls that come in on that channel will have\\nthat Caller ID assigned to them, regardless of what the far end sends to you. If\\nCaller ID is defined for a peer, you are requesting that the far end use that to identify\\nyou (keep in mind, however, that you have no way to ensure that it will do so). If\\nyou want incoming callers to be able to define their own Caller IDs (i.e., for guests),\\nmake sure you do not set the callerid field:\\n\\ncallgroup and pickupgroup (both)\\nYou can use the callgroup parameter to assign a channel definition to one or more\\ngroups, and you can use the pickupgroup option in conjunction with this parameter\\n\\nto allow a ringing phone to be answered from another extension. The\\npickupgroup option is used to control which callgroups a channel may pick up--a\\nchannel is given authority to answer another ringing channel if it is assigned to the\\nsame pickupgroup as the ringing channel\\'s callgroup. By default, remote ringing\\nextensions can be answered with *8 (this is configurable in the features.conf file):\\n\\ncallingpres (both)\\n\\nSets Caller ID presentation for this user/peer. This setting takes one of the following\\noptions:\\nallowed_not_screened\\n\\nPresentation allowed, not screened\\nallowed_passed_screen\\n\\nPresentation allowed, passed screen\\n\\nSIP | 359\\n\\x0callowed_failed_screen\\n\\nPresentation allowed, failed screen\\nallowed\\n\\nPresentation allowed, network number\\nprohib_not_screened\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, not screened\\nprohib_passed_screen\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, passed screen\\nprohib_failed_screen\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, failed screen\\nprohib\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, network number\\nunavailable\\n\\nNumber unavailable\\n=yes|no\\n\\ncanreinvite (both)\\n\\nThe SIP protocol tries to connect endpoints directly. However, Asterisk must remain in the transmission path between the endpoints if it is required to detect\\nDTMF (for more information, see Chapter 4):\\ncanreinvite=no\\n\\ncontext (both)\\n\\nA context is assigned to a channel definition to direct incoming calls into the\\nmatching context in extensions.conf, where call handling is performed (see Chapters Chapter 4 and Chapter 5). Any channel connecting to an Asterisk machine has\\nto have a context defined into which it will arrive. The context is essential for any\\nuser channel definition; if you do not define a context, incoming calls will be directed to the default context:\\ncontext=incoming\\n\\nYou should be aware of an unusual scenario that will require a\\ncontext definition for a peer. When a call comes through the SIP\\nchannel, it first tries to find a matching user definition (based on\\nthe user name in square brackets and the secret). If it can\\'t find any\\nmatching users, it then looks for matching peers, based on the IP\\naddress that the call is coming from. Since peers don\\'t normally\\nhave contexts, this will cause such a call to arrive in the default\\ncontext. While this will work, the default context shouldn\\'t really\\nbe used to handle incoming calls. The solution is to define a context, on a per-peer basis, for any peers that might match on\\nincoming calls. To experiment with this, you can call your Free\\nWorld Dialup number; the call will come right back to you.\\n\\n360 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cdefaultip (peer)\\nThe defaultip setting complements host=dynamic. If a host has not yet registered\\n\\nwith your server, you\\'ll attempt to send messages to the default IP address configured here:\\n\\ndeny (both)\\n\\nSpecific IP addresses and ranges can be controlled with the deny option. To restrict\\naccess from a range of IP addresses, use a subnet mask--for example,\\ndeny=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0. You can also deny all addresses with\\ndeny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and then allow only certain addresses with the permit command. Be aware of the security implications of this setting (see also permit):\\n\\ndisallow (both)\\nSee allow.\\ndtmfmode (both)\\n\\nYou can set dtmfmode to inband, rfc2833, or info. DTMF digits can be sent either\\nin band (as part of the audio stream), or out of band (as signaling information),\\nusing the RFC 2833 or INFO methods. The inband method works reliably only\\nwhen using an uncompressed codec such as G.711, law, or alaw. The recommended method is to use rfc2833; however, some devices--such as those by\\nGrandstream--support the info method:\\n\\nIn Asterisk 1.4, Variable Length DTMF was introduced in order to\\nallow Asterisk to correctly signal to the far end the duration of a\\nkey press on the phone connected to the incoming channel (per\\nIETF RFC 2833). Older Asterisk systems do not understand the\\nvariable-length parameter. In older Asterisk systems, DTMF delivered via RFC 2833 may not be correctly interpreted, leading to\\nstrange effects in sessions such as voicemail. If you want to have\\nthe older (pre-1.4) behaviour of the rfc2833 setting, you must add\\nthe rfc2833compensate=yes option to the peer in sip.conf that defines communication with your pre-1.4 Asterisk system.\\n\\nfromdomain (peer)\\n\\nThis allows you to set the domain in the From: field of the SIP header. It may be\\nrequired by some providers for authentication:\\nfromdomain=my.hostname.tld\\n\\nfromuser (peer)\\n\\nThis allows you to set the username with which to authenticate. The name contained within the square brackets of the channel definition is usually used, but this\\nSIP | 361\\n\\x0ccan be overridden with the fromuser option. This allows a channel definition to be\\nreferenced with a name other than that used to authenticate:\\nfromuser=john_smith\\n\\nhost (peer)\\n\\nThis configures the host to which this peer is to connect. Use a fully qualified\\ndomain name:\\nhost=remote.hostname.tld\\n\\nincominglimit (both)\\n\\nThis option limits the total number of simultaneous calls for a peer or user. It sets\\nthe max number of simultaneous outgoing calls for a peer, or the max number of\\nincoming calls for a user.\\n\\ninsecure (both)\\nWhen an INVITE is received from a remote location, Asterisk attempts to authenticate the string of characters before the @ sign on the INVITE line received in the\\n\\nSIP header with the name of a channel definition in sip.conf. If the remote end is a\\nuser agent, it will authenticate based on a user definition. However, if the remote\\nend is a SIP proxy service, it will authenticate on the peer entry. When calls come\\nfrom a provider such as Free World Dialup, which acts as a proxy for the true\\nremote end who is calling you, that provider cannot authenticate the call on behalf\\nof the endpoint. Since it would be impractical to have an authentication configured\\nfor every FWD user, and since FWD cannot respond to a 407 Proxy Authentication\\nRequired response, there must be an alternate way to allow calls from these callers.\\nIf you set insecure=invite, you\\'ll determine which peer to match on by comparing\\nthe IP address or hostname and port number to those provided in the Contact field\\nof the SIP header with the host and port options in sip.conf. If a match is found,\\nauthentication will not be required on the initial INVITE, and the call will be allowed.\\nIf you have multiple endpoints behind a NAT device, you need to enable inse\\ncure=port to match against only the IP address. To not require authentication on\\nthe incoming INVITE for the peer, set insecure=invite,port:\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nlanguage (both)\\n\\nThis sets the language flag to whatever you define. The global default language is\\nEnglish. The language that is set is sent by the channel as an information element.\\nIt is also used by applications such as SayNumber() that have different files for different languages. Keep in mind that languages other than English are not explicitly\\ninstalled on the system, and it is up to you to configure the system to ensure that\\nthe language you specify is handled properly:\\n\\n362 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0clanguage=en\\n\\nmailbox (peer)\\n\\nIf you associate a mailbox with a peer within the channel definition, voicemail will\\nsend a MWI to the nodes on the end of that channel. If the mailbox number is in\\na voicemail context other than default, you can specify it as mailbox @ context. To\\nassociate multiple mailboxes with a single peer, use multiple mailbox statements:\\n\\nmaxcallbitrate (both)\\n\\nSets the maximum bitrate for an individual call from this user or to this peer. Defaults to 384 Kb/s:\\n\\n\\nIf you do not wish to have plain-text secrets in your sip.conf files, you can use\\nmd5secret to configure the MD5 hash that can be used for authentication. To gen-\\n\\nerate the MD5 hash from the Linux console, use the following command:\\n# echo -n \"username:realm:secret\" | md5sum\\n\\nBe sure to use the -n flag, or echo will add a \\\\n to the end of the string; the line feed\\nwill then be calculated into the MD5 hash, creating the incorrect hash. The\\nrealm, if not specified with the realm option (discussed in the list of general SIP\\nparameters), defaults to asterisk. If both an md5secret and a secret are specified\\nin the same channel definition, the secret will be ignored:\\n\\nmohinterpret (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies a preference for which MoH class this channel should listen\\nto when put on hold if the music class has not been set on the channel with Set\\n(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan, and the peer channel putting this\\none on hold did not suggest a music class.\\nThis option may be specified globally, or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohinterpret=default\\n\\nmohsuggest (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies which music-on-hold class (as defined in musiconhold.conf)\\nto suggest to the peer channel when this channel places the peer on hold. It may\\nbe specified globally or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohsuggest=default\\n\\nmusicclass (both)\\n\\nThis option sets the default music-on-hold class:\\nmusicclass=classical\\n\\nSIP | 363\\n\\x0cnat (both)\\n\\nYou can set nat to yes, no, or never. If you set it to yes, Asterisk ignores the IP\\naddress in the SIP and SDP headers and responds to the address and port in the IP\\nheader. The never option is for devices that cannot handle rport in the SIP header,\\nsuch as the Uniden UIP200:\\nnat=yes|no|never\\n\\npermit (both)\\nSee deny.\\npickupgroup (both)\\nSee callgroup.\\nport (peer)\\n\\nYou can use this to define the port on which to listen for SIP signaling, if you want\\nto listen on a nonstandard port. (The default port for SIP signaling is 5060.)\\n\\nprogressinband (both)\\nYou can set progressinband to yes, no, or never, to configure whether or not to\\n\\ngenerate in-band ringing. Normally, Asterisk will send the progress of a call via a\\nfew methods, such as 183 Session Progress, 180 Ringing, 486 Busy, and so on. If\\nyou set progressinband=yes, Asterisk will indicate the call progress in band by generating tones:\\nprogressinband=yes|no|never\\n\\npromiscredir (both)\\nYou can set promiscredir to yes or no. Normally, when you perform call forwarding\\non a phone, Asterisk will use the Local channel (for example, local/\\n18005551212@peer). If you set promiscredir=yes, Asterisk will use the SIP channel\\n\\ninstead, which enables you to forward the calls to remote boxes:\\npromiscredir=yes|no\\n\\nNote that if Asterisk performs a redirect to itself when promiscre\\ndir=yes, the system will receive an INVITE with the same Caller ID\\nand detect a loop to itself. SIP does not have the ability to perform\\na hairpin call, so the channel will then be destroyed.\\n\\nqualify (peer)\\n\\nYou can set qualify to yes, no, or a time in milliseconds. If you set qualify=yes,\\nNOTIFY messages will be sent periodically to the remote peers to determine whether\\nthey are available and what the latency between replies is. A peer is determined\\nunreachable if no reply is received within 2,000 ms (to change this default, instead\\nset qualify to the number of milliseconds to wait for the reply). Use this option in\\nconjunction with nat=yes to keep the path through the NAT device alive:\\n\\n364 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cqualify=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nregcontext (peer)\\n\\nBy specifying the context that contains the actions to perform, you can configure\\nAsterisk to perform a number of actions when a peer registers to your server. This\\noption works in conjunction with regexten by specifying the extension to execute.\\nIf no regexten is configured, the peer name is used as the extension. Asterisk will\\ndynamically create and destroy a NoOp at priority 1 for the extension. All actions to\\nbe performed upon registration should start at priority 2. More than one\\nregexten may be supplied, if separated by an &. regcontext can be set on a per-peer\\nbasis or globally:\\nregcontext=peer_registrations\\n\\nregexten (peer)\\nThe regexten option is used in conjunction with regcontext to specify the extension\\nthat is executed within the configured context. If regexten is not explicitly config-\\n\\nured, the peer name is used as the extension to match:\\n\\nrtpholdtimeout (peer)\\n\\nThis takes as its argument an integer, specified in seconds. It terminates a call if no\\nRTP data is received while on hold within the time specified. The value of rtphold\\ntimeout must be greater than that of rtptimeout (see also rtptimeout):\\n\\nrtpkeepalive (peer)\\n\\nSpecifies how often Asterisk should send keepalives in the RTP stream, in seconds.\\nDefaults to zero, which means Asterisk won\\'t send any RTP keepalives:\\n\\nrtptimeout (peer)\\n\\nThis takes as its argument an integer, specified in seconds. It terminates a call if no\\nRTP data is received within the time specified:\\n\\nsecret (both)\\n\\nThis sets the password to use for authentication:\\nsecret=welcome\\n\\nsetvar (both)\\n\\nThis sets a channel variable, which will be available when a channel to the peer or\\nuser is created and will be destroyed when the call is hung up. For example, to set\\nthe channel variable foo with a value of bar, use:\\nsetvar=foo=bar\\n\\nSIP | 365\\n\\x0cusername (peer)\\nThe username field allows you to attempt contact with a peer before it has registered\\n\\nwith you. At registration, a SIP device tells Asterisk which SIP URI to use to contact\\nit. The username is used in conjunction with defaultip to create the SIP URI in the\\nSIP INVITE header. This might be useful following a reboot, in order to place a call.\\nThe endpoints will not attempt to register with the server until their registration\\ntimeouts expire, so you will not know their locations. For nondynamic hosts, you\\nwill require the username to be specified, as it is used to construct the authorization username:\\nusername=john_smith\\n\\n366 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX B\\n\\nApplication Reference\\n\\nApplications are the core functionality of the dialplan. Generally these all will operate\\non the channel, whereas functions, described in Appendix F, merely return values that\\ncan be used by applications. There are a few applications that still simply return values,\\nbut these will probably be deprecated in a future version and replaced with dialplan\\nfunctions.\\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about applications. First, when they exit, they\\nwill either terminate normally or abnormally. Abnormal termination almost always\\noccurs when an application detects that the channel has hung up (or if it doesn\\'t, the\\ndialplan will detect that shortly thereafter). An application may also exit abnormally\\nwhen it wishes to indicate to the dialplan that some condition has not been satisfied\\nand that it should force a hangup. In all other cases, an application will exit normally,\\nwhich indicates that processing should continue at the next priority in the dialplan.\\nIn many cases, if you wish to override the application\\'s wish to cause a hangup, you\\nmay wrap the application in a TryExec().\\nIn many places throughout this reference, you will see what\\'s described as a label. This\\nis shorthand for describing a location in the dialplan, whether it is simply a priority;\\nan extension and a priority; or a context, an extension, and a priority. Note that if a\\ntext label is defined for a particular priority, the priority may be replaced with that\\ntext label in any of those cases. See the GotoIf() application for more information\\nand an example.\\nYou will find many of the examples in this appendix to contain numbered priorities, which is not the preferred method of writing dialplans.\\nWe prefer the use of the \\'n\\' priority for all priority numbers except 1\\n(which is required), but we have decided to utilize them in order to make\\nsome of the examples more clear.\\n\\nAddQueueMember()\\n\\nDynamically adds queue members to the specified call queue\\n\\nAddQueueMember(queuename[,interface[,penalty,[option,[membername]]]])\\n\\n\\x0cDynamically adds the specified interface to an existing queue named queuename, as\\nspecified in queues.conf. If specified, penalty sets the penalty for queues to use this\\nmember. Members with a lower penalty are called before members with a higher\\npenalty.\\nThe AddQueueMember() application sets a channel variable named AQMSTATUS upon completion. The AQMSTATUS variable will be set to one of the following values:\\nADDED\\nMEMBERALREADY\\nNOSUCHQUEUE\\n\\nCalling AddQueueMember() without an interface argument will use the interface that the\\ncaller is currently using.\\nIf the option argument is set to j, Asterisk cannot add the interface to the specified\\nqueue, and there exists an n+101 priority (where n is the number of the current priority),\\nthe call will jump to that priority.\\nThe membername argument may be set to the name of the queue member. Consequently,\\nthis name will show up in the entries of the queue_log as well as Asterisk Manager\\nInterface events, making it easier to identify the agent for reporting purposes:\\n; add SIP/3000 to the techsupport queue, with a penalty of 1\\nexten => 123,1,AddQueueMember(techsupport,SIP/3000,1)\\n\\nSee Also\\nQueue(), RemoveQueueMember(), PauseQueueMember(), UnpauseQueueMember(), AgentLogin\\n() , queues.conf\\n\\nADSIProg()\\n\\nLoads an ADSI script into an ADSI-capable phone\\n\\nADSIProg(script)\\n\\nPrograms an Analog Display Services Interface (ADSI) phone with the given script.

As such, it should be used only in conjunction with (and after!) the AgentCallbackLogin() application. It uses the monitoring\\nfunctions in the chan_agent module instead of the Monitor() application to record the\\ncalls. This means that call recording must be configured correctly in the agents.conf file.\\nBy default, recorded calls are saved to the /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/ directory.

By allowing a single Dial() command to\\nconnect to multiple Local channels, one Dial() event can trigger a multitude of completely independent and\\nunique actions in other parts of the dialplan.

The extension is not required by Dial(), as the information in the\\nremote end\\'s channel configuration file may be used, or the remote server will pass the\\ncall to the s extension in the context in which the call came in. Ultimately, the far end\\ncontrols what happens to the call; you can only request a specific treatment.\\nIf no ring-timeout is specified, the channel will ring indefinitely.

This application is often used\\nas a debugging tool. Whenever Asterisk\\'s core verbosity level is set to 3 or above, Asterisk evaluates and prints each line of the dialplan before executing it.

If quotes are placed\\nwithin the brackets, they will show up on the console.\\n\\nWhen to use NoOp() and Verbose()\\nThe difference between Verbose() and NoOp() is subtle. Here are some suggestions as\\nto how you can discern when to use each. The Verbose() application is handy when\\nyou want to output something to the console. Using the set verbose command (followed by the level of verbosity you desire--0 to 4), you can set the output to a level\\nthat will not show you all of the activity on the system, but rather only those things\\nthat are equal to or less than that the current level. (Actually, you can set the verbosity\\nto whatever you want. The set verbose 999 will work just fine, but we have not been\\nable to find anything that outputs at a level higher than 4, so anything from 4 to infinity\\nwill be effectively the same for the time being.) This means that you can display all\\n\\nNoCDR() | 415\\n\\x0ckinds of information pertaining to a section of code you are testing, without having to\\nsee all of the other activity in the system. If you set the following in your dial plan:\\nexten => _X.,n,Verbose(2, ${SOME_VAR})\\n\\nYou can then use the CLI to set the verbosity to 2 or less (core set verbose 2), and you\\nwill see output from the various calls to Verbose(), but very little else.\\nRead the section on Verbose() later in this appendix for more on how to use it. The\\nNoOp() application is best used as a place holder. For example, if you are setting a\\nGoto() point in your dialplan that is using a priority label, you can use NoOp() as the\\ndestination point for that goto. For example,\\nexten => _X.,n(call_forward),NoOp()\\n\\nis an excellent marker for pointing a jump in your dialplan to a spot. From that point\\nyou can carry on with whatever logic you wanted to apply to that part of the extension\\n(judging by the label, it\\'d have something to do with call forwarding). The value of the\\nNoOp() is that when you don\\'t really know what sort of things you might want to move\\naround in relation to what follows that label, you can be sure you\\'ll never have to recode\\nthe label itself. It will never do anything other than provide a destination for the\\nGoto(), so you can put it wherever you like and be sure it won\\'t introduce any unexpected behavior.\\nIf this seems confusing, it is due to our inability to describe it right. Experiment with\\nVerbose() and NoOp() all in your dialplan (you can use them anywhere), and you will\\nquickly gain an understanding of how they can help you (especially if you are like us\\nand cause a lot of syntax errors).\\n\\nSee Also\\nVerbose(), Log()\\n\\nPage()\\n\\nOpens one-way audio to multiple phones\\n\\n\\nPlaces outbound calls to the given technology/resource and dumps them in to a conference bridge as muted participants.

This will not provide you with a working system, but it clearly demonstrates the modularity of the platform.\\nIf no .conf files are found, Asterisk will make some decisions with respect to modules.\\nFor example, the following steps are always taken:\\n The Asterisk Event Logger is loaded, and events are logged\\nto /var/log/asterisk/event_log.\\n Manager actions are registered.\\n The PBX core is initialized.\\n The RTP port range is allocated from 5,000 through 31,000.\\n Several built-in applications are loaded, such as Answer(), Background(), GotoIf(),\\nNoOp(), and Set().\\n The dynamic loader is started; this is the engine responsible for loading modules\\ndefined in modules.conf.\\nThis appendix starts with an in-depth look at the modules.conf configuration file. We\\'ll\\nthen briefly examine all the other files that you may need to configure for your Asterisk\\nsystem.\\n\\n\\x0cmodules.conf\\nThe modules.conf file controls which modules are loaded or not loaded at Asterisk\\nstartup. This is done through the use of the load => or noload => constructs.\\nThis file is a key component to building a secure Asterisk installation:\\nbest practice suggests that only required modules be loaded.\\n\\nThe modules.conf file always starts with the [modules] header. The autoload statement\\ntells Asterisk whether to automatically load all modules contained within the modules\\ndirectory or to load only those modules specifically defined by load => statements. We\\nrecommend you manually load only those modules you need, but many people find it\\neasier to let Asterisk attempt to autoload whatever it finds in /usr/lib/asterisk/modules.\\nYou can then exclude* certain modules with noload => statements.\\nHere\\'s a sample modules.conf file:\\n[modules]\\nautoload=no\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nres_adsi.so\\npbx_config.so\\nchan_sip.so\\ncodec_alaw.so\\ncodec_gsm.so\\ncodec_ulaw.so\\nformat_gsm.so\\napp_dial.so\\n\\n; set this to yes and Asterisk will load any\\n; modules it finds in /usr/lib/asterisk/modules\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\n\\nN/A\\nres_crypto.so, res_features.so\\nres_features.so\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nres_features.so, res_musiconhold.so\\n\\nSince we assume Asterisk is built on Linux, all the module names we use end in a .so\\nextension. However, this may not be the case if you have built Asterisk on a different\\noperating system.\\nAs of this writing, there are eight module types: resources, applications,\\nCall Detail Record database connectors, channels, codecs, formats, PBX modules, and\\nstandalone functions. Let\\'s take a look at each of them.\\n\\nadsi.conf\\nThe Analog Display Services Interface (ADSI) was designed to allow telephone companies to deliver enhanced services across analog telephone circuits. In Asterisk, you\\n* With the advent of the new menuselect system, this best practice may no longer be necessary if you are\\n\\nbuilding only the modules you need in the first place\\n\\n462 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ccan use this file to send ADSI commands to compatible telephones. Please note that\\nthe phone must be directly connected to a Zapata channel. ADSI messages cannot be\\nsent across a VoIP connection to a remote analog phone.\\nThe res_adsi.so module is required for the Voicemail() application; however, the\\nadsi.conf file is not necessarily used. Detailed information about ADSI is not publicly\\navailable, and documentation needs to be purchased from Telcordia.\\n\\nadtranvofr.conf\\nPrior to Voice over IP, Voice over Frame Relay (VoFR) enjoyed brief fame as a means\\nof carrying packetized voice. Supporting VoFR through Adtran equipment is part of\\nthe history of Asterisk.\\nThis feature is no longer popular in the community, though, so it may be difficult to\\nfind support for it.\\n\\nagents.conf\\nThis file allows you to create and manage agents for your call center. If you are using\\nthe Queue() application, you may want to configure agents for the queue. The\\nagents.conf file is used to configure the AGENT channel driver.\\nThe [general] section in agents.conf currently contains only two parameters. The\\npersistentagents parameter tells Asterisk whether or not to save the status of agents\\nwho use the callback feature of queues in the local Asterisk database. If set to yes, a\\nlogged-in remote agent will then remain logged in across a reboot (unless removed from\\nthe database through some other means). The multiplelogin parameter tells Asterisk\\nwhether or not multiple agents can log in from the same extension.\\nThe following parameters, which are specified in the [agents] section, are used to define\\nagents and the way the system interacts with them. The settings apply to all agents,\\nunless otherwise specified in the individual agent definitions:\\nmaxlogintries\\n\\nThe maximum number of times an agent may attempt to log in. Defaults to 3.\\nautologoff\\n\\nAccepts an argument (in seconds) defining how long an agent channel should ring\\nfor before the agent is deemed unavailable and logged off.\\nautologoffunavail\\nDefine autologoffunavail to have agents automatically logged out when the Dial\\n() application returns a CHANUNAVAIL status while trying to dial that agent. Default\\n\\nis \"no\".\\n\\nadtranvofr.conf | 463\\n\\x0cackcall\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. If set to yes, requires a callback agent to acknowledge log in by pressing the # key after logging in. This works in conjunction\\nwith the AgentCallbackLogin() application.\\nendcall\\n\\nIf set to yes, allows an agent to hang up a call by pressing the * key. Defaults to\\nyes. Set this to no to have Asterisk do nothing when the agent presses the * key.\\nwrapuptime\\n\\nYou can configure this parameter to allow agents a few seconds of downtime after\\ncompleting a call before the queue presents them with another call. This setting is\\nmeasured in milliseconds.\\nmusiconhold => class\\n\\nAccepts a music-on-hold class as its argument. This setting applies to all agents.\\nagentgoodbye\\n\\nDefines the default goodbye sound for agents.\\nupdatecdr\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Used to define whether the source channel in\\nthe CDRs should be set to agent/agent_id to determine which agent generated the\\ncalls.\\ngroup\\n\\nDefines the groups to which an agent belongs, specified with integers. Specify that\\nan agent belongs to multiple groups by separating the integers with commas.\\nrecordagentcalls\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Defines whether or not agent calls should be\\nrecorded.\\nrecordformat\\n\\nDefines the format to record files in. The argument specified should be wav, gsm,\\nor wav49. The default recording format is wav.\\nurlprefix\\n\\nAccepts a string as its argument. The string can be formed as a URL and is appended\\nto the start of the text to be added to the name of the recording.\\nsavecallsin\\n\\nAccepts a filesystem path as its argument. Allows you to override the default path\\nof /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/ with one of your choosing.\\nSince the storage of calls will require a large amount of hard drive\\nspace, you will want to define a strategy to handle storing and\\nmanaging these recordings.\\nThis location should probably reside on a separate volume, one\\nwith very high performance characteristics.\\n\\n464 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ccustom_beep\\n\\nAccepts a filename as its argument. Can be used to define a custom notification\\ntone to signal to an always-connected agent that there is an incoming call.\\nThe final parameter is used to define agents. Just like in the zapata.conf file, configuration parameters are inherited from above the agent => definition. Agents are defined\\nwith the following format:\\nagent => agent_id,agent_password,name\\n\\nFor example, we can define agent Happy Tempura with the agent ID 1000 and password 1234, as follows.\\nagent => 1000,1234,Happy Tempura\\n\\nBe aware that an agents.conf file is a complement to the queue configuration process.\\nThe most critical configuration file for your queues is queues.conf. You can configure\\na very basic queue without agents.conf.\\n\\nalarmreceiver.conf\\nThe AlarmReceiver() application is not approved by Underwriter\\'s Laboratory (UL) and should not be used as the primary or sole means of\\nreceiving alarm messages or events. This application is not guaranteed\\nto be reliable, so don\\'t depend on it unless you have extensively tested\\nit. Use of this application without extensive testing may place your life\\nand/or property at risk.\\n\\nThe alarmreceiver.conf file is used by the AlarmReceiver() application, which allows\\nAsterisk to accept alarms using the SIA (Ademco) Contact ID protocol. When a call is\\nreceived from an alarm panel, it should be directed to a context that calls the AlarmRe\\nceiver() application. In turn, AlarmReceiver() will read the alarmreceiver.conf configuration file and perform the configured actions as required. All parameters are specified\\nunder the [general] heading.\\nThe sample configuration file will contain the current settings for this application and\\nis very well documented.\\n\\nalsa.conf\\nThe alsa.conf file is used to configure Asterisk to use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) to provide access to a sound card, if desired. You can use this file to\\nconfigure the CONSOLE channel, which is most commonly used to create an overhead\\npaging system (although, as with any other channel, there are all kinds of creative ways\\nthis can be used). Keep in mind that the usefulness of the ALSA channel by itself is\\nlimited due to its lack of a user interface.\\n\\nalarmreceiver.conf | 465\\n\\x0camd.conf\\nThis is the configuration for the answering matching detection application in Asterisk,\\ncalled AMD(). It is used to adjust the different parameters for detecting an answering\\nmachine based on items such as initial silence, greeting length, silence after the greeting,\\nand so forth.\\n\\nasterisk.conf\\nThe asterisk.conf file defines the locations for the configuration files, the spool directory, and the modules, as well as a location to write logfiles to. The default settings are\\nrecommended unless you understand the implications of changing them. The\\nasterisk.conf file is generated automatically when you run the make samples command,\\nbased on information it collects about your system. It will contain a [directories]\\nsection such as the following:\\n[directories]\\nastetcdir => /etc/asterisk\\nastmoddir => /usr/lib/asterisk/modules\\nastvarlibdir => /var/lib/asterisk\\nastdatadir => /var/lib/asterisk\\nastagidir => /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin\\nastspooldir => /var/spool/asterisk\\nastrundir => /var/run\\nastlogdir => /var/log/asterisk\\n\\nAdditionally, you can specify an [options] section, which will allow you to define\\nstartup options (command-line switches) in the configuration file. The following example shows the available options and the command-line switches that they effectively\\nenforce:\\n[options]\\n;Under \"options\" you can enter configuration options\\n;that you also can set with command line options\\nverbose = 0\\ndebug = 3\\nnofork=yes | no\\nalwaysfork=yes | no\\nconsole= yes | no\\nhighpriority = yes | no\\ninitcrypto = yes | no\\nnocolor = yes | no\\ndumpcore = yes | no\\nquiet = yes | no\\ntimestamp = yes | no\\n\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nVerbosity level for logging (-v)\\nDebug: \"No\" or value (1-4)\\nBackground execution disabled (-f)\\nAlways background, even with -v or -d (-F)\\nConsole mode (-c)\\nExecute with high priority (-p)\\nInitialize crypto at startup (-i)\\nDisable ANSI colors (-n)\\nDump core on failure (-g)\\nRun quietly (-q)\\nForce timestamping in CLI verbose output (-T)\\n\\n Yes, we are aware that the user interface to the channel interface is the Asterisk CLI; however, this is not\\n\\nusable as a telephone and therefore does not meet the criteria of an interface from the perspective of a\\ntelephone user.\\n\\n466 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0crunuser = asterisk\\n\\n; User to run asterisk as (-U) NOTE: will require changes to\\n; directory and device permissions\\nrungroup = asterisk\\n; Group to run asterisk as (-G)\\ninternal_timing = yes | no ; Enable internal timing support (-I)\\n; These options have no command line equivalent\\ncache_record_files = yes | no\\n; Cache record() files in another directory until\\n; completion\\nrecord_cache_dir = <dir>\\ntranscode_via_sln = yes | no\\n; Build transcode paths via SLINEAR\\ntransmit_silence_during_record = yes | no ; send SLINEAR silence while channel is\\n; being recorded\\nmaxload = 1.0\\n; The maximum load average we accept calls for\\nmaxcalls = 255\\n; The maximum number of concurrent calls you want\\n; to allow\\nexecincludes = yes | no\\n; Allow #exec entries in configuration files\\ndontwarn = yes | no\\n; Don\\'t over-inform the Asterisk sysadm, he\\'s a guru\\nsystemname = <a_string>\\n; System name. Used to prefix CDR uniqueid and to\\n; fill ${SYSTEMNAME}\\nlanguageprefix = yes | no ; Should language code be last component of sound file\\n; name or first?\\n; When off, sound files are searched as\\n; <path>/<lang>/<file>\\n; When on, sound files are search as <lang>/<path>/<file>\\n; (only affects relative paths for sound files)\\n\\ncdr.conf\\nThe cdr.conf file is used to enable call detail record logging to a flat file or a database.\\nStoring call records is useful for all sorts of purposes including billing, fraud prevention,\\nQoS evaluations, and more. The cdr.conf file contains some general parameters that\\nare not specific to any particular database, but rather indicate how Asterisk should\\nhandle the passing of information to the database. All options are under the\\n[general] heading of the cdr.conf file:\\nenable\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Specifies whether or not to use CDR logging. If\\nset to no, this will override any CDR module explicitly loaded. The default is yes.\\nbatch\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Allows Asterisk to write data to a buffer instead\\nof writing to the database at the end of every call, to reduce load on the system.\\nNote that if the system dies unexpectedly when this option is set\\nto yes, data loss may occur.\\n\\ncdr.conf | 467\\n\\x0csize\\n\\nSets the maximum number of CDRs to accumulate in the buffer before posting to\\nthe backend CDR storage systems. This setting only takes effect if the batch setting\\nis set to yes. This setting defaults to 100 records.\\ntime\\n\\nAccepts an integer (in seconds) as its argument. Sets the number of seconds before\\nAsterisk flushes the buffer and writes the CDRs to the database, regardless of the\\nnumber of records in the buffer (as defined by size). The default is 300 seconds (5\\nminutes).\\nscheduleronly\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. If you are generating a massive volume of CDRs\\non a system that is pushing them to a remote database, setting scheduleronly to\\nyes may be of benefit. Since the scheduler cannot start a new task until the current\\none is finished, slow CDR writes may adversely affect other processes needing the\\nscheduler. This setting will instruct Asterisk to handle CDR writes in a new thread,\\nessentially assigning a dedicated scheduler to this function. In normal operation,\\nthis would yield very little benefit.\\nsafeshutdown\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Setting safeshutdown to yes will prevent Asterisk\\nfrom shutting down completely until the buffer is flushed and all information is\\nwritten to the database. If this parameter is set to no and you shut down Asterisk\\nwith information still residing in the buffers, that information will likely be lost.\\nendbeforehexten\\n\\nNormally, CDR records are not closed out until after all extensions are finished\\nexecuting. By enabling this option, the CDR will be ended before executing the h\\nextension so that CDR values such as end and billsec may be retrieved inside of\\nthis extension. Defaults to no.\\nThe rest of cdr.conf contains setup for several of the backend CDR engines. See the\\nsample cdr.conf for more information.\\n\\ncdr_manager.conf\\nThe cdr_manager.conf file simply contains a [general] heading and a single option,\\nenabled, which you can use to specify whether or not the Asterisk Manager API generates CDR events. If you want CDR events to be generated, you will need the following\\nlines in your cdr_manager.conf file:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\n\\nThe Manager API will then output CDR events containing the following fields:\\nEvent: Cdr\\nAccountCode:\\n\\n468 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cSource:\\nDestination:\\nDestinationContext:\\nCallerID:\\nChannel:\\nDestinationChannel:\\nLastApplication:\\nLastData:\\nStartTime:\\nAnswerTime:\\nEndTime:\\nDuration:\\nBillableSeconds:\\nDisposition:\\nAMAFlags:\\nUniqueID:\\nUserField:\\n\\ncdr_odbc.conf\\nAsterisk can store CDR data in a local or remote database via the ODBC interface. The\\ncdr_odbc.conf file contains the information Asterisk needs to connect to the database.\\nThe cdr_odbc.so module will attempt to load the cdr_odbc.conf file, and if information\\nis found for connecting to a database, the CDR data will be recorded there.\\nIf you are going to use a database for storing CDR data, you will have\\nto select one of the many that are available. Asterisk does not like having\\nmultiple CDR databases to connect to, so do not have extra\\ncdr_engine.conf files hanging about your Asterisk configuration\\ndirectory.\\n\\ncdr_pgsql.conf\\nAsterisk can store CDR data in a PostgreSQL database via the cdr_pgsql.so module.\\nWhen the module is loaded the necessary information will be read from the\\ncdr_pgsql.conf file, and Asterisk will connect to the PostgreSQL database to write and\\nstore CDR data.\\n\\ncdr_tds.conf\\nAsterisk can also store CDR data to a FreeTDS database (including MS SQL) with the\\nuse of the cdr_tds.so module. The configuration file cdr_tds.conf is read once the module\\nis loaded. Upon a successful connection, CDR data will be written to the database.\\n\\ncdr_odbc.conf | 469\\n\\x0ccodecs.conf\\nMost codecs do not have any configurable parameters; they are what they are, and\\nthat\\'s all they are.\\nSome codecs, however, are capable of behaving in different ways. This primarily means\\nthat they can be optimized for a particular goal, such as cutting down on latency, making best use of a network, or perhaps delivering high quality audio.\\nThe codecs.conf file is fairly new in Asterisk, and as of this writing it allows configuration\\nof Speex parameters only. The settings are self-explanatory, as long as you are familiar\\nwith the Speex protocol (see http://www.speex.org).\\ncodecs.conf also allows you to configure Packet Loss Concealment (PLC). You need to\\ndefine a [plc] section and indicate genericplc => true. This will cause Asterisk to\\nattempt to interpolate any packets that are missed. (Enabling this functionality will\\nincur a small performance penalty.)\\n\\ndnsmgr.conf\\nThis file is used to configure whether Asterisk should perform DNS lookups on a regular\\nbasis, and how often those lookups should be performed.\\n\\ndundi.conf\\nThe DUNDi protocol is used to dynamically look up the VoIP address of a phone\\nnumber on a network, and to connect to that address. Unlike the ENUM standard,\\nDUNDi has no central authority. The dundi.conf file contains DUNDi extensions used\\nto control what is advertised; it also contains the peers to whom you will submit lookup\\nrequests and from whom you will accept lookup requests. The DUNDi protocol was\\nexplored in Chapter 14.\\n\\nenum.conf\\nThe Electronic Numbering (ENUM) system is used in conjunction with the Internet\\'s\\nDNS system to map E.164 ITU standard (ordinary telephone) numbers to email addresses, web sites, VoIP addresses, and the like. An ENUM number is created in DNS\\nby reversing the phone number, separating each digit with a period, and appending\\ne164.arpa (the primary DNS zone). If you want Asterisk to perform ENUM lookups,\\nconfigure the domain(s) in which to perform the lookups within the enum.conf file. In\\naddition to the official e164.arpa domain, you can have Asterisk perform lookups in\\nthe publicly accessible e164.org domain.\\n\\n470 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cextconfig.conf\\nAsterisk can write configuration data to and load configuration data from a database\\nusing the external configuration engine (also known as realtime). This enables you to\\nmap external configuration files (static mappings) to a database, allowing the information to be retrieved from the database. It also allows you to map special runtime\\nentries that permit the dynamic creation and loading of objects, entities, peers, and so\\non without a reload. These mappings are assigned and configured in the\\nextconfig.conf file, which is used by both res_odbc and realtime.\\n\\nextensions.conf\\nAt the center of every good universe is a dialplan. The extensions.conf file is the means\\nby which you tell Asterisk how you want calls to be handled. The dialplan contains a\\nlist of instructions that, unlike traditional telephony systems, is entirely customizable.\\nThe dialplan is so important that rather than defining it in this appendix, we have\\ndedicated all of Chapters 5 and 6, as well as Appendix B, to this topic. Go forth, read,\\nand enjoy!\\n\\nextensions.ael\\nThis file is the equivalent of extensions.conf, only it\\'s for dialplans written in the AEL\\nlanguage. When Asterisk loads the dialplan, it reads the AEL dialplan from exten\\nsions.ael and merges it with the dialplan from extensions.conf.\\n\\nfeatures.conf\\nfeatures.conf, the file formally known as parking.conf, contains configuration information related to call parking and call transfers. Call parking configuration options\\ninclude:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe extension to dial to park calls (parkext =>)\\nThe extension range to park calls in (parkpos =>)\\nWhich context to park calls in (context =>)\\nHow long a call can remain parked for before ringing the extension that parked it\\n(parkingtime =>)\\n The sound file played to the parked caller when the call is removed from parking\\n(courtesytone =>)\\n ADSI parking announcements (asdipark=yes|no)\\n\\nextconfig.conf | 471\\n\\x0cIn addition to the call parking options, in this file you can configure the button mappings for blind transfers, attended transfers, one-touch recording, disconnections, and\\nthe pickup extension (which allows you to answer a remotely ringing extension).\\n\\nfestival.conf\\nThe Festival text-to-speech engine allows Asterisk to read text files to the end user with\\na computer-generated voice. Festival is covered in Chapter 14.\\n\\nfollowme.conf\\nThe term findme/follow me is intended to give the impression that a PBX system has\\nthe intelligence to locate a user wherever they may be, such that their calls will find\\nthem and follow them. The followme.conf file is used to configure the FollowMe() dialplan application.\\n\\nfunc_odbc.conf\\nThe func_odbc dialplan function was one of the most anticipated capabilities to have\\nbeen added to Asterisk 1.4. This function provides a simple mechanism with which to\\nconnect to ODBC databases through the dialplan. The SQL queries are defined in this\\nconfiguration file, and a dialplan function is automatically created.\\n\\ngtalk.conf\\nThis configuration file is used to specify the parameters for connectivity with Google\\nTalk.\\n\\nhttp.conf\\nAsterisk has a very simple HTTP daemon built into it, which is used by the Asterisk\\nGUI and AJAM. This functionality is discussed in Chapter 11.\\n\\niax.conf\\nSimilar to sip.conf, the iax.conf file is where you configure options related to the IAX\\nprotocol. Your end devices and service providers are also configured here. The\\niax.conf file is covered in detail in Appendix A.\\n\\n472 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ciaxprov.conf\\nThis file is used by Asterisk to allow the system to provision and upgrade the firmware\\non an IAXy device.\\n\\nindications.conf\\nThe indications.conf file is used to tell Asterisk how to generate the various telephone\\nsounds common in different parts of the world; a dial tone in England sounds very\\ndifferent from a dial tone in Canada, but your Asterisk system will be pleased to make\\nthe sounds you want to hear. This file consists of a list of sounds a telephone system\\nmight need to produce (dial tone, busy signals, and so forth), followed by the frequencies used to generate those sounds.\\nBy default (and without an indications.conf file), Asterisk will use the tones common\\nin North America. You can change the default country for your system by specifying\\nthe two-letter country code in the [general] section. Supported country codes are listed\\nin the indications.conf.sample file located in /usr/src/asterisk/configs. If you have the\\nrequired information, your country can easily be added. Here\\'s what the configuration\\nfor North America looks like:\\n[general]\\ncountry=us\\n;\\n[us]\\ndescription = United States / North America\\nringcadance = 2000,4000\\ndial = 350+440\\nbusy = 480+620/500,0/500\\nring = 440+480/2000,0/4000\\ncongestion = 480+620/250,0/250\\ncallwaiting = 440/300,0/10000\\ndialrecall = !350+440/100,!0/100,!350+440/100,!0/100,!350+440/100,!0/100,350+440\\nrecord = 1400/500,0/15000\\ninfo = !950/330,!1400/330,!1800/330,0\\n\\njabber.conf\\nThe jabber.conf file specifies the information needed to allow Asterisk to interact with\\nan XMPP (Jabber) server.\\n\\nlogger.conf\\nThe logger.conf file specifies the type and verbosity of messages logged to the various\\nlogfiles in the /var/log/asterisk/ directory. It has two sections, [general] and [logfile].\\n\\niaxprov.conf | 473\\n\\x0c[general]\\nSettings under the [general] section are used to customize the output of the logs (and\\ncan safely be left blank, as the defaults serve most people very well). However, if you\\nlove to customize such things, read on.\\nYou can define exactly how you want your timestamps to look through the use of the\\ndateformat parameter:\\ndateformat=%F %T\\n\\nThe Linux manpage for strftime(3) lists all of the ways you can do this.\\nIf you want to append your system\\'s hostname to the names of the logfiles, set append\\nhostname=yes. This can be useful if you have a lot of systems delivering logfiles to you.\\nIf for some reason you do not want to log events from your queues, you can set\\nqueue_log=no.\\nIf generic events do not interest you, instruct Asterisk to omit them from the logfiles\\nby setting event_log=no.\\n\\n[logfiles]\\nThe [logfiles] section defines the types of information you wish to log. There are\\nmultiple ranks for the various bits of information that will be logged, and it can be\\ndesirable to separate log entries into different files. The general format for lines in the\\n[logfiles] section is filename => levels, where filename is the name of the file to save\\nthe logged information to and levels are the types of information you wish to save.\\nUsing console for the filename is a special exception that allows you to\\ncontrol the type of information sent to the Asterisk console.\\n\\nA sample [logfiles] section might look like this:\\n[logfiles]\\nconsole => notice,warning,error\\nmessages => notice,warning,error\\n\\nYou can specify logging of the following types of information:\\ndebug\\n\\nEnabling debugging gives far more detailed output about what is happening in the\\nsystem. For example, with debugging enabled, you can see what DTMF tones the\\nusers entered while accessing their voicemail boxes. Debugging information should\\nbe logged only when you are actually debugging something, as it will create massive\\nlogfiles very rapidly.\\n\\n474 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cverbose\\n\\nWhen you connect to the Asterisk console and set a verbosity of 3 or higher, you\\'ll\\nsee output on the console showing what Asterisk is doing. You can save this output\\nto a logfile by adding a line such as verbose_log => verbose to your logger.conf file.\\nNote that a high amount of verbosity can quickly eat up hard drive space.\\nnotice\\n\\nA notice is used to inform you of minor changes to the system, such as when a peer\\nchanges state. It is normal to see these types of messages, and the events they\\nindicate generally have no adverse effects on the server.\\nwarning\\n\\nA warning happens when Asterisk attempts to do something and is unsuccessful.\\nThese types of errors are usually not fatal, but they should be investigated, especially if a lot of them are seen.\\nerror\\n\\nErrors are often related to Out of Memory errors. They generally indicate serious\\nproblems that may lead to Asterisk to crash or freeze.\\n\\nmanager.conf\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface is an API that external programs can use to communicate with and control Asterisk, much as you would do from the Asterisk console.\\nThe Manager gives programs the ability to run commands and request\\ninformation from the Asterisk server. However, it is not very secure; its\\nauthentication mechanism defaults to using plain-text passwords, and\\nall connected terminals default to receiving all events. The Asterisk\\nManager should be used only on a trusted local area network, or locally\\non the box. The permit and deny constructs allow you to restrict access\\nto certain extensions or subnets.\\n\\nMany of the available graphical interfaces to Asterisk--such as the Flash Operator\\nPanel--use the Manager to pull data and determine the status of applications. The\\nmanager.conf file defines the way programs authenticate with the Manager.\\nThe Manager commands (which you can list by typing show manager commands at the\\nAsterisk console) have varying degrees of privilege. You can control the read and write\\npermissions for these commands with the use of the read and write options in the\\nmanager.conf file.\\nHere\\'s a sample manager.conf file:\\n[general]\\nenabled = no\\nport = 5038\\nbindaddr = 0.0.0.0\\n\\nmanager.conf | 475\\n\\x0c[oreilly]\\nsecret = notvery\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\n\\nFor more information on the Asterisk Manager Interface, see Chapter 10.\\n\\nmeetme.conf\\nMeetMe is one of the more remarkable applications in Asterisk. It allows you to set up\\npredefined audio conference rooms. This rather simple concept has proven to be extremely expensive to implement in every other PBX, but what seems like a big deal to\\nthem is simple to Asterisk. Whether by using a dedicated server, or through the use of\\na service, Asterisk now delivers this functionality as a standard application.\\nMeetMe conferences can be created either dynamically, with the d flag in the Dial()\\napplication, or statically in the meetme.conf file. The format for creating conference\\nrooms is as follows:\\nconf => conference_number[,pin][,administrator_pin]\\n\\nAll conferences must be defined under the [rooms] section header.\\n[rooms]\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\n\\n\\nmgcp.conf\\nThe Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) has only primitive support in Asterisk.\\nThis is likely due to the fact that SIP has stolen the limelight from every other VoIP\\nprotocol (except IAX, of course). Because of this, you should attempt to use Asterisk\\'s\\nMCGP channel in a production environment only if you are prepared to perform extensive testing, are willing to pay to have features and patches implemented within your\\ntime frames, and have in-house expertise with the protocol.\\nHaving said that, we are not prepared to pronounce MGCP dead. SIP is not yet the\\npanacea it has been touted as, and MGCP has proven itself to be very useful in carrier\\nbackbone environments. Many believe MGCP will fill a niche or void that has not yet\\nbeen discovered, and we remain interested in it.\\n\\n476 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cmodem.conf\\nThe modem.conf file is used by Asterisk to communicate with ISDN-BRI interfaces\\nthrough the ISDN4Linux driver. Since ISDN4Linux lacks many core ISDN features, it\\nis not generally used. For BRI, the most popular add-on seems to be chan_capi, available\\nfrom http://www.junghanns.net.\\n\\nmusiconhold.conf\\nThe musiconhold.conf file is used to configure different classes of music and their locations for use in music-on-hold applications. Asterisk can play hold music in any\\nnative file formats. Asterisk can also makes use of a certain version of mpg123 to play\\nMP3 files, but this is discouraged. You can specify arguments for a class, allowing you\\nto use an external application to stream music either locally or over a network.\\n\\nosp.conf\\nThe Open Settlement Protocol (OSP) is officially documented in ETSI TS 101 321, a\\nEuropean Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) document that came out of\\nthe work of the TIPHON working group. As far as we can tell, OSP is another attempt\\nto apply old-style telecom thinking to disruptive technologies.\\n\\noss.conf\\nThe oss.conf file is used to configure Asterisk to use the Open Sound System (OSS)\\ndriver to allow communications with the sound card via the CONSOLE channel. Note\\nthat ALSA is now the preferred interface for the CONSOLE channel.\\n\\nphone.conf\\nThe phone.conf file is used to configure a Quicknet PhoneJACK card. The PhoneJACK\\ncard seems to provide something like an FXS interface, in that you can plug an analog\\ntelephone into it and pass calls through Asterisk.\\n\\nprivacy.conf\\nThe privacy.conf file is used to control the maximum number of tries a user has to enter\\nhis 10-digit telephone number in the PrivacyManager() application. The\\nPrivacyManager() application determines if a Caller ID is set for the incoming call. The\\nuser enters his 10-digit number within the number of tries configured in privacy.conf,\\nthe application sets the PRIVACYMGRSTATUS channel variable to either SUCCESS or\\nFAILED. If the Caller ID is set, the application does nothing.\\nmodem.conf | 477\\n\\x0cThe PrivacyManager() application can also accept the arguments in the\\ndialplan. This allows the value to remain in memory, instead of an I/O\\noperation to the disk to read the configuration file, which you would\\nonly worry about with high usage of this application (many calls per\\nsecond).\\n\\nqueues.conf\\nAsterisk provides basic call center functionality via its queueing system, but those who\\nare using it in more mission-critical environments often report that their solutions required customization. You can do this customization in the queues.conf file.\\nThe [general] section of queues.conf contains settings that will apply to all queues. If\\nthe persistentmembers parameter is set to yes, a member that is added to the system\\nvia the AddQueueMember() application or through the Asterisk Manager Interface will be\\nstored in the AstDB, and therefore retained across a restart.\\nThe autofill parameter allows Asterisk to be more efficient in the way it distributes\\ncalls to queue members, especially if there are multiple callers in the queue and multiple\\nqueue members available to receive the call. It is recommended you set autofill to yes.\\nAnother general parameter of queues.conf is MonitorType. If set to MixMonitor, it will\\nmix the inbound and outbound audio streams. If set to Monitor, it will revert to the\\nolder method of recording the inbound and outbound audio in separate files.\\nNext you can define one or more queues by placing its name inside of square brackets\\n([]). Within each queue, the following parameters are available:\\nmusiconhold\\n\\nThis parameter allows you to configure which music-on-hold class (configured in\\nmusiconhold.conf) to use for the queue.\\nannounce\\n\\nWhen a call is presented to a member of the queue, the prompt specified by\\nannounce will be played to that agent before the caller is connected. This can be\\nuseful for agents who are logged in to more than one queue. You can specify either\\nthe full path to the file, or a path relative to /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/.\\nstrategy\\n\\nAsterisk can use six strategies to distribute calls to agents:\\nringall\\n\\nThe queue rings every available agent and connects the call to whichever agent\\nanswers first (this is the default).\\nroundrobin (deprecated)\\nThe queue cycles through the agents until it finds one who is available to take\\nthe call. roundrobin does not take into account the workload of the agents.\\nAlso, because roundrobin always starts with the first agent in the queue, this\\n478 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cstrategy is suitable only in an environment where you want your higher-ranked\\nagents to handle all calls unless they are busy, in which case the lower-ranked\\nagents may get a call.\\nleastrecent\\n\\nThe call is presented to the agent who has not been presented a call for the\\nlongest period of time.\\nfewestcalls\\n\\nThe call is presented to the agent who has received the least amount of calls.\\nThis strategy does not take into account the actual agent workloads; it considers only the number of calls they have taken (for example, an agent who\\nhas had 3 calls that each lasted for 10 minutes will be preferred over an agent\\nwho has had 5 calls each lasting 2 minutes).\\nrandom\\n\\nAs its name suggests, the random strategy chooses an agent at random. In a\\nsmall call center, this strategy may prove to be the most fair.\\nrrmemory\\n\\nThe queue cycles through the list of queue members, keeping track of which\\nmember last received a call. The next time a call needs to be distributed, Asterisk will continue from this point in the list of queue members. (This strategy\\nis known as round-robin memory). This ensures that call presentation cycles\\nthrough the agents as fairly as possible.\\nservicelevel\\n\\nIn a call center, the service level represents the maximum amount of time a caller\\nshould ideally have to wait before being presented to an agent. For example, if\\nservicelevel is set to 60 and the service level percentage is 80 percent, that means\\n80 percent of the calls that came into the queue were presented to an agent in less\\nthan 60 seconds.\\ncontext\\n\\nIf a context is assigned to a queue, the caller will be able to press a single digit to\\nexit to the corresponding extension within the configured context, if it exists. This\\naction takes the caller out of the queue, which means that she will lose her place\\nin line--be aware of this when you use this feature.\\ntimeout\\n\\nThe timeout value defines the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to let an\\nagent\\'s phone ring before deeming the agent unavailable and placing the call back\\ninto the queue.\\nretry\\n\\nWhen a timeout occurs, the retry value specifies how many seconds to wait before\\npresenting the call again to an available agent.\\n\\nqueues.conf | 479\\n\\x0cweight\\n\\nThe weight parameter assigns a rank to the queue. If calls are waiting in multiple\\nqueues, those queues with the highest weight values will be presented to agents\\nfirst. When you are designing your queues, be aware that this strategy can prevent\\na call in a lower-weighted queue from ever being answered. Always ensure that\\ncalls in lower-weighted queues eventually get promoted to higher-weighted queues\\nto ensure that they don\\'t have to hold forever.\\nmaxlen\\nmaxlen is the maximum number of calls that can be added to the queue before the\\n\\ncall goes to the next priority of the current extension.\\nannounce-frequency\\nThe announce-frequency value (defined in seconds) determines how often to an-\\n\\nnounce to the caller his place in the queue and estimated hold time.\\nannounce-holdtime\\n\\nThere are three possible values for this parameter: yes, no, and once. The announceholdtime parameter determines whether or not to include the estimated hold time\\nwithin the position announcement. If set to once, it will be played to the caller only\\nonce.\\nmonitor-format\\n\\nThis parameter accepts three possible values: wav, gsm, and wav49. By enabling this\\noption, you are telling Asterisk that you wish to record all completed calls in the\\nqueue in the format specified. If this option is not specified, no calls will be\\nrecorded.\\nmonitor-join\\nThe Monitor() application in Asterisk normally records either end of the conversation in a separate file. Setting monitor-join to yes instructs Asterisk to merge the\\nfiles at the end of the call. This should be set only if the MonitorType parameter is\\nset to Monitor.\\njoinempty\\n\\nThis parameter accepts three values: yes, no, and strict. It allows you to determine\\nwhether callers can be added to a queue based on the status of the members of the\\nqueue. The strict option will not allow callers to join the queue if all members are\\nunavailable.\\nleavewhenempty\\n\\nThis parameter determines whether you want your holding callers to be removed\\nfrom the queue when the conditions preventing a caller from joining exist (i.e.,\\nwhen all of your agents log out and go home).\\neventwhencalled\\nSet eventwhencalled to yes if you wish to have queue events presented on the Man-\\n\\nager Interface.\\n\\n480 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ceventmemberstatusoff\\n\\nSetting this parameter to no will generate extra information pertaining to each\\nqueue member.\\nreportholdtime\\n\\nIf you set this parameter to yes, the amount of time the caller held before being\\nconnected will be announced to the queue member answering the call.\\nmemberdelay\\n\\nThis parameter defines whether a delay will be inserted between the time when the\\nqueue identifies a free agent and the time when the call is connected to that agent.\\nmember => member_name\\n\\nMembers of a queue can be either channel types or agents. Any agents you list here\\nmust be defined in the agents.conf file.\\n\\nres_odbc.conf\\nThe purpose of the res_odbc.so module is to store configuration file information in a\\ndatabase and retrieve that information from the database. The res_odbc.conf file specifies how to access the table within the database. The extconfig.conf file is used to\\ndetermine how to connect to the database.\\n\\nres_snmp.conf\\nThe res_snmp.conf file is used to configure SNMP support in Asterisk. There are two\\noptions in the [general]. The subagent option specifies whether res_snmp should run\\nas a subagent or a full SNMP agent. Asterisk defaults to running as a subagent. The\\nenabled option specifies whether SNMP support in Asterisk is enabled. This defaults\\nto no, so you\\'ll need to change this if you want SNMP support.\\n\\nrpt.conf\\nThe rpt.conf file is used to configure Jim Dixon\\'s newest project, Jim\\'s Radio Repeater\\nApplication (app_rpt), allows Asterisk to communicate using VoIP via radio repeater\\ntechnology. This allows people to efficiently provide large-area coverage of wireless\\nnetworking and routing information to the amateur radio public through their local\\nhigh-speed Internet connections.\\n\\nrtp.conf\\nThe rtp.conf file controls the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) ports that Asterisk\\nuses to generate and receive RTP traffic. The RTP protocol is used by SIP, H.323,\\nMGCP, and possibly other protocols to carry media between endpoints.\\n\\nres_odbc.conf | 481\\n\\x0cThe default rtp.conf file uses the RTP port range of 10,000 through 20,000. However,\\nthis is far more ports than you\\'re likely to need, and many network administrators may\\nnot be comfortable opening up such a large range in their firewalls. You can limit the\\nRTP port range by changing the upper and lower bound limits within the rtp.conf file.\\nFor every bidirectional SIP call between two endpoints, five ports are generally used:\\nport 5060 for SIP signaling, one port for the data stream and one port for the Real-Time\\nControl Protocol (RTCP) in one direction, and an additional two ports for the data\\nstream and RTCP in the opposite direction.\\nUDP datagrams contain a 16-bit field for a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which is\\nused to verify the integrity of the datagram header and its data. It uses polynomial\\ndivision to create the 16-bit checksum from the 64-bit header. This value is then placed\\ninto the 16-bit CRC field of the datagram, which the remote end can then use to verify\\nthe integrity of the received datagram.\\nSetting rtpchecksums=no requests that the OS not do UDP checksum creating/checking\\nfor the sockets used by RTP. If you add this option to the sample rtp.conf file, it will\\nlook like this:\\n[general]\\nrtpchecksums=no\\n\\nsay.conf\\nThe say.conf file is used to configure spoken language grammar rules for a number of\\napplications, such as SayNumber(). If you\\'re looking to use Asterisk in a language that\\nisn\\'t currently supported, you can script support through the configuation options in\\nthis file.\\n\\nsip.conf\\nThe sip.conf file defines all the SIP protocol options for Asterisk. The authentication\\nfor endpoints, such as SIP phones and service providers, is also configured in this file.\\nAsterisk uses the sip.conf file to determine which calls you are willing to accept and\\nwhere those calls should go in relation to your dialplan. Many SIP-related options are\\nconfigured in sip.conf, which was covered in depth in Appendix A.\\n\\nsip_notify.conf\\nAsterisk has the ability to remotely notify a SIP phone to recheck its configuration files\\nor reboot by sending it a specially formatted, manufacturer-specific NOTIFY message\\n\\n482 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0c(defined in sip_notify.conf). Because each of these messages is manufacturer-specific,\\nsupport varies from phone to phone.\\n\\nskinny.conf\\nIf you wish to connect to phones using Cisco\\'s proprietary Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP), you can use the skinny.conf file to define the parameters and channels\\nthat will use it. However, since the SCCP protocol is proprietary, you may find that\\nsupport in Asterisk for this protocol is less than perfect but steadily improving over time.\\n\\nsla.conf\\nEven though Asterisk is a modern PBX, many people still want it to behave like an old\\nkey system with shared lines. Asterisk can emulate a key system by configuring shared\\nlines in sla.conf.\\n\\nsmdi.conf\\nThis file configures the Station Message Desk Interface. SMDI is a very useful addition\\nto Asterisk, as it will allow it to act as a voicemail system for legacy PBXes that support\\nthe SMDI protocol.\\n\\nudptl.conf\\nThis file is used for the configuration of Asterisk\\'s support for UDPTL packets. UDPTL\\npackets are one of the transports used by T.38 faxing over IP connections.\\n\\nusers.conf\\nWith the advent of the Asterisk GUI, the Asterisk developers found it would be helpful\\nto create a configuration file where user accounts can be specified, instead of having\\ndifferent pieces spread across a myriad of files (such as extensions.conf, sip.conf, and\\nvoicemail.conf. This file is also updated by the Asterisk GUI when new users are added\\nto the system or when user settings are modified.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf\\nThe voicemail.conf file controls the Asterisk voicemail system (called Comedian Mail).\\nIt consists of three main sections. The first, called [general], sets the general systemwide settings for the voicemail system. The second, called [zonemessages], allows you\\nto configure different voicemail zones, which are a collection of time and time zone\\n\\nskinny.conf | 483\\n\\x0csettings. The third and final section is where you create one or more groups of voicemail\\nboxes, each containing the mailbox definitions. For more information on adding voicemail capabilities to your dialplan, see Chapter 6.\\n\\nGeneral Voicemail Settings\\nThe [general] section of voicemail.conf contains a plethora of options that affect the\\nentire voicemail system:\\nformat\\n\\nLists the codecs that should be used to save voicemail messages. Codecs should be\\nseparated with the pipe character (|). The first format specified is the format used\\nwhen attaching a voicemail message to an email. Defaults to wav49|gsm|wav. The\\nreason that the voicemail might be saved in several different formats is to minimize\\nthe amount of transcoding that Asterisk does when the voicemail is played back.\\nserveremail\\n\\nProvides the email address from which voicemail notifications should be sent.\\nattach\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should attach the voicemail sound file to the\\nvoicemail notification email.\\nmaxmsg\\n\\nSets the maximum number of messages that may be kept in any voicemail folder.\\nmaxmessage\\n\\nSets the maximum length of a voicemail message, in seconds.\\nminmessage\\n\\nSets the minimum length of a voicemail message, in seconds.\\nmaxgreet\\n\\nSets the maximum length of voicemail greetings, in seconds.\\nskipms\\n\\nSpecifies how many milliseconds to skip forward/back when the user skips forward\\nor backward during message playback.\\nmaxsilence\\n\\nIndicates how many seconds of silence to allow before ending the recording.\\nsilencethreshold\\n\\nSets the silence threshold (what we consider \"silence\"--the lower the threshold is,\\nthe more sensitive it is).\\nmaxlogins\\n\\nSets the maximum allowed number of failed login attempts.\\nuserscontext\\n\\nSpecifies which voicemail context the mailboxes defined in users.conf should be a\\npart of. This defaults to the default voicemail context.\\n\\n484 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cexternnotify\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of an external program to be executed when a\\nvoicemail is left or delivered, or when a mailbox is checked. It can also be set to\\nsmdi to use SMDI for external notification. If it is smdi, the smdiport should be set\\nto a valid port as specified in smdi.conf.\\nsmdiport\\n\\nSpecifies the communications port used by SMDI. This should correspond to a\\nvalid port as specified in smdi.conf. This is used when the externnotify setting is\\nset to smdi.\\nexternpass\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of an external program to be executed whenever\\na voicemail password is changed.\\ndirectoryintro\\n\\nIf set, overrides the default introduction to the dial-by-name directory.\\ncharset\\n\\nDefines the character set for voicemail messages.\\nadsifdn\\n\\nSpecifies the ADSI feature descriptor number to download to.\\nadsisec\\n\\nSets the ADSI security lock code.\\nadsiver\\n\\nIndicates the ADSI voicemail application version number.\\npbxskip\\n\\nCauses Asterisk not to add the string [PBX]: to the beginning of the subject line of\\na voicemail notification email.\\nfromstring:\\nChanges the From: string of voicemail notification email messages.\\nusedirectory\\n\\nPermits a mailbox owner to select entries from the dial-by-name directory for forwarding and/or composing new voicemail messages.\\nodbcstorage\\n\\nIf support for ODBC voicemail storage has been compiled into Asterisk, this option\\nallows you to specify which ODBC connection to use. ODBC connections are\\ndefined in res_odbc.conf.\\nodbctable\\n\\nThis option is used in conjunction with the odbcstorage option. This option specifies which database table to use for voicemail messages.\\nemailsubject\\n\\nSpecifies the email subject of voicemail notification email messages.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 485\\n\\x0cpagerfromstring\\n\\nChanges the From: string of voicemail notification pager messages.\\nemailbody\\n\\nSupplies the email body of voicemail notification email messages.\\nPlease note that all the emailsubject, emailbody, pagersubject, and\\npagerbody settings can use the following variables to provide more\\nin-depth information about the voicemail:\\n VM_NAME\\n VM_DUR\\n VM_MSGNUM\\n VM_MAILBOX\\n VM_CALLERID\\n VM_CIDNUM\\n VM_CIDNAME\\n VM_DATE\\n\\nemaildateformat\\n\\nSpecifies the format of the date and time for outbound email notifications. For\\nmore information on the format, see the strftime(3) manpage.\\nmailcmd\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of the program Asterisk should use to send\\nnotification emails. This option is useful if you want to override the default email\\nprogram.\\nnextaftercmd\\n\\nSkips to the next message after the user hits 7 or 9 to delete or save the current\\nmessage. This can be set only globally at this time, not on a per-mailbox basis.\\n\\nVoicemail Zones\\nAs voicemail users may be located in different geographical locations, Asterisk provides\\na way to configure the time zone and the way the time is announced for different callers.\\nEach unique combination is known as a voicemail zone. You configure your voicemail\\nzones in the [zonemessages] section of voicemail.conf. Later, you can assign your voicemail boxes to use the settings for one of these zones.\\nEach voicemail zone definition consists of a line with the following syntax:\\nzonename=timezone | time_format\\n\\nThe zonename is an arbitrary name used to identify the zone. The timezone argument is\\nthe name of a system time zone, as found in /usr/share/zoneinfo. The time_format ar-\\n\\n486 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cgument specifies how times should be announced by the voicemail system. The\\ntime_format argument is made up of the following elements:\\n\\' filename \\'\\n\\nThe filename of a sound file to play (single quotes around the filename are required)\\n${VAR}\\n\\nVariable substitution\\nA or a\\n\\nThe day of the week (Saturday, Sunday, etc.)\\nB or b or h\\nThe name of the month (January, February, etc.)\\nd or e\\nThe numeric day of the month (first, second... thirty-first)\\nY\\n\\nThe year\\nI or l\\n\\nThe hour, in 12-hour format\\nH\\n\\nThe hour, in 24-hour format--single-digit hours are preceded by \"oh\"\\nk\\n\\nThe hour, in 24-hour format--single-digit hours are not preceded by \"oh\"\\nM\\n\\nThe minute\\nP or p\\n\\nA.M. or .P.M.\\nQ\\n\\n\"today\", \"yesterday,\" or ABdY (note: not standard strftime value)\\nq\\n\\n\"\" (for today), \"yesterday\", weekday, or ABdY (note: not standard strftime value)\\nR\\n\\n24-hour time, including minutes\\nFor example, the following example sets up two different voicemail zones, one for the\\nCentral time zone in 12-hour format, and a second in the Mountain time zone, in 24hour format:\\n[zonemessages]\\ncentral=America/Chicago|\\'vm-received\\' Q \\'digits/at\\' IMp\\nmountain24=America/Denver|\\'vm-received\\' q \\'digits/at\\' H \\'digits/hundred\\' M \\'hours\\'\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 487\\n\\x0cDefining Voicemail Contexts and Mailboxes\\nNow that the system-wide settings and voicemail zones have been set, you can define\\nyour voicemail contexts and individual mailboxes.\\nVoicemail contexts are used to separate out different groups of voicemail users. For\\nexample, if you are using Asterisk to host voicemail for more than one company, you\\nshould place each company\\'s mailboxes in different voicemail contexts, to keep them\\nseparate. You might also use voicemail contexts to create per-department dial-by-name\\ndirectories.\\nTo define a new voicemail context, simply put the context name inside of square\\nbrackets, like this:\\n[default]\\n\\nInside a voicemail context, each mailbox definition takes the following syntax:\\nmailbox=password,name[,email[,pager_email[,options]]]\\n\\nThe mailbox argument is the mailbox number.\\nThe password argument is the numeric code the mailbox owner must enter to access\\nhis voicemail. If the password is preceded by a minus sign (-), the password may not\\nbe changed by the mailbox owner.\\nIf the password is set to d, then this line is assumed to provide an alternate name that can be used for this mailbox in the dial-by-name\\ndirectory. In the following example, people can reach extension 123 by\\nsearching for either Robert or Bob, along with a popular misspelling of\\nhis last name:\\n123 => d,Bob Schauerhamer\\n123 => d,Robert Showerhammer\\n\\nThe email and pager_email arguments are email addresses where voicemail notifications will be sent. These may be left blank if you don\\'t want to send voicemail\\nnotifications via email. The message sent to the pager_email address is usually shorter\\nand suitable for sending to a cell phone (via an email to SMS gateway) or to an alphanumeric pager.\\nThe options argument is a pipe-separated list of voicemail options that may be specified\\nfor the mailbox. (These options may also be set globally by placing them in the\\n[general] section.) Valid voicemail options include:\\ntz\\n\\nSets the voicemail zone from the [zonemessages] section earlier. This option is\\nirrelevant if envelope is set to no.\\n\\n488 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cattach\\n\\nAttaches the voicemail to the notification email (but not to the pager email). May\\nbe set to either yes or no.\\nattachfmt\\n\\nSpecifies the format of the voicemail message that should be attached to the message sent to the notification email. Ordinarily, Asterisk uses the first format\\nspecified in the format parameter listed in [general] (covered earlier), but this may\\nalso be changed on a per-mailbox basis. This option may be set only on a permailbox basis.\\nThis option is often used if Windows users want wav49 attachments but Linux\\nusers want their attachments in gsm format.\\nsaycid\\n\\nSays the Caller ID information before the message.\\ncidinternalcontexts\\n\\nSets the internal context for name playback instead of extension digits when saying\\nthe Caller ID information.\\nsayduration\\n\\nTurns on/off the duration information before the message. Defaults to on.\\nsaydurationm\\n\\nSpecifies the minimum duration to say when sayduration is on. Default is two\\nminutes.\\ndialout\\n\\nSpecifies the context to dial out from (by choosing option 4 from the advanced\\nmenu). If not specified, dialing out from the voicemail system will not be permitted.\\nsendvoicemail\\n\\nSpecifies the context to send voicemail from (by choosing option 5 from the advanced menu). If not specified, sending messages from within the voicemail system\\nwill not be permitted.\\nsearchcontexts\\n\\nBy default, Asterisk searches only the default context if no context is specified. To\\nhave Asterisk search all contexts, set this option to yes.\\ncallback\\n\\nSpecifies the context to call back from. If not specified, calling the sender back from\\nwithin the voicemail system will not be permitted.\\nreview\\n\\nAllows senders to review/re-record their messages before saving them. Defaults to\\noff.\\noperator\\n\\nAllows senders to hit 0 before, after, or while leaving a voicemail message to reach\\nan operator. Defaults to off.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 489\\n\\x0cenvelope\\n\\nTurns on/off envelope playback before message playback. Defaults to on. This does\\nnot affect option 3,3 from the advanced options menu.\\ndelete\\n\\nDeletes voicemails from the server after notification is sent. This option may be set\\nonly on a per-mailbox basis; it is intended for use with users who wish to receive\\ntheir voicemail messages only by email.\\nvolgain\\n\\nIf your voicemail attachments to email are too quiet, you can set this option to\\nincrease the gain on the message before it is attached to the email notification.\\nThis option only works if the sox application has been installed on\\nyour Asterisk system.\\n\\nforcename\\n\\nForces new users to record their names. A new user is determined by the password\\nbeing the same as the mailbox number. Defaults to no.\\nforcegreetings\\n\\nForces new users to record greetings. A new user is determined by the password\\nbeing the same as the mailbox number. Defaults to no.\\nhidefromdir\\n\\nHides the mailbox from the dial-by-name directory. Defaults to no.\\ntempgreetwarn\\n\\nWarns users that their temporary greeting is still enabled.\\nYou can specify multiple options by separating them with the pipe character, as shown\\nin the definitions for mailboxes 102 and 103 below.\\nHere are some sample mailbox definitions:\\n[default]\\n; regular mailbox with email notification\\n; more advanced mailbox with email and pager notification and a couple of\\n; special options\\nattach=no|tz=central\\n; a mailbox with no email notification and lots of extra options\\n103 => 6522,John Q.

See the sample vpb.conf\\nfor more information.\\n\\nzapata.conf\\nThe zapata.conf file is used to define the relationship between Asterisk and the Zaptel\\ndriver. Because zapata.conf is specific to Asterisk, it is located with the other Asterisk\\nconfiguration files in /etc/asterisk/. As with zaptel.conf, the zapata.conf file contains a\\nmultitude of choices reflecting the multitude of hardware it supports, and we won\\'t try\\nto list all of the options here. In this book we\\'ve covered only the analog interfaces to\\nthe Zaptel driver, as described in Chapter 3.\\n\\nzaptel.conf\\nThe zaptel.conf file is not located with the other Asterisk .conf files; the Zaptel driver is\\navailable to any application that can make use of it, so it makes more sense to store it\\nin a non-Asterisk-specific directory (/etc/). zaptel.conf is parsed by the ztcfg program to\\nconfigure the TDM hardware elements in your system. You configure three main elements in the zaptel.conf file:\\n A way of identifying the interfaces on the card within the dialplan\\n The type of signaling the interface requires\\n The tone language associated with a particular interface, as found in zonedata.c\\nBe very careful not to plug your FXS module into a telephone line. The\\nvoltage associated with the phone line, especially during an incoming\\ncall, will be much too high for the module to handle and may permanently damage it, rendering it useless!\\n\\nWithin the zaptel.conf file, we define the type of signaling that the channel is going to\\nuse. We also define which channels to load. The options in the configuration file are\\nthe information that will be used to configure the channels with the ztcfg command.\\nThe actual parameters available in the zaptel.conf file are quite extensive, as a wide\\nvariety of PSTN interfaces make use of the Zaptel telephony engine. Also, as this technology is rapidly evolving, anything we write now may not be accurate by the time you\\nread it. Consequently, we won\\'t try to list all of the options here.\\nIn this book, we have focused on the Zaptel analog interfaces as provided by the Digium\\nTDM400P card (see Chapter 3).\\n\\nvpb.conf | 491\\n\\x0c\\x0cAPPENDIX E\\n\\nAsterisk Dialplan Functions\\n\\nDialplan functions are very powerful, and once you begin using them, you will wonder\\nhow you got along without them.

CUT() is designed to help you\\nwork with data that may have multiple, variable-length sections, divided by a common\\ndelimiter.\\nThe most common case is the name of a channel, which is composed of two parts, a\\nbase name and a unique identifier (e.g., SIP/tom-abcd1234 or SIP/bert-1a2b3c4d).\\nCUT() may be used to trim the unique identifier, no matter how long the base name may\\nbe:\\n; Trim the unique identifier from the current channel name\\nexten => 123,1,Set(chan=${CUT(CHANNEL,-,1)})\\n\\nvarname is the name of the variable that will be operated on. Note that CUT() operates\\non the name of a variable, rather than upon the value of a variable. CUT() is somewhat\\nunique in this regard.\\nchar-delim is the character that will serve as the delimiter (\\'-\\' is the default)\\nrange-spec allows you to define which fields are returned. The range-spec can be specified as a range with - (e.g., 1-3) or a group of ranges and field numbers by separating\\neach with & (e.g., 1&3-4). Note that if multiple field numbers are specified, the resulting\\n\\nvalue will have its fields separated by the same delimiter.\\nrange-spec uses a 1-based offset.

Starfish are\\nclassified as Asteroidea. They are a group of echinoderms, spiny-skinned invertebrates\\nfound only in the sea. Most starfish have fivefold symmetry (arms or rays in multiples\\nof five), though some species can have four or nine arms. But all starfish are radially\\nsymmetrical: they have arms or rays branching out from a central body disc. There are\\nover 1,500 species of starfish.\\nStarfish live on the floor of the sea and in tidal pools, clinging to rocks and moving\\n(slowly) using a water-based vascular system to manipulate their hundreds of tiny, tubelike legs, called podia. A small bulb or ampulla at the top of the tube contracts, expelling\\nwater and expanding the starfish\\'s leg. The ampulla relaxes, and the leg retracts. Starfish\\nuse muscles to bend their legs, but it is the flow of water pressure that keeps the feet\\nmoving. At the tip of each leg, starfish have suction cups that allow them to pry open\\nclam, oyster, or mussel shells. Many starfish can push their stomachs out through their\\nmouths in order to digest their prey in its shell. Starfish are carnivores; they eat coral,\\nfish, and snails, as well as bivalves.\\nStarfish can flex and rearrange their arms to fit into small places as they move over the\\nocean floor. At the end of each arm, they have eyespots, primitive sensors that detect\\nlight and help the starfish determine direction. Starfish also have the ability to regenerate a missing limb. Some species can even regrow a complete, new starfish from a\\nsevered arm.\\nThe cover image is from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover font is Adobe ITC\\nGaramond.

Now many view it as dated and badly in need of a rewrite rather than a simple upgrade. Windows 95 is the most popular operating system in the world--but\\nthis operating system is in many ways a copy of the Mac OS, less the Mac\\'s character. Many programmers and computer enthusiasts enjoy the command-line interface power of Unix--but Unix isn\\'t nearly intuitive enough for the average end\\nuser. What users really want is an operating system that has an easy-to-use graphical user interface, takes advantage of the power of today\\'s fast microprocessor\\nchips, and is unencumbered with the burdens of backward compatibility. Enter Be,\\nInc., and the BeOS--the Be operating system.\\nIn this introductory chapter, you\\'ll learn about the features of the BeOS from a\\nprogrammer\\'s perspective. In particular, you\\'ll read about the terminology relating\\nto the Be operating system. You\\'ll also get an overview of the layout of the application programming interface, or API, that you\\'ll be using to aid you in piecing\\ntogether your programs. After the overview, you\\'ll look at some of the fundamentals of writing applications for the BeOS. No attempt will be made to supply you\\nwith a full understanding of the concepts, techniques, and tricks of programming\\nfor this operating system--you\\'ve got the whole rest of the book for that! Instead,\\nin this chapter I\\'ll just give you a feel for what it\\'s like to write a program for the\\nBeOS. Finally, this chapter concludes with a first look at Metrowerks CodeWarrior--the integrated development environment you\\'ll be using to develop your\\nown applications that run on the BeOS.\\n\\nFeatures of the BeOS\\nWith any new technology comes a plethora of buzzwords. This marketing hype is\\nespecially true in the computer industry--innovative software and hardware seem\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nto appear almost daily, and each company needs some way to ensure that the\\npublic views their product as the best. Unsurprisingly, the BeOS is also accompanied by a number of buzzwords--multithreaded, multiprocessor support, and\\npreemptive multitasking being a few. What may be surprising is that this nomenclature, when applied to BeOS, isn\\'t just hype--these phrases really do define this\\nexciting operating system!\\n\\nMultithreaded\\nA thread is a path of execution--a part of a program that acts independently from\\nother parts of the program, yet is still capable of sharing data with the rest of program. An OS that is multithreaded allows a single program to be divided into several threads, with each thread carrying out its own task. The processor devotes a\\nsmall amount of time first to one thread and then to another, repeating this cycle\\nfor as long as it takes to carry out whatever task each thread is to perform. This\\nparallel processing allows the end user to carry out one action while another is\\ntaking place. Multithreading doesn\\'t come without a price--though fortunately in\\nthe BeOS this price is a rather small one. A program that creates multiple threads\\nneeds to be able to protect its data against simultaneous access from different\\nthreads. The technique of locking information when it is being accessed is one\\nthat is relatively easy to implement in BeOS programs.\\nThe BeOS is a multithreaded operating system--and a very efficient one. While\\nprogrammers can explicitly create threads, much of the work of handling threads\\nis taken care of behind the scenes by the operating system itself. For instance,\\nwhen a window is created in a program, the BeOS creates and maintains a separate thread for that one window.\\n\\nMultiprocessor Support\\nAn operating system that uses multithreading, designed so that threads can be sent\\nto different processors, is said to use symmetric multiprocessing, or SMP. On an\\nSMP system, unrelated threads can be sent to different processors. For instance, a\\nprogram could send a thread that is to carry out a complex calculation to one processor and, at the same time, send a thread that is to be used to transfer a file over\\na network to a second processor. Contrasting with symmetric multiprocessing\\n(SMP) is asymmetric multiprocessing, or AMP. A system that uses AMP sends a\\nthread to one processor (deemed the master processor) which in turn parcels out\\nsubtasks to the other processor or processors (called the slave processor or processors).\\nThe BeOS can run on single-processor systems (such as single-processor Power\\nMacintosh computers), but it is designed to take full advantage of machines that\\n\\x0cFeatures of the BeOS\\n\\n\\nhave more than one processor--it uses symmetric multiprocessing. When a Be\\nprogram runs on a multiprocessor machine, the program can send threads to each\\nprocessor for true parallel processing. Best of all, the programmer doesn\\'t need to\\nbe concerned about how to evenly divide the work load. The Be operating system is responsible for distributing tasks among whatever number of processors are\\non the host machine--whether that be one, two, four, or more CPUs.\\nThe capability to run different threads on different processors, coupled with the\\nsystem\\'s ability to assign threads to processors based on the current load on each\\nprocessor, makes for a system with very high performance.\\n\\nPreemptive Multitasking\\nAn operating system that utilizes multitasking is one that allows more than one\\nprogram to run simultaneously. If that operating system has cooperative multitasking, it\\'s up to each running program to yield control of system resources to allow\\nthe other running applications to perform their chores. In other words, programs\\nmust cooperate. In a cooperative multitasking environment, programs can be\\nwritten such that they don\\'t cooperate graciously--or even such that they don\\'t\\ncooperate at all. A better method of implementing multitasking is for an operating\\nsystem to employ preemptive multitasking. In a preemptive multitasking environment the operating system can, and does, preempt currently running applications.\\nWith preemptive multitasking, the burden of passing control from one program to\\nanother falls on the operating system rather than on running applications. The\\nadvantage is that no one program can grab and retain control of system resources.\\nIf you haven\\'t already guessed, the BeOS has preemptive multitasking. The BeOS\\nmicrokernel (a low-level task manager discussed later in this chapter) is responsible for scheduling tasks according to priority levels. All tasks are allowed use of a\\nprocessor for only a very short time--three-thousandths of a second. If a program\\ndoesn\\'t completely execute a task in one such time-slice, it will pick up where it\\nleft off the next time it regains use of a processor.\\n\\nProtected Memory\\nWhen a program launches, the operating system reserves an area of RAM and\\nloads a copy of that program\\'s code into this memory. This area of memory is then\\ndevoted to this application--and to this application only. While a program running under any operating system doesn\\'t intentionally write to memory locations\\nreserved for use by other applications, it can inadvertently happen (typically when\\nthe offending program encounters a bug in its code). When a program writes outside of its own address space, it may result in incorrect results or an aborted program. Worse still, it could result in the entire system crashing.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nAn operating system with protected memory gives each running program its own\\nmemory space that can\\'t be accessed by other programs. The advantage to memory protection should be obvious: while a bug in a program may crash that program, the entire system won\\'t freeze and a reboot won\\'t be necessary. The BeOS\\nhas protected memory. Should a program attempt to access memory outside its\\nown well-defined area, the BeOS will terminate the rogue program while leaving\\nany other running applications unaffected. To the delight of users, their machines\\nrunning BeOS rarely crash.\\n\\nVirtual Memory\\nTo accommodate the simultaneous running of several applications, some operating systems use a memory scheme called virtual memory. Virtual memory is\\nmemory other than RAM that is devoted to holding application code and data.\\nTypically, a system reserves hard drive space and uses that area as virtual memory. As a program executes, the processor shuffles application code and data\\nbetween RAM and virtual memory. In effect, the storage space on the storage\\ndevice is used as an extension of RAM.\\nThe BeOS uses virtual memory to provide each executing application with the\\nrequired memory. For any running application, the system first uses RAM to handle the program\\'s needs. If there is a shortage of available physical memory, the\\nsystem then resorts to hard drive space as needed.\\n\\nLess Hindered by Backward Compatibility\\nWhen a company such as Apple or Microsoft sets about to upgrade its operating\\nsystem, it must take into account the millions of users that have a large investment in software designed to run on the existing version of its operating system.\\nSo no matter how radical the changes and improvements are to a new version of\\nan operating system, the new OS typically accommodates these users by supplying backward compatibility.\\nBackward compatibility--the ability to run older applications as well as programs\\nwritten specifically for the new version of the OS--helps keep the installed base of\\nusers happy. But backward compatibility has a downside: it keeps an upgrade to\\nan operating system from reaching its true potential. In order to keep programs\\nthat were written for old technologies running, the new OS cannot include some\\nnew technologies that would \"break\" these existing applications. As a new operating system, the BeOS had no old applications to consider. It was designed to take\\nfull advantage of today\\'s fast hardware and to incorporate all the available modern programming techniques. As subsequent releases of the BeOS are made available, backward compatibility does become an issue. But it will be quite a while\\n\\x0cStructure of the BeOS\\n\\n\\nbefore original applications need major overhauling (as is the case for, say, a Macintosh application written for an early version of the Mac OS).\\n\\nStructure of the BeOS\\nBe applications run on hardware driven by either Intel or PowerPC microprocessors (check the BeOS Support Guides page at http://www.be.com/support/guides/\\nfor links to lists of exactly which Intel and PowerPC machines are currently supported). Between the hardware and applications lies the BeOS software. As shown\\nin Figure 1-1, the operating system software consists of three layers: a microkernel\\nlayer that communicates with the computer\\'s hardware, a server layer consisting of\\na number of servers that each handle the low-level work of common tasks (such\\nas printing), and a software kit layer that holds several software kits--shared\\nlibraries (known as dynamically linked libraries, or DLLs, to some programmers)\\nthat act as a programmer\\'s interface to the servers and microkernel.\\nApplication\\nSoftware Kits\\n\\nServer\\nMicrokernel\\nHardware\\nFigure 1-1. The layers of the BeOS reside between applications and hardware\\n\\nMicrokernel\\nThe bottom layer consists of the microkernel. The microkernel works directly with\\nthe hardware of the host machine, as well as with device drivers. The code that\\nmakes up the microkernel handles low-level tasks critical to the control of the\\ncomputer. For instance, the microkernel manages access to memory. The kernel\\nalso provides the building blocks that other programs use: thread scheduling, the\\nfile system tools, and memory-locking primitives.\\n\\nServers\\nAbove the microkernel lies the server layer. This layer is composed of a number of\\nservers--processes that run in the background and carry out tasks for applications\\nthat are currently executing. For example, the purpose of the Input Server is\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nto handle access to all the various keyboards, mice, joysticks, and other input\\ndevices that may be connected to a machine running the BeOS. Another server\\nis the Application Server, a very important server that handles the display of\\ngraphics and application communication. As a programmer you won\\'t work\\ndirectly with servers; instead, you\\'ll rely on software kits to access the power of\\nthe server software.\\n\\nKits\\nAbove the server layer is the software kit layer. A kit consists of a number of\\nobject-oriented classes that a programmer makes use of when writing a BeOS program. Collectively the classes in the software kits comprise the BeOS API. You\\nknow that the abbreviation API stands for application programming interface. But\\nwhat does the application interface to? Other software. For Be applications, the\\nkits are the interface to the various servers. For instance, the Application Kit holds\\nseveral classes used by programmers in your position who are trying to create\\ntools for users. The programmer writes code that invokes methods that are a part\\nof the classes of the Application Kit, and the Application Kit then communicates\\nwith the Application Server to perform the specified task. A couple of the other\\nservers you\\'ll encounter in your Be programming endeavors are the Print Server\\nand the Media Server.\\nSome kits don\\'t rely on servers to carry out microkernel-related operations--the\\nchores they take care of may be simple and straightforward enough that they don\\'t\\nneed their own server software. Instead, these kits directly invoke microkernel\\ncode. As you can see in Figure 1-1, an application relies directly on the software\\nkits and indirectly on the servers and microkernel.\\nAs you become more proficient at BeOS programming, you\\'ll also become more\\nintimate with the classes that comprise the various software kits. Now that you\\nknow this, you\\'ll realize that it is no accident that the majority of this book is\\ndevoted to understanding the purpose of, and working with, the various BeOS\\nkits.\\n\\nThis book is tutorial in nature. Its purpose is to get you acquainted\\nwith the process of developing applications that run on the BeOS\\nand to provide an overview of the BeOS API. Its purpose isn\\'t to\\ndocument the dozens of classes and hundreds of member functions\\nthat make up the BeOS API. After--or while--reading this book, you\\nmay want such a reference. If you do, consider the books Be Developer\\'s Guide and Be Advanced Topics, also by O\\'Reilly & Associates.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\nThe application programming interface of the BeOS is object-oriented--the code\\nthat makes up the software kits is written in C++. If you have experience programming in C++ on any platform, you\\'re already at the midpoint in your journey to\\nbecoming adept at BeOS programming. Now you just need to become proficient\\nin the layout and use of the classes that make up the software kits.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Overview\\nThe BeOS consists of about a dozen software kits--the number is growing as the\\nBeOS is enhanced. Don\\'t panic, though--you won\\'t be responsible for knowing\\nabout all the classes in all of the kits. Very simple applications require only the\\nclasses from a very few of the kits. For instance, an application that simply displays a window that holds text uses the Application Kit and the Interface Kit. A\\nmore complex application requires more classes from more kits. Presentation software that stores sound and video data in files, for example, might require the use\\nof classes from the Storage Kit, the Media Kit, and the Network Kit--as well as\\nclasses from the two previously mentioned kits. While it\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll ever\\nwrite a program that uses all of the BeOS kits, it\\'s a good idea to at least have an\\nidea of the purpose of each.\\n\\nThe kits of the BeOS are subject to change. As the BeOS matures,\\nnew functionality will be added. This functionality will be supported\\nby new classes in existing kits and, perhaps, entirely new software\\nkits.\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nThe Application Kit is a small but vitally important kit. Because every application is based on a class derived from the BApplication class that is defined\\nin this kit, every application uses the Application Kit.\\nThe Application Kit defines a messaging system (described later in this chapter) that makes applications aware of events (such as a click of a mouse button by the user). This kit also give applications the power to communicate\\nwith one another.\\nInterface Kit\\nThe Interface Kit is by far the largest of the software kits. The classes of this\\nkit exist to supply applications with a graphical user interface that fully supports user interaction. The definition of windows and the elements that are\\ncontained in windows (such as scrollbars, buttons, lists, and text) are handled\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nby classes in this kit. Any program that opens at least one window uses the\\nInterface Kit.\\nStorage Kit\\nThe Storage Kit holds the classes that store and update data on disks. Programs that work with files will work with the Storage Kit.\\nSupport Kit\\nAs its name suggests, the contents of the Support Kit support the other kits.\\nHere you\\'ll find the definitions of datatypes, constants, and a few classes.\\nBecause the Support Kit defines many of the basic elements of the BeOS (such\\nas the Boolean constants true and false), all applications use this kit.\\nMedia Kit\\nThe Media Kit is responsible for the handling of real-time data. In particular,\\nthis kit defines classes that are used to process audio and video data.\\nMidi Kit\\nThe Midi Kit is used for applications that process MIDI (Musical Instrument\\nDigital Interface) data.\\nKernel Kit\\nThe Kernel Kit is used by applications that require low-level access to the\\nBeOS microkernel. This kit defines classes that allow programmers to explicitly create and maintain threads.\\nDevice Kit\\nThe Device Kit provides interfaces to hardware connectors (such as the serial\\nport), and is necessary only for programmers who are developing drivers.\\nNetwork Kit\\nThe Network Kit exists to provide TCP/IP services to applications.\\nOpenGL Kit\\nThe OpenGL Kit provides classes that allow programmers to add 3D capabilities to their programs. The classes aid in the creation and manipulation of\\nthree-dimensional objects.\\nTranslation Kit\\nThe Translation Kit is useful when a program needs to convert data from one\\nmedia format to another. For instance, a program that can import an image of\\none format (such as a JPEG image) but needs to convert that image to another\\nformat might make use of this kit.\\nMail Kit\\nThe Mail Kit assists in adding Internet email services (such as sending messages using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to an application).\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nGame Kit\\nThe Game Kit--which is under development as of this writing--consists of\\ntwo major classes that support game developers.\\n\\nBeOS Naming Conventions\\nSome of the many classes that make up the BeOS are discussed a little later. As\\nthey\\'re introduced, you\\'ll notice that each starts with an uppercase letter \"B,\" as in\\nBMessage, BApplication, and BControl. This is no accident, of course--the\\nsoftware of the kits follows a naming convention.\\nThe BeOS software kits consist of classes (which contain member functions and\\ndata members), constants, and global variables. The BeOS imposes a naming convention on each of these types of elements so that anyone reading your code can\\nreadily distinguish between code that is defined by the BeOS and code that is\\ndefined by your own program. Table 1-1 lists these conventions.\\nTable 1-1. BeOS Naming Conventions\\nCategory\\n\\nPrefix\\n\\nSpelling\\n\\nExample\\n\\nClass name\\n\\nB\\n\\nBegin words with uppercase letter\\n\\nBRect\\n\\nMember function\\n\\nnone\\n\\nBegin words with uppercase letter\\n\\nOffsetBy()\\n\\nData member\\n\\nnone\\n\\nBegin words (excepting the first) with\\nuppercase letter\\n\\nbottom\\n\\nConstant\\n\\nB_\\n\\nAll uppercase\\n\\nB_LONG_TYPE\\n\\nGlobal variable\\n\\nbe_\\n\\nAll lowercase\\n\\nbe_clipboard\\n\\nClasses of the BeOS always begin with an uppercase \"B\" (short for \"BeOS\", of\\ncourse). Following the \"B\" prefix, the first letter of each word in the class name\\nappears in uppercase, while the remainder of the class name appears in\\nlowercase. Examples of class names are BButton, BTextView, BList, and\\nBScrollBar.\\nMember functions that are defined by BeOS classes have the first letter of each\\nword in uppercase and the remainder of the function name in lowercase. Examples of BeOS class member function names are GetFontInfo(), KeyDown(),\\nFrame(), and Highlight().\\nData members that are defined by BeOS classes have the first letter of each word\\nin uppercase and the remainder of the data member name in lowercase, with the\\nexception of the first word--it always begins in lowercase. Examples of BeOS\\nclass data member names are rotation and what.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nI\\'ve included only a couple of examples of data member names\\nbecause I had a hard time finding any! Be engineers went to great\\nlengths to hide data members. If you peruse the Be header files\\nyou\\'ll find a number of data members--but most are declared private and are used by the classes themselves rather than by you, the\\nprogrammer. You\\'ll typically make things happen in your code by\\ninvoking member functions (which themselves may access or alter\\nprivate data members) rather than by working directly with any data\\nmembers.\\n\\nConstants defined by BeOS always begin with an uppercase \"B\" followed by an\\nunderscore. The remainder of the constant\\'s name is in uppercase, with an underscore between words. Examples include: B_WIDTH_FROM_LABEL, B_WARNING_\\nALERT, B_CONTROL_ON, and B_BORDER_FRAME.\\nThe BeOS software includes some global variables. Such a variable begins with the\\nprefix \"be_\" and is followed by a lowercase name, as in: be_app, be_roster, and\\nbe_clipboard.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Inheritance Hierarchies\\nThe relationships between classes of a software kit can be shown in the inheritance hierarchy for that kit. Figure 1-2 shows such an inheritance hierarchy for the\\nlargest kit, the Interface Kit.\\n\\nThe kits that make up the BeOS don\\'t exist in isolation from one\\nanother. A class from one kit may be derived from a class defined in\\na different kit. The BWindow class is one such example. Kits serve as\\nlogical groupings of BeOS classes--they make it easier to categorize\\nclasses and conceptualize class relationships.\\n\\nFigure 1-2 shows that the object-oriented concept of inheritance--the ability of\\none class to inherit the functionality of another class or classes--plays a very large\\nrole in the BeOS. So too does multiple inheritance--the ability of a class to inherit\\nfrom multiple classes. In the figure, you see that almost all of the Interface Kit\\nclasses are derived from other classes, and that many of the classes inherit the contents of several classes. As one example, consider the six control classes pictured\\ntogether in a column at the far right of Figure 1-2. An object of any of these classes\\n(such as a BButton object) consists of the member functions defined in that class\\nas well as the member functions defined by all of the classes from which it is\\ndirectly and indirectly derived: the BControl, BInvoker, BView, BHandler, and\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nBRoster\\nBRoster\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nBRegion\\nBPolygon\\n\\nApplication Kit\\n\\nApplication Kit\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBWindow\\n\\nBView\\n\\nBTextView\\n\\nBAlert\\n\\nBStringView\\nBPrintJob\\n\\nBBox\\n\\nBControl\\n\\nBTextControl\\n\\nBPicture\\n\\nBColorControl\\n\\nBBitmap\\n\\nBCheckBox\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\nBScrollBar\\n\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nBScrollView\\n\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nBSeparationItem\\n\\nBButton\\nBListView\\nBMenu\\n\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\nBMenu\\n\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-2. The inheritance hierarchy for the Interface Kit\\n\\nBArchivable classes. Figure 1-3 isolates the discussed classes for emphasis of this\\npoint. This figure shows that in inheritance hierarchy figures in this book, a class\\npictured to the left of another class is higher up in the hierarchy. In Figure 1-3,\\nBView is derived from BHandler, BControl is derived from BView, and so forth.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nUnderstanding the class hierarchies of the BeOS enables you to\\nquickly determine which class or classes (and thus which member\\nfunctions) you will need to use to implement whatever behavior\\nyou\\'re adding to your program. Obviously, knowledge of the class\\nhierarchies is important. Don\\'t be discouraged, though, if the hierarchies shown in Figures 1-2 and 1-3 don\\'t make complete sense to\\nyou. This chapter only provides an overview of the object-oriented\\nnature of the BeOS. The remainder of the book fills in the details of\\nthe names, purposes, and uses of the important and commonly used\\nclasses.\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBHandler\\nBView\\nBControl\\n\\nBTextControl\\nBColorControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBPictureButton\\nBButton\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-3. The Interface Kit classes that contribute to the various control classes\\n\\nThe BControl class defines member functions that handle the needs common to\\nany type of control. For instance, a control should be able to have two states:\\nenabled or disabled. An enabled control is active, or usable by the user. A disabled control is inactive--and has a greyed-out look to let the user know it is\\nunusable. To give controls the ability to implement this behavior, the BControl\\nclass includes the SetEnabled() member function. This routine is used to enable\\nor disable a control--any kind of control. Individual types of controls will have\\nsome needs that aren\\'t common to all other types of controls and thus can\\'t be\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nimplemented by the BControl class. For example, different controls (such as buttons and checkboxes) have different looks. To make it possible for each control\\ntype to be able to draw itself, each control class defines its own constructor to initialize the control and a Draw() member function to handle the drawing of the\\ncontrol.\\n\\nNot all BeOS classes are derived from other classes--there are a few\\nclasses that don\\'t rely on inheritance. Two examples, both of which\\nhappen to be in the Interface Kit, are the BRect and BPoint classes.\\nThe BRect class is used to create objects representing rectangles. A\\nrectangle is an easily defined, two-dimensional shape that\\'s considered a basic datatype. As such, it doesn\\'t need to inherit the functionality of other classes. The BPoint class is not a derived class for\\nthe same reason.\\n\\nBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\nIn the previous section, you gained an understanding of how the BeOS is composed of numerous interrelated classes that are defined in software kits. Together\\nthese classes form an application framework from which you build your Be applications. Your program will create objects that are based on some of the BeOS\\nclasses. These objects will then communicate with one another and with the operating system itself through the use of messages. In this section, you\\'ll look at a few\\nof the most important of these classes, and you\\'ll see how they\\'re used. You\\'ll also\\nsee how messages play a role in a BeOS program. To make the transition from the\\ntheoretical to the practical, I\\'ll supply you with a few C++ snippets--as well as the\\ncode for a complete Be application. In keeping with the introductory nature of this\\nchapter, I\\'ll make this first application a trivial one.\\n\\nMessages, Threads, and Application Communication\\nEarlier in this chapter, you read that the BeOS is a multithreaded operating system. You also read that the term multithreaded isn\\'t just bandied about by BeOS\\nadvocates for no good reason--it does in fact play a key role in why the BeOS is a\\npowerful operating system. Here, you\\'ll get an introduction as to why that\\'s true.\\nIn Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, I\\'ll have a lot more to say about\\nmultithreading.\\nApplications and messages\\nA Be application begins with the creation of an object of a class type derived from\\nthe BApplication class--a class defined in the Application Kit. Figure 1-4 shows\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nhow the BApplication class fits into the inheritance hierarchy of the Application\\nKit. Creating an application object establishes the application\\'s main thread, which\\nserves as a connection between the application and the Application Server. Earlier\\nin this chapter, you read that a BeOS server is software that provides services to an\\napplication via a software kit. The Application Server takes care of many of the\\ntasks basic to any application. One such task is reporting user actions to applications. For instance, if the user clicks the mouse button or presses a key on the\\nkeyboard, the Application Server reports this information to executing applications. This information is passed in the form of a message, and is received by an\\napplication in its main thread. A message is itself an object--a parcel of data that\\nholds details about the action being reported. The ability of the operating system\\nto determine the user\\'s actions and then use a separate thread to pass detailed\\ninformation about that action to a program makes your programming job easier.\\nBRoster\\nBClipboard\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nBApplication\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nBWindow\\n\\nBMessenger\\nBMessageFiller\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBMessageQueue\\n\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-4. The inheritance hierarchy for the Application Kit\\n\\nAn application\\'s code can explicitly define BMessage objects and use them to pass\\ninformation. What I\\'ve discussed above, however, are system messages that originate from within the BeOS itself. The movement of the mouse, the pressing of a\\nkeyboard key, a mouse button click in a window\\'s close button, and a mouse button click and drag in a window\\'s resize knob are all examples of system messages. Each type of system message has a command constant associated with it.\\nThis constant names the type of event the message represents. Examples of command constants are B_KEY_DOWN, B_MOUSE_DOWN, and B_WINDOW_RESIZED.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nMessage loops and message handling\\nThe BeOS defines classes that allow the creation of objects that can work with\\nmessages. The Application Kit defines two such classes: the BLooper class and the\\nBHandler class. The BLooper class is used to create an object that exists in its\\nown thread. The purpose of this thread is to run a message loop. As messages\\nreach a message loop thread, they are placed in a queue. From this queue the\\nthread extracts and dispatches messages one after another.\\nA message is always dispatched to an object of the BHandler class. The job of the\\nBHandler object is to handle the message it receives. How it handles a message is\\ndependent on the type of message it receives.\\nAs shown back in Figure 1-4, the BLooper class is derived from the BHandler\\nclass. This means that an object of the BLooper class (or of a class derived from\\nBLooper) can have both a message loop that dispatches messages and can receive\\nthese messages itself for handling. Because the BApplication class and the\\nBWindow class are derived from the BLooper class, such is the case for the application itself and any of its windows. Just ahead you\\'ll read a little more on how an\\napplication and windows can in fact watch for and respond to messages.\\nTo summarize, a BLooper object has a thread that runs a message loop that dispatches messages, and a BHandler object receives and handles these dispatched\\nmessages. Because the BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, a\\nBLooper object can dispatch and receive and handle messages. A BHandler\\nobject can only receive and handle messages. From that description it might seem\\nthat all objects that deal with messages might as well be BLooper objects. After all,\\nthe BLooper class provides more functionality. As you read more about messaging, you\\'ll see why that path isn\\'t the one to take. Each BLooper object creates a\\nnew thread and dominates it with a message loop--the thread shouldn\\'t be used\\nfor any other purpose. A BHandler object, on the other hand, doesn\\'t create a\\nthread. While having multiple threads in a program can be advantageous, there\\'s\\nno benefit to creating threads that go unused.\\n\\nDefining and Creating Windows\\nAt the heart of the graphical user interface of the Be operating system is the window. Be applications are window-based--windows are used to accept input from\\nthe user by way of menus and controls such as buttons, and to display output to\\nthe user in the form of graphics and text. The Interface Kit--the largest of the\\nkits--exists to enable programmers to provide their Be applications with a graphical user interface that includes windows. It is classes of the Interface Kit that you\\'ll\\nbe using when you write a program that displays and works with windows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nThe BWindow class\\nAlmost all Be applications display at least one window and therefore use the\\nBWindow class--one of the dozens of classes in the Interface Kit. If you look in the\\nWindow.h header file that is a part of the set of header files used in the compilation of a Be program, you\\'ll find the declaration of the BWindow class. I\\'ve\\nincluded a partial listing (note the ellipses) of this class below. Here you can see\\nthe names of a dozen of the roughly one hundred member functions of that class.\\nLooking at the names of some of the member functions of the BWindow class gives\\nyou a good indication of the functionality the class supplies to BWindow objects.\\nclass BWindow : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nBWindow(BRect frame,\\nconst char *title,\\nwindow_type type,\\nuint32 workspace = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE);\\n...\\nvirtual\\n\\n~BWindow();\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nQuit();\\nClose();\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nheight);\\n...\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nDispatchMessage(BMessage *message, BHandler *handler);\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nFrameMoved(BPoint new_position);\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMinimize(bool minimize);\\nZoom(BPoint rec_position, float rec_width, float rec_\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\nMoveBy(float dx, float dy);\\nMoveTo(BPoint);\\nMoveTo(float x, float y);\\nResizeBy(float dx, float dy);\\nResizeTo(float width, float height);\\nShow();\\nHide();\\nIsHidden() const;\\n\\nconst char\\nvoid\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\n*Title() const;\\nSetTitle(const char *title);\\nIsFront() const;\\nIsActive() const;\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in viewing the entire BWindow class declaration,\\nyou can open the Window.h header file. The path that leads to the\\nWindow.h file will most likely be develop/headers/be/interface.\\nThere\\'s a good chance that your development environment resides\\nin your root directory, so look for the develop folder there. You can\\nopen any header file from the Edit text editor application or from the\\nBeIDE. The Metrowerks CodeWarrior BeIDE programming environment is introduced later in this chapter and discussed in more detail\\nin Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects.\\n\\nDeriving a class from BWindow\\nA Be program that uses windows could simply create window objects using the\\nBWindow class. Resulting windows would then have the impressive functionality\\nprovided by the many BWindow member functions, but they would be very\\ngeneric. That is, while they could be moved, resized, and closed (BWindow member functions take care of such tasks), they would have no properties that made\\nthem unique from the windows in any other application. Instead of simply creating a BWindow object, programs define a class derived from the BWindow class.\\nThis derived class, of course, inherits the member functions of the BWindow class.\\nAdditionally, the derived class defines new member functions and possibly overrides some inherited member functions to give the class the properties that windows of the application will need. The following snippet provides an example:\\nclass SimpleWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nSimpleWindow(BRect frame);\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nFrom the BeOS naming conventions section of this chapter, you\\nknow that the name of a class that is a part of the BeOS API (such as\\nBWindow) always starts with an uppercase \"B.\" As long as my own\\nclasses (such as SimpleWindow) don\\'t start with an uppercase \"B,\"\\nanyone reading my code will be able to quickly spot classes that are\\nof my own creation.\\n\\nThe SimpleWindow constructor\\nThe SimpleWindow class declares a constructor and one member function. The\\ndefinition of the constructor follows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\nSimpleWindow::SimpleWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"A Simple Window\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThis constructor makes use of a technique common in Be applications: the constructor for the class derived from the BWindow class invokes the BWindow class\\nconstructor. Calling the BWindow class constructor is important because the\\nBWindow constructor arguments provide important information to the window\\nobject that is to be created. In Chapter 5, Drawing, I discuss the four BWindow\\nconstructor parameters in detail. In this introduction, it will suffice for me to say\\nthat the four parameters specify the following for a newly created window object:\\n\\n\\nThe frame, or content area of the window (the size and screen placement of\\nthe window)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe name of the window (as it will appear in the window\\'s tab)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe type of the window (the look and feel of the window)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe behavior of the window (whether it has a resize knob, and so forth)\\n\\nRecall from your C++ background that when the definition of a constructor is followed by a single colon and the base class constructor,\\nthe effect is that the base class constructor gets invoked just before\\nthe body of the derived class constructor executes.\\n\\nIn this example, the BWindow constructor\\'s first argument comes from the sole\\nargument passed to the SimpleWindow constructor. A hardcoded string serves as\\nthe second argument to the BWindow constructor. The third and fourth arguments\\nare constants defined in the Window.h header file.\\nNotice that the body of the SimpleWindow constructor is empty. This tells you that\\nthe only chore of the SimpleWindow constructor is to invoke the BWindow constructor. You have to call the BWindow constructor; this function creates a new\\nwindow and spawns a new thread of execution in which the window runs, and\\nstarts up a message loop in that same thread. In a Be program, each window\\nexists in its own thread and each window is notified of system messages that\\ninvolve the window. You\\'ll be pleased to find that the work of maintaining a window\\'s thread and of keeping a window informed of system messages (such as a\\nmouse button click in the window) is taken care of by the operating system. You\\'ll\\nbe even more pleased to find that for some system messages, even the window\\'s\\nresponse to the message is handled by the BeOS. For instance, you needn\\'t write\\nany code that watches for or handles the resizing of a window.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nA window can watch for and respond to messages because the BWindow class\\ninherits from both the BLooper and BHandler classes (see Figure 1-4). A window\\nis thus a window (from BWindow), an object that includes a message loop (from\\nBLooper), and an object that responds to messages (from BHandler). This pertains to BWindow objects and, of course, objects created from classes derived from\\nthe BWindow class--such as objects of my SimpleWindow class type.\\nThe SimpleWindow QuitRequested() member function\\nThe SimpleWindow class declares one member function. Here\\'s the definition of\\nQuitRequested():\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nQuitRequested() is actually a member function of the BLooper class. Because\\nmy SimpleWindow class is derived from the BWindow class, which in turn is\\nderived from the BLooper class, this member function is inherited by the\\nSimpleWindow class. By redeclaring QuitRequested(), SimpleWindow is overriding this function.\\nIf I had opted not to override the QuitRequested() member function in the\\nSimpleWindow class, it would be the BLooper version of this function that would\\nexecute upon a user mouse button click in a window\\'s close button. Like my\\nSimpleWindow version of QuitRequested(), the version of QuitRequested()\\ndefined by the BLooper class returns a value of true. The effect is for an object\\nof BLooper type to kill the thread it is running in and delete itself. That sounds\\nmuch like what I\\'d like to do in response to the user\\'s attempt to close a window--kill the thread in which the window is running. And it is. But in my trivial\\nexample program, I\\'ll only be allowing a single window to appear on the screen.\\nWhen the user closes that window, I\\'ll want to terminate the application, not just\\nthe window. That\\'s the action I\\'ve added to the QuitRequested() function with\\nthis line of code:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\n\\nA mouse button click in a window\\'s close button generates a system message that\\ngets passed to the window. The window is a type of BLooper, so it captures messages in its message loop. A window is also a type of BHandler, so it can handle\\nthis message (as opposed to having to pass it to some other type of object for handling). It handles the message by invoking QuitRequested(). If my\\nSimpleWindow class didn\\'t override the BLooper version of this function, the\\nBLooper version would be executed and the window would close--but the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\napplication wouldn\\'t quit. That\\'s because the BLooper version only kills its own\\nthread in order to delete itself. Because SimpleWindow does override\\nQuitRequested(), it is the SimpleWindow version of this function that instead\\ngets invoked. The SimpleWindow version posts a B_QUIT_REQUESTED message to\\nthe application to tell the application to also quit. The notation used in the above\\nline (be_app->PostMessage()) is new to you, so it\\'s worthy of examination.\\nYou already know that a window is a type of BLooper, but there is another very\\nimportant type of BLooper: the application itself. An application is always represented by an application object--an object of the BApplication class that is\\ndefined in the Application Kit (refer back to Figure 1-4 if you need to verify the\\nrelationship between the BLooper class and the BWindow and BApplication\\nclasses). The PostMessage() routine is a member function of the BLooper class.\\nA BLooper object can invoke this function to place a message in the queue of its\\nown message loop.\\nAs you\\'ll see ahead, be_app is a global variable that represents the application\\nobject. This variable is always available for use by your code. The above line of\\ncode invokes the application object\\'s version of the PostMessage() function. The\\nmessage the application object places in its message loop is one that tells itself to\\nquit.\\n\\nThe variable be_app is a pointer to an object--the use of the membership access operator (->) to invoke PostMessage() tells you\\nthat. As is often the case in object-oriented programming, a pointer\\nto an object is simply referred to as the object itself. So in this book,\\nas well as in other Be documentation, you\\'ll read about the \"application object\" in discussions that include mention of be_app.\\n\\nAfter the call to PostMessage() places a request to kill the application thread in\\nthe application object\\'s message queue, the SimpleWindow version of\\nQuitRequested() returns a value of true. Remember, QuitRequested() won\\'t\\nbe called by my own code--it will be invoked by the system in response to the\\nmouse button click in a window\\'s close button. By returning a value of true,\\nQuitRequested() is telling the system that the requested service should be carried out. The system will then kill the window thread to dispose of the window.\\nPreviously I mentioned that the BeOS took care of system messages involving a\\nwindow. I gave the example of window resizing being handled by the operating\\nsystem. Yet here I\\'m discussing how my own code is being used to handle the\\nsystem message that gets generated by a click in a window\\'s close button. It\\'s\\nimportant to restate what I just discussed. It wouldn\\'t be necessary to include any\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nwindow-closing code in my SimpleWindow class if my goal was only to have a\\nmouse button click in the close button result in the closing of the window. The\\nQuitRequested() function defined in BLooper would take care of that by killing the window\\'s thread. I, however, also want the program to terminate when a\\nwindow\\'s close button is clicked. To get that extra action, I need to override\\nQuitRequested().\\nIn summary, a mouse button click in a window\\'s close box automatically causes\\nQuitRequested() to execute. If a window class doesn\\'t override this function,\\nthe window closes but the application continues to run. If the window class does\\noverride this function, what happens is determined by the code in this new version of the function. In my SimpleWindow class example, I choose to have this\\nfunction tell the application to quit and tell the window to close.\\nCreating a window object\\nDeclaring a class and defining its constructor and member functions only serves to\\nspecify how objects of this class type will look and behave--it doesn\\'t actually create any such objects. To create and display a window object you\\'ll first declare a\\nvariable that will be used to point to the object:\\nSimpleWindow\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\nBefore going ahead and allocating the memory for a new window object, your\\ncode should declare and set up a rectangle object that will serve to establish the\\nsize and screen placement of the new window:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nThe above snippet first declares and creates a rectangle object. The BRect class\\nwas briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter--it is discussed at length in\\nChapter 6, Controls and Messages. Next, the Set() member function of the BRect\\nclass is called to establish the dimensions of the rectangle. The Set() function\\'s\\nfour parameters specify the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates, respectively.\\nThe above call to Set() establishes a rectangle that will be used to create a\\nwindow with a left side 20 pixels in from the left of the screen and a top 20 pixels down from the top of the screen. While the window that will use this rectangle would seem to have a width of 180 pixels (20020) and a height of 40 pixels\\n(6020), it will actually have a width of 181 pixels and a height of 41 pixels. This\\napparent one-pixel discrepancy is explained in the screen and drawing coordinates section of Chapter 5.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nWith the window\\'s bounding rectangle established, it\\'s time to go ahead and create a new window. This line of code performs that feat:\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\n\\nTo dynamically allocate an object, use the new operator. Follow new with the constructor of the class from which the object is to be created. If you glance back at\\nthe section that describes the SimpleWindow constructor, you\\'ll be reminded that\\nthis function has one parameter--a BRect object that defines the size of the window and gets passed to the BWindow constructor.\\nAfter allocating memory for a SimpleWindow object, the system returns a pointer\\nto this memory. That pointer is stored in the aWindow variable. Until this new window is deleted, it can be accessed via this pointer. This line of code provides an\\nexample:\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nBy default, a newly created window is not visible. To display the window, your\\ncode should call the BWindow member function Show() as I\\'ve done in the above\\nline.\\nLet\\'s end this section by pulling together the code that\\'s just been introduced.\\nHere\\'s a look--with comments--at how a window is typically created in a Be\\napplication:\\nSimpleWindow\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\naRect;\\n\\n\\n// declare a pointer to a SimpleWindow\\n// object\\n// declare a rectangle object\\n\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\n\\n// specify the boundaries of the\\n// rectangle\\n// create a SimpleWindow object\\n\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\n// display the newly created window\\n\\nYou may have noticed that I used the new operator to create a window object, but\\ncreated a rectangle object without a new operator. In Be programs, objects can\\nalways be, and sometimes are, allocated dynamically. That is, the new operator is\\nused to set aside memory in the program\\'s heap--as I\\'ve done with the window.\\nSome objects, however, are allocated statically. That is, an object variable (rather\\nthan a pointer) is declared in order to set aside memory on the stack--as I chose\\nto do with the rectangle. Creating an object that resides on the stack is typically\\ndone for objects that are temporary in nature. In the above snippet, the rectangle\\nobject fits that bill--it exists only to provide values for the window\\'s dimensions.\\nAfter the creation of the window, the rectangle object is unimportant.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nIf you aren\\'t familiar with the term heap, I should explain that it is\\nan area in a program\\'s address space that exists to hold objects that\\nare created dynamically during the execution of a program. An\\nobject can be added or deleted from the heap without regard for its\\nplacement in the heap, or for the other contents of the heap. The\\nstack, on the other hand, is used to store objects in a set order--\\nobjects are stacked one atop the other. Objects can only be added\\nand removed from the top of the stack.\\n\\nDefining an Application\\nEvery Be program must create an object that represents the application itself. This\\none object is the first one created when a program launches and the last one\\ndeleted when the program quits. One of the primary purposes of the application\\nobject is to make and maintain a connection with the Application Server. It is the\\nApplication Server that takes care of the low-level work such as handling interactions between windows and monitoring input from data entry sources such as the\\nkeyboard and mouse.\\nThe BApplication class\\nTo create the application object, you first define a class that is derived from the\\nBApplication class and then create a single instance of that class (an instance\\nbeing nothing more than another name for an object). From the Application.h\\nheader file, here\\'s a partial listing of the BApplication class:\\nclass BApplication : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n...\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\n\\nBApplication(const char * signature);\\n~BApplication();\\nthread_id\\nvoid\\n\\nRun();\\nQuit();\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nShowCursor();\\nHideCursor();\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\nReferring back to Figure 1-4, you can see that the BApplication class is both a\\ntype of BLooper and a type of BHandler. This means that an application object is\\ncapable of having a message loop, and is capable of handling messages in that\\nloop. As it turns out, the application object runs the application\\'s main message\\nloop. It is this loop that receives messages that affect the application.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nDeriving a class from BApplication\\nEvery application defines a single class derived from the BApplication class. A\\nprogram that will be communicating with other programs may define a number of\\nmember functions to handle this interapplication communication. A simpler application might define nothing more than a constructor, as shown here:\\nclass SimpleApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nSimpleApplication();\\n};\\n\\nThe SimpleApplication constructor\\nWhen a Be program starts, it\\'s common practice for the program to open a single\\nwindow without any help from the user. Because the SimpleApplication()\\nconstructor executes at program launch (that\\'s when the application object is created), it would make sense to let this constructor handle the job of creating and\\ndisplaying a window. Here\\'s a look at how the constructor does that:\\nSimpleApplication::SimpleApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-simpleapp\")\\n{\\nSimpleWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nJust as my SimpleWindow class invoked the constructor of the class it was derived\\nfrom (the BWindow class), so does my SimpleApplication class invoke the constructor of the class it is derived from (the BApplication class). Invoking the\\nBApplication constructor is necessary for a few reasons. The BApplication\\nconstructor:\\n\\n\\nConnects the application to the Application Server\\n\\n\\n\\nProvides the application with a unique identifying signature for the program\\n\\n\\n\\nSets the global variable be_app to point to the new application object\\n\\nThe connecting of an application to the Application Server has already been mentioned. This connection allows the server to send messages to the application. The\\napplication signature is a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) string. The\\nphrase application/x-vnd. should lead off the signature. Any characters you want\\ncan follow the period, but convention states that this part of the MIME string consist of an abbreviation of your company\\'s name, a hyphen, and then part or all of\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nthe program name. In the above example, I\\'ve used my initials (dps) as the company name. I\\'ve elected to name my program SimpleApp, so the MIME string ends\\nwith simpleapp. The assignment of an application\\'s signature is described at\\ngreater length in Chapter 2. The global variable be_app was introduced in the earlier discussion of windows. This variable, which is always available for your program\\'s use, always points to your program\\'s BApplication object.\\nIn the \"Creating a window object\" section that appears earlier, you saw five lines\\nof code that demonstrated how a window object could be created and how its\\nwindow could be displayed on the screen. If you compare the body of the\\nSimpleApplication() constructor to those five lines, you\\'ll see that they are\\nidentical.\\nCreating an application object\\nAfter defining a class derived from the BApplication class, it\\'s time to create an\\napplication object of that class type. You can create such an object dynamically by\\ndeclaring a pointer to the class type, then using the new operator to do the following: allocate memory, invoke a constructor, and return a pointer to the allocated\\nmemory. Here\\'s how that\\'s done:\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\n*myApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication = new SimpleApplication();\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, myApplication can be used to invoke any of the\\nmember functions of the BApplication class (from which the\\nSimpleApplication class is derived). In particular, soon after creating an application object, your Be program will invoke the BApplication Run() member\\nfunction:\\nmyApplication->Run();\\n\\nThe Run() function kicks off the message loop in the application\\'s main thread,\\nand then it begins processing messages. Not only is a call to this function important, it\\'s necessary; an application won\\'t start running until Run() is invoked.\\nA program\\'s application object is typically declared in main(), and is accessed by\\nthe global variable be_app outside of main(). So there\\'s really no need to have\\nthe application object reside in the heap--it can be on the stack. Here\\'s how the\\ncreation of the application object looks when done using a variable local to\\nmain():\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run ();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nThis second technique is the way the application object will be created in this\\nbook, but you should be aware that you may encounter code that uses the first\\ntechnique.\\n\\nThe main() Routine\\nThe preceding pages introduced the C++ code you\\'ll write to create an application object and start an application running. One important question remains to be\\nanswered, though: where does this code go? Because the application object must\\nbe created immediately upon application launch (to establish a connection to the\\nApplication Server), it should be obvious that this code must appear very early in\\nthe program. A C++ program always begins its execution at the start of a routine\\nnamed main(), so it shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that it is in main() that you\\'ll\\nfind the above code. Here\\'s a look at a main() routine that is typical of a simple\\nBe application:\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nTo start a program, call Run(). When the user quits the program, Run() completes executing and the program ends. You\\'ll notice in the above snippet that\\nbetween Run() and return, there is no code. Yet the program won\\'t start and\\nthen immediately end. Here\\'s why. The creation of the application object (via the\\ndeclaration of the BApplication-derived object myApplication) initiates the\\nprogram\\'s main thread. When Run() is then called, the Run() function takes control of this main application thread. Run() sets up the main message loop in this\\nmain thread, and controls the loop and thread until the program terminates. That\\nis, once called, Run() executes until the program ends.\\n\\nThe SimpleApp Example Program\\nThe preceding pages have supplied you with all the code you need to write a Be\\napplication--albeit a very simple one. Because this same code (or slight variations\\nof it) will appear as a part of the source code for every Be program you write, I\\'ve\\ngone to great lengths to explain its purpose. In trying to make things perfectly\\nclear, I\\'ll admit that I\\'ve been a bit verbose--I\\'ve managed to take a relatively\\nsmall amount of starter code and spread it out over several pages. To return your\\nfocus to just how little code is needed to get a Be program started, I\\'ve packaged\\nthe preceding snippets into a single source code listing. When compiled and\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nlinked, this source code becomes an executable named SimpleApp. When\\nlaunched, the SimpleApp program displays a single, empty window like the one\\nshown in Figure 1-5.\\n\\nFigure 1-5. The window that results from running the SimpleApp program\\n\\nThe SimpleApp source code listing\\nPresented next, in its entirety, is the source code for a Be application named SimpleApp. As mentioned, all of the code you\\'re about to see has been presented and\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter.\\n#include <Window.h>\\n#include <Application.h>\\nclass SimpleWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nSimpleWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n};\\n\\nSimpleWindow::SimpleWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"A Simple Window\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nclass SimpleApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nSimpleApplication();\\n};\\n\\nSimpleApplication::SimpleApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-simpleapp\")\\n{\\nSimpleWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nmain()\\n{\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nWhat the SimpleApp program does\\nWhen you launch SimpleApp you\\'ll see the window pictured in Figure 1-5. You\\ncan click the mouse button while the cursor is positioned over the zoom button in\\nthe window\\'s tab to expand the window to a size that fills most of your monitor.\\nClick the mouse button with the cursor again positioned over the window\\'s zoom\\nbutton and the window will return to its previous, much smaller, size. If you click\\nand hold the mouse button while the cursor is positioned over the window\\'s tab,\\nyou can drag the window about the monitor. Most important to this discussion is\\nthat the SimpleApp source code includes no code to handle such tasks. The zooming and moving of windows is handled by the system, not by the SimpleApp code.\\nThis simple demonstration emphasizes the power of the BeOS system software--it\\nis the system software code (rather than the application code) that supplies much\\nof the functionality of a program.\\nWhat the SimpleApp program doesn\\'t do\\nThere are a number of things SimpleApp doesn\\'t do--things you\\'d expect a \"real\"\\nBe application to do. Most notable of these omissions are menus, support of input\\nby way of controls in the window, and support of output via drawing or writing to\\nthe window. Of course these omissions will be rectified in the balance of this\\nbook. Starting, in fact, with the next chapter.\\n\\nBeOS Programming Environment\\nThe programming tool you\\'ll be using to create your Be applications is the BeIDE.\\nThis piece of software is an integrated development environment (IDE) and it runs\\non the Be operating system (so the origin of the name BeIDE is pretty evident!).\\nThe development of a new program entails the creation of a number of files\\nwhich, collectively, are often referred to as a project. Taking a look at an existing\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Environment\\n\\n\\nproject is a good way to get an overview of the files that make up a project, and is\\nalso of benefit in understanding how these same files integrate with one another.\\nIn Chapter 2 I do just that. There you\\'ll see the HelloWorld example that\\'s the\\nmainstay of getting introduced to a new programming language or platform. In\\nthat chapter, you\\'ll also see how an existing project (such as HelloWorld) can be\\nused as the basis for an entirely new program. As a prelude to Chapter 2\\'s indepth coverage of this project, take a look at Figures 1-6 and 1-7.\\n\\nFigure 1-6. The files used in the development of the HelloWorld application\\n\\nThe /boot/apps/Metrowerks folder holds the BeIDE itself, along with other folders\\nthat hold supporting files and projects. Figure 1-6 shows the contents of a folder\\nthat holds two projects, both of which are used for building a standalone HelloWorld application. The project named HelloWorld_ppc.proj is used to build a Be\\napplication that executes on a PowerPC-based machine running the BeOS, while\\nthe project named HelloWorld_x86.proj is used to build a Be application that executes on an Intel-based PC. In Figure 1-6 you see that a project consists of a number of files. The filename extensions provide a hint of the types of files that make\\nup any one project. A file with an extension of:\\n.cpp\\nIs a C++ source code file\\n.h Is a header file that holds definitions used by certain C++ source code files\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\n.rsrc\\nIs a resource file that holds resources that get merged with compiled source\\ncode\\n.proj\\nIs a project file that is used to organize the files used by the project\\nAlso shown in the HelloWorld folder in Figure 1-6 is a makefile--appropriately\\nnamed makefile. The BeIDE programming environment supports creation of programs from the command line. That is, you can supply the BeIDE compiler and\\nlinker with information by editing a makefile and then running that file from the\\nBeOS Terminal application. In this book I\\'ll forego the command-line approach to\\napplication development and instead rely on the BeIDE\\'s project-based model. As\\nyou\\'ll see in Chapter 2, creating a project file to serve as a means of organizing the\\nfiles used in a project takes full advantage of the Be graphical user interface.\\nFigure 1-7 shows the window that appears when you use the BeIDE to open the\\nproject file for the HelloWorld project.\\n\\nFigure 1-7. The project window for the HelloWorld project\\n\\nYou use a project file as a sort of command center for one project. From this one\\nwindow, you add and remove source code files, libraries, and resource files from\\nthe project. You can also double-click on a source code filename in the project\\nwindow to open, and then edit, that file. Using menu items from the File, Project,\\nand Window menus in the menubar of the project window, you can perform a\\nmyriad of commands--including compiling source code and building an application.\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Development\\nEnvironment File\\nOrganization\\n Examining an\\nExisting BeIDE\\nProject\\n Setting Up a New\\nBeIDE Project\\n HelloWorld Source\\nCode\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBeIDE Projects\\n\\nThe BeOS CD-ROM includes the BeIDE--Be\\'s integrated development environment (IDE) that\\'s used for creating Be applications. This programming environment consists of a number of folders and files, the most important of which are\\nmentioned in this chapter. In the early stages of your Be programming studies, the\\nfolder of perhaps the most interest is the one that holds sample code. Within this\\nfolder are a number of other folders, each holding a Be-supplied project. A project\\nis a collection of files that, when compiled, results in a single Be application. The\\nbest way to understand just what a project consists of is to take a long look at an\\nexisting Be project. That\\'s exactly what I do in this chapter.\\nAfter examining an existing project, you\\'ll of course want to create your own. A\\nlarge part of this chapter is devoted to the steps involved in doing that. Here you\\'ll\\nsee how to organize classes into header files and source code files, and how the\\nresource file fits into the scheme of things.\\n\\nDevelopment Environment File\\nOrganization\\nYou\\'ll find that an overview of how the many BeIDE items are organized will be\\nbeneficial as you look at existing BeIDE example projects and as you then start to\\nwrite your own BeOS program.\\n\\nThe BeIDE Folders\\nWhen the BeIDE is installed on your hard drive, the folders and files that make up\\nthis programming environment end up in a pair of folders named develop and\\napps on your boot drive.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nThe /boot/develop folder\\nIn the develop folder you\\'ll find folders that hold header files, libraries, and developer tools. Figure 2-1 shows the contents of the develop folder (on a PowerPCbased machine--a BeOS installation on an Intel-based machine results in one\\nadditional folder, the tools folder). This figure also shows the apps folder. The apps\\nfolder holds over a dozen items, though in Figure 2-1 you just see a single item\\n(the Metrowerks folder, discussed later).\\n\\nFigure 2-1. Some of the key folders and files used in BeOS programming\\n\\nIn the develop folder the lib folder holds a number of library files that can be\\nlinked to your own compiled code. The act of creating a BeIDE project (discussed\\nlater) automatically handles the adding of the basic libraries (libroot.so and libbe.so\\nat this writing) to the project. As a novice Be programmer, this automatic adding\\nof libraries to a new project is beneficial--it shields you from having to know the\\ndetails of the purpose of each library. As you become proficient at programming\\nfor the BeOS, though, you\\'ll be writing code that makes use of classes not\\nincluded in the basic libraries--so you\\'ll want to know more about the libraries\\nincluded in the develop/lib folder. Of course you could simply add libraries wholesale to a project to \"play it safe,\" but that tack would be a poor one--especially for\\nprogrammers developing BeOS applications that are to run on Intel machines. On\\nIntel, all libraries in a project will likely be linked during the building of an application--even if the program uses no code from one or more of the project\\'s libraries. The resulting application will then be unnecessarily large, or will include\\ndependencies on libraries that are not needed.\\nThe develop folder headers holds the header files that provide the BeIDE compiler\\nwith an interface to the software kits. Within the headers folder is a folder named\\nbe. Within that folder you\\'ll find one folder for each software kit. In any one of\\nthese folders are individual header files, each defining a class that is a part of one\\n\\x0cDevelopment Environment File Organization\\n\\n\\nkit. For instance, the BWindow class is declared in the Window.h header file in the\\ninterface folder. The complete path to that file is /boot/develop/headers/be/interface/Window.h.\\nThe etc folder in the develop folder contains additional developer tools. As of this\\nwriting, the primary component in this folder is files used by programmers who\\nprefer a makefile alternative to BeIDE projects. To build an application without\\ncreating a BeIDE project, copy the makefile template file from this folder to the\\nfolder that holds your source code files. Then edit the copied makefile to include\\nthe names of the files to compile and link. In this book, I\\'ll focus on the BeIDE\\nproject model, rather than the makefile approach, for creating an application.\\nThe tools folder in the develop folder is found only on Intel versions of the BeOS.\\nThis folder contains the x86 (Intel) compiling and linking tools and the debugger.\\nThe /boot/apps/Metrowerks folder\\nOf most interest in the /boot/apps folder is the Metrowerks folder. The BeIDE was\\noriginally an integrated development environment that was created and distributed by a company named Metrowerks. Be, Inc. has since taken over development and distribution of the BeIDE. Though Be now owns the BeIDE, installation\\nof the environment still ends up in a folder bearing Metrowerks\\' name.\\nIn the Metrowerks folder can be found the BeIDE application itself. The BeIDE is\\nthe Be integrated development environment--to develop an application, you\\nlaunch the BeIDE and then create a new project or open an existing one.\\nAlso in the Metrowerks folder are a number of subdirectories that hold various supporting files and tools. The plugins folder holds BeIDE plugins that enhance the\\ncapabilities of the BeIDE. The stationery folder contains the basic stationery used\\nin the creation of a new BeIDE project (stationery being a file that tells the BeIDE\\nwhich files (such as which libraries) to include, and what compiler and linker settings to use in a new project). The tools folder contains the compiler and linker\\n(on the PowerPC version of the BeOS) or links to the compiler and linker (on the\\nIntel version of the BeOS). On the PowerPC version of the BeOS, you\\'ll find a\\ncouple of other folders in the Metrowerks folder: the debugger folder (which holds\\nthe PowerPC debugger, of course) and the profiling folder (which holds some\\nPowerPC profiling tools).\\nThe sample-code folder\\nIncluded on the BeOS CD-ROM, but not automatically placed on your hard drive\\nduring the installation of the BeOS, is the sample-code folder. If you elected to\\nhave optional items included during the BeOS installation, this folder may be on\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nyour hard drive. Otherwise, look in the optional folder on the BeOS CD-ROM for\\nthe sample-code folder and manually copy it to your hard drive.\\nThe sample-code folder holds a number of Be-provided projects. Each project,\\nalong with the associated project files, is kept in its own folder. A Be application\\nstarts out as a number of files, including source code files, header files, and a\\nresource file (I have much more to say about each of these file types throughout\\nthis chapter).\\n\\nExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\nThe development of a new program entails the creation of a number of files collectively called a project. Taking a look at an existing project is a good way to get\\nan overview of the files that make up a project, and is also of benefit in understanding how these same files integrate with one another. Because my intent here\\nis to provide an overview of what a project consists of (as opposed to exploring\\nthe useful and exciting things that can be accomplished via the code within the\\nfiles of a project), I\\'ll stick to staid and familiar ground. On the next several pages\\nI look at the HelloWorld project.\\nYou\\'ve certainly encountered a version of the HelloWorld program--regardless of\\nyour programming background. The Be incarnation of the HelloWorld application\\nperforms as expected--the phrase \"Hello, World!\" is written to a window.\\nFigure 2-2 shows what is displayed on your screen when the HelloWorld program\\nis launched.\\n\\nFigure 2-2. The window displayed by the HelloWorld program\\n\\nYou may encounter a number of versions of the HelloWorld project--there\\'s one\\nin the sample-code folder, and you may uncover other incarnations on Be CDROMs or on the Internet. So that you can follow along with me, you might want to\\nuse the version I selected--it\\'s located in its own folder in the Chapter 2 folder of\\nexample projects. Figure 2-3 shows the contents of this book\\'s version of the HelloWorld folder.\\nAs shown in Figure 2-3, when developing a new application, the general practice\\nis to keep all of the project\\'s files in a single folder. To organize your own\\nprojects, you may want to create a new folder with a catchy name such as\\nmyProjects and store it in the /boot/home folder--as I\\'ve done in Figure 2-3. To\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-3. The files used in the development of a Be application\\n\\nbegin experimenting, you can copy this book\\'s HelloWorld example folder to your\\nown project folder. That way you\\'re sure to preserve the original, working version\\nof this example.\\n\\nProject File\\nA Be application developed using the BeIDE starts out as a project file. A project\\nfile groups and organizes the files that hold the code used for one project. By convention, a project file\\'s name has an extension of .proj. It\\'s general practice to give\\nthe project file the same name the application will have, with the addition of an\\nunderscore and then ppc for a PowerPC-based project or an underscore and then\\nx86 for an Intel-based project. In Figure 2-3, you can see that for the HelloWorld\\nproject there are two versions of the project file: HelloWorld_ppc.proj and\\nHelloWorld_x86.proj.\\nTo open a project file, you can either double-click on its icon or start the BeIDE\\napplication and choose Open from the File menu. In either case, select the project\\nthat\\'s appropriate for the platform you\\'re working on. When a project file is\\nopened, its contents are displayed in a project window. As shown in Figure 2-4, a\\nproject window\\'s contents consist of a list of files.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFigure 2-4. The project window for the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld project\\n\\nThe files listed in a project window are the files to be compiled and linked\\ntogether to form a single executable. This can be a combination of any number of\\nsource code, resource, and library files. The HelloWorld project window holds\\nthree source code files and one resource file, each of which is discussed in this\\nchapter. The project window also lists one or more libraries. The number of libraries varies depending on whether you\\'re working on a PowerPC version or an Intel\\nversion of a project. Figure 2-4 shows the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld\\nproject. In this project, the glue-noinit.a, init_term_dyn.o, and start_dyn.o libraries collectively make up the Be runtime support library that handles the dynamic\\nlinking code used by any Be application. An Intel project doesn\\'t list these libraries--they\\'re linked in automatically. The libroot.so library handles library management, all of the Kernel Kit, and the standard C library. The libnet.so library handles networking, while the libbe.so library is a shared library that contains the C++\\nclasses and the global C functions that encompass many of the other kits. An Intel\\nproject lists only the libbe.so library--the other two libraries are always automatically linked in. The Be kits hold the software that make up much of the BeOS, so\\nthis library is a part of the Be operating system rather than a file included with the\\nBeIDE environment.\\n\\nLibrary filenames will be prefaced with an indicator as to the\\nproject\\'s target platform (the platform on which the resulting application is to run). Figure 2-4 shows a project targeted for the PowerPC\\n(Power Macintosh or BeBox) platform.\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nProject activity is controlled from the Project menu located in the project window\\nmenubar. In Figure 2-5, you see that this menu is used to add files to and remove\\nfiles from a project. From this menu, you can compile a single file, build an application, and give a built application a test run. In the \"Setting Up a New BeIDE\\nProject\" section, you\\'ll make use of several of the menu items in the Project menu.\\n\\nFigure 2-5. The Project menu in the menubar of a BeIDE project window\\n\\nOf the many items in the Project menu, the Run/Debug item is the most important. Figure 2-5 shows that this bottom menu item is named Run--but this same\\nitem can instead take on the name Debug. When the menu item just above this\\none says Enable Debugger, then the Run/Debug item is in the Run mode. When\\nthe menu item just above instead says Disable Debugger, then the Run/Debug\\nitem is in the Debug mode. In either case, choosing Run or Debug causes all of\\nthe following to happen:\\n\\n\\nCompile all project files that have been changed since the last compilation\\n(which may be none, some, or all of the files in the project)\\n\\n\\n\\nLink together the resulting object code\\n\\n\\n\\nMerge the resource code from any resource files to the linked object code to\\nmake (build) an executable (an application)\\n\\n\\n\\nLaunch the resulting application in order for you to test it (if no compile or\\nlink errors occurred)\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nIf the Run/Debug menu is in Debug mode, then the last step in the above list\\ntakes place in the debugger. That is, the application is launched in the appropriate debugger (MWDebug-Be for PowerPC projects and bdb for Intel projects).\\nMany of the other items in the Project menu carry out a subset of the operations\\nthat are collectively performed by the Run/Debug item.\\nIf you haven\\'t compiled any Be source code yet, go ahead and give it a try now.\\nOpen the HelloWorld project file. To avoid the debugger during this first test,\\nmake sure the Project menu item just above the Run/Debug item says Enable\\nDebugger (select the item if it doesn\\'t say that). Now choose Run from the Project\\nmenu to compile the project\\'s code and run the resulting HelloWorld application.\\n\\nSource Code and Header Files\\nThe BeOS is a C++ application framework, so your source code will be written in\\nC++ and saved in source code files that have an extension of .cpp. To open an\\nexisting source code file that is a part of a project, double-click on the file\\'s name\\nin the project window. That\\'s what I did for the HelloWorld.cpp file that\\'s part of\\nthe HelloWorld project--the result is shown in Figure 2-6.\\n\\nFigure 2-6. The source code window for the HelloWorld.cpp source code file\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nMost of your code will be kept in source code files. Code that might be common\\nto more than one file may be saved to a header file with an extension of .h. While\\nyou can keep a project\\'s code in as few or as many source code and header files\\nas desired, you\\'ll want to follow the way Be does things in its examples.\\nProject file organization convention\\nBe example projects organize source code into files corresponding to a convention that\\'s common in object-oriented programming. The declaration, or specifier,\\nof an application-defined class exists in its own header file. The definitions, or\\nimplementations, of the member functions of this class are saved together in a single source code file. Both the header file and the source code file have the same\\nname as the class, with respective extensions of .h and .cpp.\\nThere\\'s one notable exception to this naming convention. A project usually\\nincludes a header file and source code file with the same name as the project (and\\nthus the same name as the application that will be built from the project). The\\nheader file holds the definition of the class derived from the BApplication class.\\nThe source code file holds the implementations of the member functions of this\\nBApplication-derived class, as well as the main() function.\\nFile organization and the HelloWorld project\\nNow let\\'s take a look at the HelloWorld project to see if it follows the above convention. Because this example is based on a project from Be, Inc., you can guess\\nthat it does, but you\\'ll want to bear with me just the same. The point here isn\\'t to\\nsee if the HelloWorld project follows the described system of organizing files, it\\'s\\nto examine an existing project to clarify the class/file relationship.\\nBack in Figure 2-4 you saw that the HelloWorld project window displays the\\nnames of three source code files: HelloView.cpp, HelloWindow.cpp, and HelloWorld.cpp. While it\\'s not obvious from the project window, there is also a\\nheader file that corresponds to each of these source code files (opening a source\\ncode file and looking at its #include directives reveals that information). According to the previous discussion, you\\'d expect that the HelloView.h file holds a listing for a class named HelloView. Here\\'s the code from that file:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloView.h\\nclass HelloView: public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nLooking at the code in the HelloView.cpp file, we\\'d expect to see the implementations of the three member functions declared in the HelloView class definition.\\nAnd we do:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloView.cpp\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAs you can see from the HelloView.cpp listing, I\\'m saving a little ink by not showing all of the code in the project\\'s files. Nor do I describe the code I do show.\\nHere I\\'m only interested in demonstrating the relationship between a project\\'s files\\nand the classes defined by that project. I do, however, take care of both of those\\nomissions at the end of this chapter in the \"HelloWorld Source Code\" section.\\n\\nI said I wouldn\\'t discuss the HelloWorld source code here. Out of\\ndecency to the very curious, though, I will make a few quick comments. You\\'re familiar with the SimpleApp example that was introduced in Chapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview. That example\\ndefined two classes. One was named SimpleWindow and was\\nderived from the BWindow class. It was used to display a window.\\nThe second class was named SimpleApplication and was derived\\nfrom the BApplication class. Every Be program needs to define\\nsuch a class. The HelloWorld example discussed here defines similar classes named HelloWindow and HelloApplication. It also\\ndefines a third class named HelloView, which is derived from the\\nBView class. Before writing or drawing to a window, a program\\nmust define a view--an area in the window to which drawing\\nshould be directed. The SimpleApp program didn\\'t draw to its window, so it didn\\'t need a class derived from the BView class.\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe second source code file shown in the project window in Figure 2-4 is HelloWindow.cpp. This file has a corresponding header file named HelloWindow.h. In\\nthis file we expect to find the declaration of a class named HelloWindow--and we\\ndo:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWindow.h\\nclass HelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nThe HelloWindow.cpp file contains the source code for the two HelloWindow\\nmember functions, HelloWindow() and QuitRequested():\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWindow.cpp\\n#include \"HelloWindow.h\"\\nHelloWindow::HelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW,\\nB_NOT_RESIZABLE | B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\nbool HelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nEarlier I stated that the header file that bears the name of the project should hold\\nthe declaration of the project\\'s application class--the class derived from the\\nBApplication class. Here you see that the HelloWorld.h header file does indeed\\nhold this declaration:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWorld.h\\nclass HelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nHelloApplication();\\n};\\n\\nThe source code file with the name of the project should hold the code for the\\nimplementation of the member functions of the application class as well as the\\nmain() function. HelloWorld.cpp does hold the following code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWorld.cpp\\n#include \"HelloWindow.h\"\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#include \"HelloWorld.h\"\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\n...\\n...\\n\\n}\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nWhile I omitted the code that makes up the body of each member function of\\neach class in the HelloWorld project, you may still have picked up on similarities\\nbetween the HelloWorld source code and the source code of the Chapter 1 example, SimpleApp. In the section \"HelloWorld Source Code\" I point out all of the\\nsimilarities and discuss the differences.\\n\\nIn looking at existing source code, you may encounter a\\nBApplication constructor argument that\\'s four characters between\\nsingle quotes rather than a long, double-quoted MIME string. The\\nfour-character method is the old way of supplying a signature to an\\napplication, and is dated. The newer MIME string format is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\\n\\nResources and the Resource File\\nIt\\'s nice to sum up a programming concept in a single sentence, as in \"a pointer is\\na reference to a specific area in memory.\" Unfortunately, such conciseness isn\\'t\\nalways possible. Such is the case with the subject of resources. I\\'ll begin with a\\nshort summation--\"a resource is code that represents one element of a program\"--but adding clarity to that vague explanation necessitates a couple of paragraphs.\\nThe \"element of a program\" I speak of is usually thought of as one part, or entity,\\nof a program\\'s graphical user interface. For instance, some operating systems make\\nit easy to represent a window or menu as a resource. But a resource doesn\\'t have\\nto represent something graphical. For instance, an application\\'s signature--a short,\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nunique string that helps the operating system differentiate the application from all\\nother applications--is anything but graphical. Yet it can be a resource. While an\\napplication\\'s signature isn\\'t graphical in nature, the way in which it can be created\\nand edited can be thought of as graphical. For instance, one could imagine a simple editor that had a Create Application Signature menu item which, when\\nselected, displayed a text box in which a short string was typed. The editor would\\nthen be responsible for saving these typed characters as a resource. So it turns out\\nthat rather than representing something that is itself graphical, a resource is usually something that can be created and edited graphically.\\nBeing graphically editable is typically one trait that makes an element a candidate\\nto be represented by a resource. Since some programmer will have to design a\\nspecial editor that is capable of graphically editing a resource, another requirement is that the element be something common to most or all programs.\\nYou\\'ve just read that different program elements exist as resources for a variety of\\nreasons. An application\\'s icon is a good example. First, an icon is a small picture,\\nso it of course is an entity that lends itself to being easily edited graphically. Second, all applications have an icon that is used to represent the application on the\\ndesktop, so it made sense for someone to expend the effort to create an editor\\ncapable of editing icons. Finally, the BeOS needs the data that defines an application\\'s icon even when the application isn\\'t running, so that it can display the icon\\non the desktop at all times.\\nThere are different types of resources, and the BeOS keeps track of these different\\ntypes by using a different 32-bit integer for each resource type. As a convenience\\nto programmers, a four-character constant is often used to define this integer. Consider the icon that represents an application on the desktop. The data that defines\\nthis icon exists as a resource, and its type is `ICON.\\' Most programmers find it easier to remember the four-character constant `ICON\\' than the numerical value this\\nconstant represents.\\n\\nWhile a resource type is surrounded in single quotes in this book\\nand in Be documentation as well, the quotes aren\\'t a part of the\\nresource type--a resource type is simply the four characters (or an\\nactual 32-bit numerical value). The quotes are used only to make it\\nobvious that a resource type is being discussed. This is important\\nbecause a resource type can be in lowercase, and it can include a\\nspace or spaces. Placing an icon type in quotes sets it apart from the\\nrest of the text that appears with it.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nApplication-information resource\\nThere\\'s one other reason that a certain part of a program will exist as a resource--\\na reason unrelated to the graphical nature of the element or its ability to be edited\\ngraphically. Because of the way in which resources are stored in an executable,\\nresource information is available to the BeOS even when the application isn\\'t\\nrunning. The BeOS needs some information about an application in order to\\nbe able to effectively communicate with it. This information can be kept together\\nin a single resource of type `APPI\\' (for \"application information\") in the application. An `APPI\\' resource consists of the following pieces of information about an\\napplication:\\nLaunch Behavior\\nThe launch characteristics of a Be application can fall into one of three categories. Single launch is the typical behavior--no matter how many times a user\\ndouble-clicks on the application\\'s icon, only one instance of the executable is\\nloaded into memory and executed (that is, double-clicking on an application\\'s\\nicon a second time has no effect). It\\'s possible for two versions of a single\\nlaunch application to end up in memory if the user makes a duplicate of the\\noriginal executable and then double-clicks on each. Exclusive launch is a\\nbehavior that restricts this from occurring. Under no circumstance can two versions of a program execute at the same time. Multiple launch is a behavior\\nthat allows any number of instances of a single copy of a program to execute\\nsimultaneously.\\nBackground App\\nAn application can forego a user interface and run in the background only. If\\nan application is marked as a background app, it behaves in this way and\\nwon\\'t be named in the Deskbar.\\nArgv Only\\nAn application can be excluded from receiving messages from the BeOS (refer\\nto Chapter 1 for an introduction to messages). Marking an application as argv\\nonly means that the only information the application receives comes from the\\nargc and argv command-line arguments that can be optionally passed to the\\nprogram\\'s main() routine.\\nSignature\\nEach application has a string that lets the BeOS view the application as unique\\nfrom all others. Obviously, no two applications should share the same signature. For your own test programs, the signature you choose isn\\'t too important. Should you decide to distribute one of your applications to the Be community, though, you\\'ll want to put a little effort into selecting a signature. Be\\'s\\nrecommended format is \"application/x-vnd.VendorName-ApplicationName\".\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nReplacing VendorName with your company\\'s name should provide a unique\\nsignature for your application.\\nHere I\\'ll look at `APPI\\' information for an existing project that already includes a\\nresource file. In this chapter\\'s \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section you\\'ll find\\ninformation on creating a resource file and editing its `APPI\\' information. To view\\nthe `APPI\\' information in a project\\'s resource file, double-click on its name in the\\nproject window. That launches the FileTypes application (which can also be\\nlaunched by choosing it from the preferences folder in the Be menu) and opens\\ntwo windows. Figure 2-7 shows the main window of FileTypes.\\n\\nFigure 2-7. The main FileTypes window\\n\\nTo view or edit an application\\'s `APPI\\' resource information, work in the second of\\nFileTypes\\' two windows. Figure 2-8 shows this window for the HelloWorld application.\\nThe application\\'s launch behavior is determined based on which of the three\\nLaunch radio buttons is on--Single Launch, Multiple Launch, or Exclusive Launch\\n(only one can be on at any given time).\\nWhether or not the application is a background app is determined by the status of\\nthe Background App checkbox. Whether or not the application is capable of\\nreceiving messages is determined by the status of the Argv Only checkbox. While\\nthese two items appear grouped together in the Application Flags area, they aren\\'t\\nrelated. Neither, either, or both can be checked at the same time.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFigure 2-8. Viewing the `APPI\\' information for the HelloWorld application\\n\\nAn application\\'s signature is based on the MIME string you enter in the signature\\nedit box of the FileTypes window. If a signature appears here, the string passed to\\nthe BApplication constructor will be ignored (refer to Chapter 1). If no signature appears here, the string passed to the BApplication constructor will be\\nused. Thus, by entering a string in the FileTypes window, you\\'re making the\\nBApplication constructor argument immaterial. Figure 2-8 shows the signature\\nfor the HelloWorld application used throughout this chapter.\\nIf you make any changes to a project\\'s resource file, save them by choosing Save\\nfrom the File menu of FileTypes (the File menu\\'s other item, Save into Resource\\nFile, is discussed in the \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section of this chapter).\\nIcon resource\\nAn icon could be described within source code (and, in the \"old days,\" that was in\\nfact how icons were described), but the specification of individual pixel colors in\\nsource code is difficult and tedious work. Rather than attempting to specify the\\ncolors of each pixel of an icon from within source code, a BeOS application\\'s icon\\ncan be created using a special graphical editor built into the FileTypes application.\\nThe graphical editor in FileTypes is used in a manner similar to the way you use a\\ngraphics paint program--you select a color from a palette of colors and then use a\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\npencil tool to click on individual pixels to designate that they take on that color.\\nSee Figure 2-9 to get an idea of what the graphical editor in FileTypes looks like.\\n\\nFigure 2-9. The icon editing window and palettes displayed by FileTypes\\n\\nIn FileTypes you simply draw the icon. You can then save the icon to a project\\'s\\nresource file so that each time an application is built from the project, your icon is\\nmerged with the application (and becomes the icon viewed on the desktop by the\\nuser). To view or edit the icon stored in the resource file of an existing project,\\nyou first double-click on the resource filename in the project window to open the\\nresource file. After FileTypes opens the resource file, double-click on the small\\nicon box located at the upper right of the FileTypes window; you\\'ll see the window shown in Figure 2-9.\\n\\nSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\nIn the previous section, you read that an application starts as a Be project. The Be\\nproject consists of a project file, source code files, header files, libraries, and\\na resource file. The project file itself doesn\\'t hold any code; it serves as a means to\\norganize all the other files in the project. The project file also serves as the project\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\n\"command center\" from which you compile code and build and test the executable. A close look at the HelloWorld project clarified many of these concepts.\\nWhen you set out to develop your own application, you\\'ll find that you may be\\nable to save some effort if you don\\'t start from scratch, but instead duplicate a\\nfolder that holds the files of an existing project. Consider this scenario: I want to\\ncreate a very simple children\\'s game--perhaps a tic-tac-toe game. I know that the\\nHelloWorld project results in a program that displays a single window and draws\\nto it. That represents a good part of what my game will need to do, so it makes\\nsense for me to base my game on the HelloWorld project, and then modify and\\nadd to the HelloWorld source code as needed. If your program will be a complex\\none, or one for which you can\\'t find a similar \"base\" program to start with, this\\napproach won\\'t be as fruitful. In such cases you\\'ll want to start with a new project.\\nIn this section, I\\'ll discuss each step of the process of setting up a new project first\\nin general terms. I\\'ll also carry out each step using the HelloWorld project to provide a specific example. So you see, I had good reason for devoting the previous\\nseveral pages to a look at the HelloWorld project. While I use the small HelloWorld project for simplicity, the steps discussed on the following pages apply\\njust as well to projects of a much larger scale.\\n\\nIn the above paragraphs, I refer to using code written by others.\\nBefore doing that you\\'ll of course want to make sure that you\\'re\\nallowed to do so! The BeOS CD-ROM comes with a number of\\nexample projects that fall into the category of projects that are available for your own personal use. The source code that makes up the\\nexample projects is copyright Be, Inc., but Be, Inc. has granted unrestricted permission for anyone to use and alter any of this source\\ncode. I\\'ve taken advantage of this fact and used these projects as the\\nbasis for the numerous examples that appear in this book. In turn,\\nyou\\'re free to use without restrictions the example code in this book\\nfor your own projects.\\n\\nThe following is an overview of the major steps you\\'ll carry out each time you create a new project. While on the surface it may appear that performing these steps\\ninvolves a lot of work, you\\'ll find that after you\\'ve set up a few new projects the\\nprocess becomes quite routine, and doesn\\'t take much time at all. All of the steps\\nare discussed in the sections that follow this list.\\n1. Find an existing project that is used to build a program that has similarities to\\nthe program you\\'re to develop.\\n2. Duplicate the existing project folder and its contents.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\n3. Open the new project folder and change the names of the project, source\\ncode, header, and resource files to names that reflect the nature of the project\\nyou\\'re working on.\\n4. Open the newly renamed project and drag the renamed source code files and\\nresource file from the folder and drop them into the project window.\\n5. Remove the now obsolete source code and resource filenames from the\\nproject window.\\n6. Edit the name of the constants in the #ifndef directive in the header files and\\nthe #includes in the source files.\\n7. Test the project\\'s code by building an application (here you\\'re verifying that\\nthe original source code is error-free before you start modifying it)\\n8. If there are library-related errors, create a new project (which will automatically include the most recent versions of each library) and add the source\\ncode files and resource file to the new project.\\n9. If there are compilation errors, correct the source code that caused the errors.\\n10. Open the header files and change application-defined class names in the\\nheader files to names that make sense for the project you\\'re working on.\\n11. Change all usage of application-defined class names in the source files to\\nmatch the changes you made in the header files.\\n12. Open the resource file using FileTypes and modify any of the `APPI\\' resource\\ninformation and the icon.\\n13. Set the name for the executable to be built.\\n14. Build a new application from the modified BeIDE project.\\nNo new functionality will have been added to the program that gets built from the\\nnew project--it will behave identically to the program that results from the original project. So why go through the above busy-work? Executing the above steps\\nresults in a new project that includes source code files that define and use classes\\nwith new names--names that make sense to you. This will be beneficial when you\\nstart the real work--implementing the functionality your new program requires.\\n\\nThe above list isn\\'t an iron-clad set of steps you must follow. Other\\nprogrammers have their own slightly (or, perhaps, very) different\\nguidelines they follow when starting a new project. If you\\'re new to\\nthe BeIDE, the BeOS, or both, though, you might want to follow my\\nsteps now. As you get comfortable with working in a project-based\\nprogramming environment, you can vary the steps to match your\\npreferred way of doing things.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nSelecting and Setting Up a Base Project\\nAs mentioned, you\\'ll get off to the best start in your programming endeavor by\\nfinding a project that matches the following criteria:\\n\\n\\nThe application that is built from the original project has several features common to the program you\\'re to develop.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have access to the project and all its source code and resource files.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s made clear that the project\\'s source code can be modified and redistributed, or you have the developer\\'s permission to do so.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve found a project that meets the above conditions, you\\'ve performed\\nStep 1 from the previous section\\'s numbered list.\\nStep 2 involves creating a copy of the project folder and its contents. After doing\\nthat, rename the new folder to something appropriate for the project you\\'re\\nembarking upon. Usually a project folder has the same name that the final application that gets built from the project will have. Here I\\'m making a new project\\nbased on the HelloWorld project only for the sake of providing a specific example, so after duplicating the HelloWorld folder, I\\'ll simply change the name of the\\nfolder from HelloWorld copy to MyHelloWorld (each of these folders can be found\\nin the Chapter 2 examples folder available on the O\\'Reilly web site).\\nStep 3 is the renaming of the project-related files. Double-click on the new folder\\nto reveal its contents. Click on the name of any one of the header files and type a\\nnew name for the file. For my new MyHelloWorld project I\\'ll rename the HelloView.h, HelloWindow.h, and HelloWorld.h header files to MyHelloView.h, MyHelloWindow.h, and MyHelloWorld.h, respectively. Next, rename the source code files\\n(so, for example, HelloWorld.cpp becomes MyHelloWorld.cpp) and the resource\\nfile (here, from HelloWorld.rsrc to MyHelloWorld.rsrc). Now rename the project\\nfile. Again, choose a name appropriate to the project. Typically, the project file has\\nthe same name the application will have, with an extension of x86.proj or ppc.proj\\nadded. I\\'ll change the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld project by updating the\\nproject filename from HelloWorld_ppc.proj to MyHelloWorld_ppc.proj.\\nSteps 4 and 5 are performed to get the project to recognize the newly named files.\\nAfter the name changes are made, double-click on the project file to open it. The\\nproject window will appear on your screen. If you renamed a file from the desktop, the project file that includes that file will list it by its original, now invalid,\\nname. That necessitates adding the file by its new name and removing the original file from the project. To add the newly named files, select them from the desktop (click on each) and drag and drop them into the project window. In the\\nproject window, drag each to its appropriate group (for instance, place MyHelloWorld.cpp in the Sources group). To remove the original files from the project,\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nselect each and choose Remove Selected Items from the Project menu. For the\\nMyHelloWorld project, the resulting project window looks like the one shown in\\nFigure 2-10.\\n\\nFigure 2-10. The MyHelloWorld project window with renamed files in it\\n\\nTesting the Base Project\\nThe new project now has newly named files in it, but these files hold the code\\nfrom the original project. Before adding new functionality to the code, verify that it\\ncompiles without error (this is Step 7 from the previous list). Before compiling the\\ncode, though, perform Step 6--update the #includes at the top of each source\\ncode file so that they match the new names of the header files. For example, near\\nthe top of MyHelloView.cpp is this #include:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n\\nI\\'ve changed the HelloView.h header file to MyHelloView.h, so this #include\\nneeds to be edited. While I\\'m doing that, I\\'ll change HELLO_VIEW_H to the more\\nappropriate MY_HELLO_VIEW_H (though I could leave this as is--it\\'s simply a constant I define in the MyHelloView.h header file).\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n\\nBecause I changed the name of the constant HELLO_VIEW_H in the MyHelloView.\\ncpp source file, I need to change this same constant in the MyHelloView.h header\\nfile. Originally the header file contained this code:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nNow that code should look like this:\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\nFinally, test the code by choosing Run from the Project menu. Later, if you experience compilation errors after you\\'ve introduced changes to the original code,\\nyou\\'ll know that the errors are a direct result of your changes and not related to\\nproblems with the original code.\\nIf the building of an application is successful, Steps 8 and 9 are skipped. If the\\nattempt to build an application results in library-related errors (such as a library\\n\"file not found\" type of error), you\\'re probably working with a project created\\nunder a previous version of the BeIDE. The easiest way to get the proper libraries\\ninto a project is to follow Step 8--create a new project based on one of the Besupplied project stationeries. A new BeIDE project file can be created by choosing\\nNew Project from the File menu of an existing project. When you do that, the New\\nProject dialog box appears to let you choose a project stationery from which the\\nnew project is to be based. The project stationery is nothing more than a template\\nthat specifies which libraries and project settings are best suited for the type of\\nproject you\\'re creating. Here are definitions of the more important stationeries:\\nBeApp\\nStationery that links against the standard libraries applications need.\\nEverythingApp\\nStationery that links against all of the Be libraries.\\nKernelDriver\\nA basic template for writing a kernel driver.\\nSharedLib\\nStationery used to create a basic library or add-on, this links against the basic\\nBe libraries.\\nBeSTL\\nStationery used to create an application that includes the C++ standard libraries (including STL and the basic iostream functions).\\nIn Figure 2-11, I\\'m choosing the BeApp project stationery under the ppc heading in\\norder to create a project that\\'s set up to generate a Be application targeted for the\\nPowerPC platform (the list of project stationeries you see may differ depending on\\nthe version of the BeOS you\\'re using and the processor (PowerPC or Intel) in your\\nmachine). Note that when creating a new project you\\'ll want to uncheck the Create Folder checkbox in the New Project dialog box and specify that the new\\nproject end up in the folder that holds all the renamed files.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-11. Choosing a stationery on which to base a new project\\n\\nThe act of creating a new project doesn\\'t provide you with any source code files\\nor a resource file--you\\'ll need to repeat Step 4. That is, drag and drop the necessary files from the desktop folder to the new project window.\\nIf the building of an application results in compilation errors, now\\'s the time to\\ncorrect them. This is Step 9. Only after you successfully build an application does\\nit make sense to start making changes to the project\\'s source code.\\n\\nPreliminary Code Changes\\nYou\\'ll of course be making changes to the source code in the source code files.\\nThe most interesting of these changes will be the ones that turn the original code\\ninto code that results in an application that is distinctly your own. First, however,\\nyou need to make some preliminary source code changes. You\\'ve changed the\\nnames of the files, including the header files, so you\\'ll need to search for and\\nchange header file references in the source code files. You\\'ll also want to change\\nthe names of the classes already defined to match the names you\\'ve given to the\\nheader files.\\nHeader file code changes\\nStep 10 in the list of new project setup tasks is the changing of application-defined\\nclass names in the header files. Begin the changes by opening any one of the\\nheader files. The quickest way to do that is to click on the small arrow icon to the\\nright of one of the source code filenames in the project window. Doing that displays a menu that lists the header files included in the selected source code file.\\nTo open a header file, simply select it from this popup menu. With a header file\\nopen, make the following changes to the code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd the new name of the file to the file\\'s description comment section.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already done so, rename the application-defined constant that is\\nused in the #ifndef and #define preprocessor directives.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the file\\'s application-defined class.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the class constructor to match the new name you\\'ve give to the application-defined class.\\n\\nThe above steps are carried out in the same way regardless of the project you start\\nwith. To provide a specific example of how these changes are implemented, I\\'ll\\nchange the HelloView.h header file from the HelloWorld project. The following\\nlisting shows the original version of the HelloView.h file. Refer to it in the discussion that follows the listing.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------HelloView.h\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#ifndef _VIEW_H\\n#include <View.h>\\n#endif\\nclass HelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n#endif\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe first change to the header file, the altering of the file\\'s descriptive comment,\\nneeds little discussion. You may want to leave the original name intact as a courtesy to the original author. I\\'ve done that in the MyHelloView.h file (the listing of\\nwhich follows this discussion).\\nThe HELLO_VIEW_H constant is defined to eliminate the possibility of the code in\\nthis header file being included more than once in the same source code file. Earlier I changed its name to MY_HELLO_VIEW_H to reflect the new name I\\'ve given to\\nthis header file (MyHelloView.h):\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe _VIEW_H constant is a BeOS-defined constant (it\\'s used to ensure that the\\nBeOS header file View.h doesn\\'t get included multiple times) so it can be left as is.\\nIf you aren\\'t clear on the usage of the #ifndef preprocessor directive in Be files,\\nrefer to the \"Header Files and Preprocessor Directives\" sidebar.\\nThe original class defined in the HelloView.h file was named HelloView. I\\'ve\\nrenamed that class to MyHelloView to match the name I\\'ve given the header file. I\\nalso changed the name of the class constructor from HelloView() to\\nMyHelloView(). All of lines of code that include changes are shown in bold in\\nthe following listing of MyHelloView.h:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------MyHelloView.h\\nDan Parks Sydow\\nBased on source code from:\\nHelloView.h\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#ifndef _VIEW_H\\n#include <View.h>\\n#endif\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n#endif\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNotice that I\\'ve stopped short of making any substantial changes to the application-defined class. While you may be tempted to \"get going\" and start adding new\\nmember functions to a class, it\\'s best to wait. First, make all the name changes in\\nthe header files. Then update the source code files so that any usage of application-defined classes reflects the new names (that\\'s discussed next). Finally, verify\\nthat everything works by compiling the code. Only after you\\'re satisfied that all the\\npreliminaries are taken care of will you want to start making significant changes to\\nthe code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld project, I\\'d repeat the above process on the MyHelloWindow.h and MyHelloWorld.h header files.\\n\\nHeader Files and Preprocessor Directives\\nIn a large project that consists of numerous source code files and header files,\\nthe potential for a source code file to include the same header file more than\\nonce exists. Consider three files from a large project: source file S1.cpp and\\nincludes H2.h, then S1.cpp will include the code from H2.h twice (once directly\\nand once indirectly via H1.h). Such an event results in a compilation error that,\\ngiven the dependency of the files, can be difficult to remedy.\\nTo coordinate the inclusion of header file code in source code files, Be projects\\ntypically use the \"if not defined\" (#ifndef) preprocessor conditional directive\\nto define a constant in a header file and to check for the definition of that constant in a source code file. This is a standard technique used by many C and\\nC++ programmers--if you\\'re familiar with it, you can feel free to skip the\\nremainder of this sidebar.\\nA header file in a Be project begins by checking to see if a particular constant\\nis defined. If it isn\\'t defined, the header file defines it. Because all the remaining\\ncode in the header file lies between the #ifndef and the #endif directives,\\nif the constant is already defined, the entire contents of the header file are\\nskipped. Here\\'s that code from the HelloWorld project\\'s HelloView.h header\\nfile:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n// class declaration\\n#endif\\n\\nBefore including a header file, a source code file checks to see if the constant\\ndefined in the header file is in fact defined. If it isn\\'t defined, the source code\\nfile does include the header file. Here\\'s that code from the HelloView.cpp\\nsource code file:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n\\n#endif source code file code changes\\nAfter you make the changes to the header files, it\\'s time to update the source code\\nfiles--this is Step 10 in the list of new project setup steps. Begin by double-clicking on one of the source code filenames in the project window. Then make the\\nfollowing changes to the code:\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd the new name of the file to the file\\'s description comment section.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the application-defined constant that is used in the #ifndef and\\n#define preprocessor directives to match the renamed constant in the corresponding header file.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename any header filenames that follow #include directives to match the\\nrenamed header files.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename all occurrences of any application-defined classes to match the\\nrenamed classes in the other project header files.\\n\\nAs with header files changes, the source code file changes listed above apply to\\nany project. Again, I\\'ll use a file from the HelloWorld project to provide a specific\\nexample. The following listing shows the original version of the HelloView.cpp file:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------HelloView.cpp\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNext you\\'ll see the edited version of HelloView.cpp--it\\'s now the code for a file\\nnamed MyHelloView.cpp. Because there are no occurrences of any applicationdefined class names in the code in the bodies of any of the member functions, I\\'ve\\nomitted that code for brevity.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------MyHelloView.cpp\\nDan Parks Sydow\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nBased on source code from:\\nHelloView.cpp\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\nMyHelloView::MyHelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThese steps need to be repeated for each source code file in the project. As you\\ndo that, note that a source code file may include occurrences of applicationdefined classes other than the class defined in the corresponding header file. Consider this snippet from the original HelloWorld.cpp file:\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\nHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\nHere you see that the constructor for the application-defined HelloApplication\\nclass declares variables of two different application-defined classes: HelloWindow\\nand HelloView. After renaming the HelloWorld.cpp file to MyHelloWorld.cpp, the\\nchanges to the above snippet would turn it into code that looks like this:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myworld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe astute reader will have noticed that I slipped an extra change in the above\\nsnippet. If you didn\\'t spot it, look at the parameter to the BApplication() constructor. Later in this chapter you\\'ll see that I also use the FileTypes application to\\nplace this same signature in the project\\'s resource file.\\nA quicker way to make the changes\\nYou may have found all this talk about manually editing header files and source\\ncode files a little disconcerting. Before your level of frustration rises too high, it\\'s\\ntime for me to make a confession. There is a shortcut to poring over page after\\npage of code to track down occurrences of class names that need to be changed--\\na shortcut I didn\\'t mention at the onset of the \"Preliminary Code Changes\" section. The BeIDE has a search and replace utility that makes finding and replacing\\nnames (such as constants and class names) a snap.\\nBefore discussing how to quickly make global changes to all of the files in a\\nproject, I\\'ll answer the one question that\\'s on your mind: Why did I bother with\\nthe drawn-out explanation of exactly what changes to make if everything could be\\ndone with a few mouse clicks? I went laboriously through all the changes so that\\nyou\\'d know what you\\'re changing and why.\\nNow, here\\'s a revised method for changing the names of constants, files, and\\nclasses that appear in the header files and source code files of a project:\\n1. Choose Open from the BeIDE main menu in the dock and open a header file.\\n2. Choose Find from the Search menu of the opened header file.\\n3. Set up the Find window to search the project\\'s source code files and header\\nfiles.\\n4. Enter a name to change in the Find box and the name to replace it with in the\\nReplace box of the Find window.\\n5. Click on the Find button in the Find window.\\n6. After verifying that the found text should indeed be replaced, click on the\\nReplace & Find button in the Find window.\\n7. Repeat Step 6 until all occurrences of the name have been found and\\nchanged.\\n8. Repeat Steps 4 though 8 for each name to be changed.\\nYou can speed things up by using the Replace All button once in place of the\\nReplace & Find button several times. However, it\\'s safer to use the Replace & Find\\nbutton so that you can take a quick look at each name the BeIDE is changing.\\nIf you want to perform a multiple-file search, the file icon located on the left side\\nof the Find window must be displaying two files and the Find window must be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nexpanded as shown in Figure 2-12. If the file icon is displaying a single file, click\\non the icon (it toggles between one and two files). If the Find window isn\\'t\\nexpanded (the Multi-File Search section won\\'t be visible), click on the small blue\\narrow located to the left of the file icon (the arrow expands and collapses the Find\\nwindow).\\n\\nFigure 2-12. The BeIDE Find window set up to search all of a project\\'s files\\n\\nWith the Find window set for multiple-file searching, specify which files are to be\\nincluded in a search. Check the Sources checkbox to designate that all of the\\nsource code files listed in the project window are to be searched. To specify that\\nthe header files also be included in the search, you\\'ll be tempted to check the\\nProject Headers checkbox. At this point, however, the BeIDE doesn\\'t know that\\nthe project source code files will be including the renamed header files--so it\\nwon\\'t know to add the desired files to the Multi-File Search list. Instead, click on\\nthe Others button. In the Select a File to Search window that appears, Shift-click\\non the names of each of the renamed header files. That is, hold down the Shift\\nkey and successively click the mouse button while the cursor is over each header\\nfilename in the window\\'s list of files. Click the Add button, then the Done button.\\nTo quickly change a name, enter the name to change in the Find box, enter the\\nnew name in the Replace box, and click the Replace All button. The BeIDE will\\nsearch all the project files for the name to find and replace each occurrence with\\nthe new name. For my MyHelloWorld project I began by searching for the constant HELLO_VIEW_H and replacing it with the new constant MY_HELLO_VIEW_H.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nYou can see in Figure 2-12 that the Find window is set up to perform that act.\\nWhen done (it will only take a moment), enter another name and another new\\nname in the Find and Replace boxes and again click on the Replace All button.\\nRepeat these steps until all of the necessary changes have been made.\\nA click on the Replace All button quickly searches all of the files in a project and\\nreplaces all hits with new text. That makes the BeIDE Find facility a very powerful utility--too powerful if you aren\\'t sure what you\\'re changing. Hence my reasoning for describing this technique after the discussion on just what needs to be\\nchanged in the files of a project. Now, if you make a mistake that results in an\\nerror when you compile the project\\'s code, you\\'ll know where to look and what\\nto look for to remedy the errors.\\nTesting the changes\\nAfter making all the changes to a project, compile the code by choosing Make\\nfrom the Project menu in the project window\\'s menubar. This menu item compiles all touched files and then builds a new version of the application. A touched\\nfile is one that has been edited since the last time the file was compiled. Before\\nmoving on to the \"real\" code changes--the possibly extensive changes and additions you\\'ll be making to implement your program\\'s functionality--you\\'ll want to\\nverify that the \"cosmetic\" changes you\\'ve just made didn\\'t introduce any errors.\\n\\nEditing the Resource File\\nYou\\'ll want to give your application a unique signature and its own icon. The\\n`APPI\\' and `ICON\\' resources are both located in the project\\'s resource file, so the\\nFileTypes application is involved in both these acts.\\nChanging the signature\\nTo edit the signature to be merged with the application built from the new project,\\ndouble-click on project\\'s resource file. This launches the FileTypes application and\\nopens a window that holds `APPI\\' information (refer back to Figure 2-8 for an\\nexample). To complete Step 12 of the new project setup process, modify the\\n`APPI\\' information as needed. Most likely this will involve nothing more than\\nentering a new, unique signature to be assigned to the application that makes use\\nof the resource file. For the MyHelloWorld project, I changed the signature in the\\nMyHelloWorld.rsrc file to application/x-vnd.dps-myworld.\\nAfter changing the signature, you can choose Save from the File menu of the FileTypes window to save the change--but don\\'t close the window just yet.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nChanging the icon\\nTo modify the icon housed in the resource file, double-click on the icon box\\nlocated in the upper right corner of the Application Type window. Then draw\\naway. That, in brief, is the rest of Step 12.\\nThe Tracker--the software that allows you to work with files and launch applications in the BeOS--displays icons in one of two sizes: 32 pixels by 32 pixels or 16\\npixels by 16 pixels. The larger size is the more commonly used, but you\\'ve seen\\nthe smaller size on occasion. For example, the active application displays its\\nsmaller icon in the area you click on to reveal the items in the main menu. For\\neach icon resource, you\\'ll draw both the larger and smaller variants. At the top\\nright of the window back in Figure 2-9, you\\'ll see the editing area for both variants of the icon in the HelloWorld.rsrc file. Clicking on either icon displays an\\nenlarged, editable view of that icon in the editing area.\\nIn the top right area of the window, you\\'ll see a total of four actual-size icons. You\\ncan refer to these views to see how the 32-by-32 version and the 16-by-16 version\\nwill look on the desktop. There are two views of each sized icon to demonstrate\\nhow each looks normally and when selected (a selected icon has extra shading\\nadded by the BeOS).\\nYou\\'ll treat the large and small versions of an icon separately--editing one version has no effect on the other version. IconWorld will assign the larger version a\\nresource type of `ICON\\' and the smaller version a resource type of `MICN\\' (for\\n\"mini-icon\"). Because each icon has both a large and small version, IconWorld will\\nsave the two versions of the icon as a single unit.\\nYou\\'ll of course want to replace the original icon with one of your own creation.\\nTo do that, use the drawing tools and color palette to erase the old icon and draw\\na new one. Creating an icon in FileTypes is a lot like creating a small picture in a\\npaint program, so you\\'re on familiar ground here. If you aren\\'t artistically inclined,\\nat least draw a simple icon that distinguishes your program from the other program icons on your desktop. When done, click on the smaller editing area and\\nthen draw a smaller version of the icon. That\\'s what I did for the MyHelloWorld\\nexample I\\'m working on. I show off my creative abilities back in Figure 2-9.\\nIf you\\'re developing a program that will be distributed to others (rather than one\\nthat will be for your personal use only), you can find or hire someone else to\\ndraw a 32-pixel-by-32-pixel and a 16-pixel-by-16-pixel picture for you at a later\\ntime.\\nWhen you\\'re done with the new icon, choose Save from the File menu of the\\nIcon-O-Matic window, then close the Icon-O-Matic window. Now choose Save\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nfrom the File menu of the FileTypes window. Close the FileTypes window. This\\ncompletes Step 12.\\n\\nSetting Project Preferences\\nBesides keeping track of the files that hold what will become a program\\'s executable code, a project also keeps track of a variety of project settings. The font in\\nwhich source code is displayed and the types of compilation errors to be displayed are just two examples of project settings. There\\'s a good chance that most\\nof the copied project\\'s settings will be fine just as they are. You will, however,\\nwant to make one quick change. Step 13 specifies that you need to set the name\\nof the application about to be built--you do that in the Settings window.\\nTo display the project Settings window, choose Settings from the Window menu in\\nthe project file. On the left side of the window that appears is a list that holds a\\nvariety of settings categories. Click on the xxx Project item under the Project heading in this list (where xxx specifies the target, such as PPC for PowerPC). The Settings window responds by displaying several project-related items on the right side\\nof the window.\\nFrom the displayed items you\\'ll set the name that will be assigned to the application that gets built from the project. The MyHelloWorld project is used to build a\\nprogram that gets the name MyHelloWorld. Note that while the file type may look\\nlike a program signature (they\\'re both MIME strings), the two aren\\'t the same. The\\nfile type specifies the general type of file being created, such as a Be application.\\nThe file signature (assigned in the FileTypes window, as discussed earlier) gives an\\napplication a unique signature that differentiates the file from all other applications.\\nAfter changing the information in the File Name field, click the Save button. This is\\nthe only setting change you need to make, though you\\'re of course free to explore\\nthe Settings window by clicking on any of the other setting topics in the list.\\n\\nTesting the Changes\\nAfter making all your changes, you\\'ll want to test things out--that\\'s the last step in\\nmy list of how to create a new project. Choose Run from the Project menu in the\\nproject window\\'s menubar. This will cause the BeIDE to:\\n1. Compile any files that have been touched (altered) since the last build.\\n2. Link the compiled code to build an application.\\n3. Merge resources from the resource file with the built application.\\n4. Run the application.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nTo verify that your changes to the resource file were noted by the BeIDE, return to\\nthe desktop and look in your project folder. There you should find your new\\napplication, complete with its own icon. Figure 2-13 shows the MyHelloWorld\\nfolder as it looks after my test build of a PowerPC version of the program.\\n\\nFigure 2-13. The MyHelloWorld project folder after building an application\\n\\nThe MyHelloWorld folder in Figure 2-13 shows one folder and two files that I had\\nno hand in creating. The (Objects) folder holds, obviously enough, the object code\\nthat the BeIDE generated when compiling the project\\'s source code. The .xMAP\\nand .xSYM files were generated by the BeIDE during the building of the project\\'s\\napplication. The files in the (Objects) folder and the .xMAP and .xSYM files aren\\'t\\ndirectly of use to you--they\\'re used by the BeIDE during linking and debugging. If\\nI were working on a PC and did a build of an Intel version of the MyHelloWorld\\nprogram, my project folder would look a little different. There\\'d be no .xMAP or\\n.xSYM files, as these are PowerPC-only. Instead, the information in these files\\n(namely the symbol table and the debugging information for the application)\\nwould be contained in the ELF binary itself. There might also be a number of .d\\nfiles, which are temporary dependency files the compilers create (and which may\\nbe better disposed of in a future release of the BeOS).\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s Next?\\nAfter reading this section you know how to create a project that\\'s ready for your\\nown use. Now you need to make the source code changes and additions that will\\ncut the ties from the original project on which you\\'re basing your new program.\\nSo you need to know a lot more about writing BeOS code. The next section starts\\nyou in that direction, and the remainder of this book takes you the rest of the way.\\n\\nHelloWorld Source Code\\nIn the previous section, you saw that a new BeIDE project is usually based on an\\nexisting project. Once you have a mastery of BeOS programming, you\\'ll be able to\\nlook at existing projects and recognize which one or ones result in a program that\\nbears some similarity to the program you intend to develop. Until that time, it\\nmakes sense to use a small project such as the HelloWorld project as your starting\\npoint. If you follow my advice and do that, your new project will hold the\\nHelloWorld source code. You got a glimpse of some of that code earlier in this\\nchapter. Because you\\'ll be modifying the HelloWorld source code, you\\'ll find it\\nbeneficial to have a good understanding of that code. This section provides you\\nwith that.\\n\\nThe HelloWorld/SimpleApp/MyHelloWorld\\nConnection\\nThe HelloWorld project defines three classes: HelloView, HelloWindow, and\\nHelloApplication. Two of these classes, HelloWindow and HelloApplication, bear a strong resemblance to the SimpleWindow and SimpleApplication classes from the SimpleApp example that was introduced in\\nChapter 1. Actually, the opposite is true--the SimpleApp classes are based on the\\nHelloWorld classes.\\nTo create the SimpleApp project, I started with the HelloWorld project. I then followed this chapter\\'s steps for renaming the project files and renaming the application-defined classes. If you think that my following a Chapter 2 process while writing Chapter 1 was a good trick, just wait--there\\'s more! I then wrote SimpleApp\\nsuch that it became a simplified version of the HelloWorld program. Not many\\nbooks can lay claim to simplifying what is traditionally the most basic program that\\ncan be written for an operating system.\\nIn order to keep this book\\'s first example small and simple, I deleted the HelloView.cpp and HelloView.h files and removed any references to the class that was\\ndefined and implemented in those two files--the HelloView class. I also stripped\\nout the #ifndef and #define preprocessor directives to further simplify things.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nNow that the relationship between the Chapter 1 SimpleApp example project\\nand the Be-supplied HelloWorld project has been established, where does the\\nMyHelloWorld project fit in? As you saw in this chapter, the MyHelloWorld project\\nalso came about by duplicating the HelloWorld project. I renamed the files and the\\napplication-defined classes, but I left all the other code intact. Building an application from the MyHelloWorld project results in a program indistinguishable from\\nthe application that gets built from the HelloWorld project (except for the look of\\nthe application\\'s icon).\\nIn this section I describe the code that makes up the HelloWorld project. At the\\nend of this section I make a few minor changes to this code. When I do that I\\'ll\\nuse the MyHelloWorld project so that I can leave the original HelloWorld project\\nuntouched, and so that I can justify the time I invested in making the MyHelloWorld project!\\n\\nHelloWorld View Class\\nA view is a rectangular area in which drawing takes place. Drawing is an important part of almost all Be programs, so views are important too. Views are discussed at length in Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so I\\'ll spare you the\\ndetails here. I will, however, provide a summary of views so that you aren\\'t in the\\ndark until you reach the fourth chapter.\\nA view can encompass the entire content area of a window--but it doesn\\'t have\\nto. That is, a window\\'s content area can consist of a single view or it can be\\ndivided into two or more views. Note that a view has no visible frame, so when I\\nsay that a window can be divided, I\\'m referring to a conceptual division--the user\\nwon\\'t be aware of the areas occupied by views in a window.\\nA view serves as an independent graphics environment, or state. A view has its\\nown coordinate grid so that the location at which something is drawn in the view\\ncan be kept independent of other views that may be present in a window. A view\\nhas a large set of drawing characteristics associated with it, and keeps track of the\\ncurrent state of these characteristics. The font used to draw text in the view and\\nthe width of lines that are to be drawn in the view are two examples of these\\ncharacteristics.\\nThe information about a single view is stored in a view object, which is of the\\nBView class (or a class derived from the BView class). The BView class is a part of\\nthe Interface Kit.\\nWhen a window is created, it doesn\\'t initially have any views attached to (associated with) it. Because drawing always takes place in a view and never directly in a\\nwindow, any program that draws must define a class derived from the BView\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nclass. When the program creates a new window object, it will also create a new\\nBView-derived object and attach this view object to the Window object.\\nA class derived from the BView class will typically define a minimum of three virtual member functions. That is, such a class will override at least three of the many\\nBView member functions. These functions are the constructor function, the\\nAttachedToWindow() function, and the Draw() function. The HelloView class\\ndefined in the HelloWorld project does just that:\\nclass HelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\nThese member functions, along with several other BView member functions, are\\ndiscussed at length in Chapter 4. Here I\\'ll provide only a brief overview of each.\\nThe purpose of the constructor is to establish the size of the view and, optionally,\\nprovide a name for the view (NULL can be passed as the second parameter). If a\\nwindow is to have only a single view, then the first parameter to the constructor is\\na rectangle of the same size as the content area of the window the view is to be\\nattached to.\\nThe HelloView constructor does nothing more than invoke the BView class constructor. When a HelloView view object is created by the HelloWorld program,\\nthe program passes to the HelloView constructor the size and name the view is to\\nhave. The HelloView constructor will in turn pass that information on to the\\nBView constructor (as the rect and name parameters). The third BView constructor parameter describes how the view is to be resized as its window is resized.\\nThe Be constant B_FOLLOW_ALL sets the view to be resized in tandem with any\\nresizing of the window. The final BView constructor parameter determines the\\ntypes of notifications the view is to receive from the system. The Be constant\\nB_WILL_DRAW means that the view should be notified when the visible portions of\\nthe view change (and an update is thus necessary).\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nYou might not be able to fully initialize a view object when creating it--some\\ncharacteristics of the view may be dependent on the window the view becomes\\nattached to. Thus the existence of the BView member function\\nAttachedToView(). This function is automatically called by the operating system\\nwhen the view is attached to a window (covered ahead in the discussion of the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nHelloWorld\\'s application class). The characteristics of the view should be included\\nin the implementation of AttachedToWindow().\\nThe HelloView version of AttachedToWindow() sets the font and font size that\\nare to be used for any text drawing that takes place within the view:\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nThe SetFont() and SetFontSize() functions are member functions of the\\nBView class. The function names make the purpose of each obvious, so I won\\'t\\noffer any more information here. You will, however, find plenty of information on\\ndrawing strings in Chapter 5, Drawing.\\nIn Chapter 1 you saw member functions invoked via an object--as in the\\nSimpleWindow object invoking the BWindow member function Show():\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nIn the AttachedToWindow() member function you see that the BView member\\nfunctions SetFont() and SetFontSize() are invoked without the use of an\\nobject.\\n\\nAs a C++ programmer, it should be obvious how a member function can be invoked in this way. If it isn\\'t, read on. The implementation of a member function results in a routine that can be invoked\\nby any object of the type of class to which the function belongs.\\nTherefore, the code that makes up a member function can operate\\non any number of objects. When a member function includes code\\nthat invokes a different member function (as the HelloView member function AttachedToWindow() invokes the BView member\\nfunction SetFont()), it is implicit that the invocation is acting on\\nthe current object. So no object prefaces the invocation.\\n\\nThe BView class includes a Draw() member function that automatically gets called\\nwhen the window a view is attached to needs updating. The system keeps track of\\nthe views that are attached to a window, and if more than one view object is\\nattached to a window, the Draw() function for each view object is invoked. The\\nDraw() function should implement the code that does the actual drawing in the\\nview.\\nThe HelloView version of Draw() simply establishes the starting position for drawing a string of text and then draws that string.\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, World!\");\\n}\\n\\nHelloWorld Window Class\\nIn Chapter 1, you received an overview of the BWindow class and classes derived\\nfrom it, so I won\\'t go on at length about those topics here. In fact, I\\'ll barely discuss the HelloWindow class at all. If you need a refresher on defining a class\\nderived from BWindow, refer back to the SimpleApp example in Chapter 1--there\\nyou\\'ll find that the SimpleWindow class consists of the same two member functions (a constructor and the QuitRequested() function) as the HelloWindow\\nclass.\\nclass HelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nIn the SimpleApp project, the only thing the SimpleWindow class constructor does\\nis invoke the BWindow class constructor. That\\'s true for the HelloWindow class\\nconstructor as well. The first parameter to the BWindow constructor, which comes\\nfrom the HelloWindow constructor, sets the size of the window. The second\\nparameter is a string that is used as the window\\'s title. The SimpleWindow class\\npasses the string \"A Simple Window,\" while the HelloWindow class passes the\\nmore appropriate string \"Hello.\" The third parameter is a Be-defined constant that\\nspecifies the type of window to be displayed. The final parameter defines the\\nbehavior of the window. The SimpleWindow class passes the constant B_NOT_\\nRESIZABLE, while the HelloWindow class passes the result of combining two constants, B_NOT_RESIZABLE and B_NOT_ZOOMABLE.\\nHelloWindow::HelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE |\\nB_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nYou\\'ve already seen the code that makes up the QuitRequested() function. In\\nthe Chapter 1 SimpleApp project, I left this routine from the HelloWorld project\\nunchanged. Recall from that chapter that the purpose of overriding this BWindow\\nmember function is to cause a mouse click on a window\\'s close button to not only\\nclose the window, but to quit the application as well:\\nbool HelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nHelloWorld Application Class\\nAll programs must define a class derived from the BApplication class. Like the\\nSimpleApp\\'s SimpleApplication class, the HelloWorld\\'s HelloApplication\\nclass consists of just a constructor:\\nclass HelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nHelloApplication();\\n};\\n\\nFor the implementation of the SimpleApplication constructor, I started with the\\nHelloApplication constructor, then stripped out the view-related code. As you\\nlook at the HelloApplication constructor you should recognize much of the\\ncode:\\nHelloWindow\\n...\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\naRect;\\n\\naWindow = new HelloWindow(aRect);\\n...\\n...\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nThis snippet begins by declaring a window variable and a rectangle variable. Next,\\nthe boundaries of the rectangle that sets the window\\'s size are established. Then a\\nnew window object (an object of the HelloWindow class) is created. Finally, the\\nBWindow member function Show() is invoked to display the new window. The\\ncode I omitted from the above snippet is the HelloApplication constructor\\'s\\nview-related code:\\nHelloView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new HelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\n\\nIn the above snippet, the size of the rectangle object isn\\'t changed, but its existing\\nboundaries (as set by the prior call to the BRect member function Set()) are offset. The one parameter in the BRect member function OffsetTo() is the location to move the upper-left corner of the rectangle to. The constant B_ORIGIN tells\\nOffsetTo() to shift the rectangle aRect from its present location such that its\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nupper-left corner aligns with the origin--the point (0, 0). This has the effect of\\ndetails of the coordinate system, by the way, are presented in Chapter 4. Next, a\\nnew HelloView object is created. The HelloView constructor sets the size of the\\nview to aRect and the name of the view to \"HelloView.\" Finally, the window\\nobject aWindow invokes the BWindow member function AddChild() to attach the\\nview to itself. Recall that in order for a view to be of use, it must be attached to a\\nwindow; in order for drawing to take place in a window, it must have a view\\nattached to it.\\nYou\\'ve seen the implementation of the HelloApplication constructor in bits and\\npieces. Here it is in its entirety:\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\nHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new HelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new HelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nYou may have noticed that after the window object is created, no drawing appears\\nto take place. Yet you know that the string \"Hello, World!\" gets drawn in the window. Recall that the updating of a window has the effect of calling the Draw()\\nmember function of any views attached to that window. When aWindow invokes\\nthe BWindow Show() member function, the window is displayed. That forces an\\nupdate to occur. That update, in turn, causes the aView object\\'s Draw() method\\nto be invoked. Look back at the implementation of the HelloView class Draw()\\nmember function to see that it is indeed this routine that draws the string.\\n\\nHelloWorld main() Function\\nWhen I wrote the main() routine for SimpleApp, the only changes I made to the\\nHelloWorld version of main() involved changing HelloApplication references\\nto SimpleApplication references. For the details of what main() does, refer\\nback to Chapter 1. I\\'ll summarize by saying that main() performs the mandatory\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\ncreation of a new application object, then starts the program running by invoking\\nthe BApplication member function Run():\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\nHelloApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nAltering the Source Code\\nTo implement the functionality required of your own program, you\\'ll no doubt\\nmake some changes and substantial additions to the code of whatever project you\\nstart with. After reading a few more chapters, you\\'ll know the details of how to\\ndraw just about anything to a window and how to add controls (such as buttons)\\nto a window. At that point you\\'ll be ready to make large-scale revisions of existing code. While at this early point in the book you may not feel ready to make\\nsweeping changes to Be code, you should be ready to make at least minor revisions. In this section, I\\'ll do that to the HelloWorld project.\\nI\\'ll leave the HelloWorld project intact and instead make the changes to a duplicate project--a project I\\'ve name MyHelloWorld. If you haven\\'t followed the steps\\nin this chapter\\'s \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section, do so now. Besides\\ngetting experience at starting a new project, you\\'ll bring yourself to the point\\nwhere you can follow along with the code changes I\\'m about to make. Here they\\nare:\\n\\n\\nChange the text that is drawn in the window\\n\\n\\n\\nChange the window\\'s title\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a zoom button to the window\\'s tab\\n\\n\\n\\nChange the size of the window\\n\\nAt the top of Figure 2-14, you see the original window from the HelloWorld program, while at the bottom of the figure you see the new window from the MyHelloWorld program.\\nThe drawing that takes place in the MyHelloWorld window is done by the\\nMyHelloView Draw() member function. A call to the BView member function\\nDrawString() writes the string \"Hello, World!\" to the window. Changing this one\\nDrawString() parameter to \"Hello, My World!\" will cause this new string to be\\ndrawn to the window instead. The affected line is in the MyHelloView.cpp file, and\\nis shown here in bold type:\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-14. The window from HelloWindow (top) and MyHelloWindow (bottom)\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n}\\n\\nThe change to the window\\'s title and the addition of a zoom button to the window are both taken care of in the MyHelloWindow class constructor, so I\\'ll open\\nthe MyHelloWindow.cpp file. MyHelloWindow() invokes the BWindow constructor. The second parameter in the BWindow constructor defines the window\\'s title,\\nso changing that parameter from \"Hello\" to \"My Hello\" handles the window title\\nchange. The last parameter in BWindow() is a Be-defined constant, or combination of Be-defined constants, that defines the behavior of the window. In the original HelloWindow class, this parameter was a combination of the constants that\\nspecified that the window be drawn without a resize knob and without a zoom\\nbutton (B_NOT_RESIZABLE | B_NOT_ZOOMABLE). I\\'ll change this parameter to the\\none constant B_NOT_RESIZABLE so that a window created from the\\nMyHelloWindow class will be without a resize knob, but will now have a zoom\\nbutton:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe final change I\\'ll make to the code that came from the HelloWorld project will\\nchange the size of the program\\'s window. The MyHelloApplication constructor\\nuses a BRect object to define the size of the window, so I\\'ll go to this function in\\nthe MyHelloWorld.cpp file to make the change. In the following version of\\nMyHelloApplication(), I\\'ve changed the coordinates of the rectangle object\\nthat\\'s a little larger than the one used in the original HelloWorld program.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myworld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(aRect, \"MyHelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nI can compile all the MyHelloWorld project files, build a new version of the\\nMyHelloWorld program, and run that program by choosing Run from the Project\\nmenu in the menubar of the MyHelloWorld project window. If I\\'ve done everything correctly, the program will display a window that looks like the one at the\\nbottom of Figure 2-14.\\n\\x0c\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Overview of the BeOS\\nSoftware Kits\\n Software Kit Class\\nDescriptions\\n Chapter Example:\\nAdding an Alert to\\nMyHelloWorld\\n3.\\n\\nBeOS API Overview\\n\\nWriting a Be application generally involves starting with an existing base of code\\nand then using several of the Be software kit classes to add new functionality to\\nthe base code. In Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects, you saw how to ready an existing\\nproject to serve as the base for your new project. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to\\nselect and use a software kit class to modify your new project.\\nThis chapter begins with an overview of the Be software kits. Knowing the purpose of each kit will help you quickly hone in on which kits will be of the most\\nuse in your project. After finding a kit of interest, you need to locate a useful class\\nwithin that kit. To do that, you\\'ll use the Be Book--the electronic document by\\nBe, Inc. that serves as the BeOS class reference. Once you\\'ve found a class of possible interest, you\\'ll read through the Be Book\\'s class description to find out all\\nabout the class: an overview of how objects are created, what they\\'re useful for,\\nand so forth. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to get the most out of the class\\ndescriptions in the Be Book.\\nThe Be Book is essential documentation for any Be programmer--but it isn\\'t a\\ntutorial. In this chapter, I close by looking at how the Be Book describes one class\\n(the BAlert class), and then go on to integrate an object of this class type in a\\nsimple program. The remaining chapters in this book provide example snippets\\nand programs that \"bring to life\" the class descriptions found in the Be Book.\\n\\nOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\nChapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview, provided a very brief description of each\\nkit--only a sentence or two. Because you hadn\\'t been exposed to any of the\\ndetails of BeOS programming at that point, out of necessity those descriptions\\ndidn\\'t give examples of kit classes and member functions. Now that you\\'ve\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nstudied the fundamentals of Be programming and have looked at some example\\nsource code, it\\'s time to rewrite the kit summaries, with an emphasis on the key\\nclasses and a few important member functions.\\nThe focus of this book is on the first three kits described below: the Application\\nKit, the Interface Kit, and the Storage Kit. Don\\'t feel as if you\\'re being shortchanged, though--these kits provide dozens of classes that allow you to create\\nfull-featured applications complete with windows, graphics, editable text, and all\\nmanner of controls.\\nWhile each of the software kits isn\\'t represented by its own chapter in this book,\\nall are at least briefly described below for the sake of completeness. A couple of\\nthe these kits can\\'t be covered, as they aren\\'t complete as of this writing. Be provides information on kit updates at the developer web page at http://www.be.com/\\ndevelopers, so you\\'ll want to check that site occasionally. Other kits are complete,\\nbut their specialized functionality makes detailed descriptions out of scope for this\\nbook. Note that while some kits don\\'t have a chapter devoted to them, some of\\ntheir classes appear throughout the book. See the description of the Support Kit\\nbelow for a specific example concerning the BLocker class.\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nThe classes of the Application Kit communicate with the Application Server and\\ndirectly with the kernel. Every program must create a single instance of a class\\nderived from the Application Kit class BApplication--the HelloWorld program\\nprovides an example of how this is typically done. This BApplication object is\\nnecessary for a couple of reasons. The application object:\\n\\n\\nMakes a connection to the Application Server. This connection is vital if the\\nprogram is to display and maintain windows, which of course most Be programs do.\\n\\n\\n\\nRuns the program\\'s main message loop. This loop provides a messaging system that keeps the program aware of events (such as a press of a keyboard\\nkey by the user).\\n\\nAn important member function of the BApplication class is Run(). The main()\\nfunction of every Be program must create an instance of the BApplication class\\nand then invoke Run() to start the program.\\nThe BApplication class is derived from two other Application Kit classes--\\nBLooper and BHandler. A BLooper object creates and then controls a message\\nloop, a thread that exits to transfer messages to objects. A BHandler object is one\\nthat is capable of receiving a message from a BLooper object--it handles a message received from a message loop. Because a BApplication object is also a\\n\\x0cOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\n\\n\\nBLooper and BHandler object, it acts as both a message loop and a message handler. Refer to Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1 for a look at the Application Kit class hierarchy that illustrates the relationship between the BApplication and BLooper and\\nBHandler classes.\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nWith over two dozen classes, the Interface Kit is the largest of the Be software kits.\\nIt\\'s also the one you\\'ll make the most use of--as will this book. The chapters from\\nChapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, through Chapter 8, Text, deal almost\\nexclusively with this kit. In Chapter 1 you saw that a window is an object derived\\nfrom an Interface Kit class--the BWindow class. In Chapter 2 you were introduced\\nto the concept that all drawing in a window is done via an object derived from\\nanother Interface Kit class--the BView class (much more on this important topic\\nappears in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, Drawing). In subsequent chapters you\\'ll learn\\nthat controls (such as buttons and checkboxes), strings, and menus are also types\\nof views (objects of classes that are derived from the BView class). Because all\\ndrawing takes place in a view, and because all of the aforementioned items are\\ndrawn, this should seem reasonable. It should also shed more light on the class\\nhierarchy of the Interface Kit, as shown in Figure 1-4 back in Chapter 1.\\nLike a BApplication object (see the Application Kit above), a BWindow object is\\nderived from both the BLooper and BHandler classes, so it is both an organizer\\nof messages in a message loop and a handler of messages. When an event is\\ndirected at a window (such as a mouse button click while the cursor is over a window\\'s close button), the system transfers a message to the window object\\'s thread.\\nBecause the window is a message handler as well as a message loop, it may also\\nbe able to handle the message.\\nA window contains one or more views--objects of the BView class or one of its\\nmany derived classes. Often a window has one view that is the same size as the\\ncontent area of the window (or larger than the content area of the window if it\\nincludes scrollbars). This view then serves as a holder of other views. These\\nsmaller, nested, views can consist of areas of the window that are to act independently of one another. Any one of these smaller views may also be used to display a single interface item, such as a button or a scrollbar. Because the contents\\nof a view are automatically redrawn when a window is updated, it makes sense\\nthat each interface item exists in its own view. Some of the Interface Kit control\\nclasses that are derived from the BView class (and which you\\'ll work with in\\nChapter 6, Controls and Messages) include BCheckBox, BRadioButton, and\\nBPictureButton.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nStorage Kit\\nAll operating systems provide file system capabilities--without them, data couldn\\'t\\nbe saved to disk. The Storage Kit defines classes that allow your program to store\\ndata to files, search through stored data, or both.\\nThe BNode class is used to create an object that represents data on a disk. The\\nBFile class is a subclass of BNode. A BFile object represents a file on disk. Creating a BFile object opens a file, while deleting the same object closes the file. A\\nBFile object is the mechanism for reading and writing a file. The BDirectory\\nclass is another subclass of BNode. A BDirectory object represents a folder, and\\nallows a program to walk through the folder\\'s contents and create new files in the\\nfolder.\\nThe concept of file attributes, associating extra information with a given file,\\nallows for powerful file indexing and searching. The BQuery class is used to perform searches.\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nThe Support Kit, as its name suggests, supports the other kits. This kit defines\\nsome datatypes, constants, and a few classes. While the nature of the classes of the\\nSupport Kit makes a chapter devoted to it impractical, you will nonetheless\\nencounter a couple of this kit\\'s classes throughout this book.\\nThe BArchivable class defines a basic interface for storing an object in a message and instantiating a copy of that object from the message.\\nThe BLocker class is used to limit program access to certain sections of code.\\nBecause the BeOS is multithreaded, there is the possibility that a program will\\nattempt to access data from two different threads simultaneously. If both threads\\nattempt to write to the same location, results will be unpredictable. To avoid this,\\nprograms use the Lock() and Unlock() member functions to protect code. Calls\\nto these functions are necessary only under certain circumstances. Throughout this\\nbook mention of the use of Lock() and Unlock() will appear where required.\\n\\nMedia Kit\\nThe Media Kit is designed to enable programs to work with audio and video data\\nin real time--the kit classes provide a means for processing audio and video data.\\nThe Media Kit relies on nodes--specialized objects that perform media-related\\ntasks. A node is always indirectly derived from the BMediaNode class, and there\\nare several basic node types. Examples are producer and consumer nodes. A producer node sends output to media buffers, which are then received by consumer\\nnodes.\\n\\x0cOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\n\\n\\nMidi Kit\\nMIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a communication standard for representing musical data that is generated by digital musical devices. MIDI was created to define a way for computer software and electronic music equipment to\\nexchange information. The Midi Kit is a set of classes (such as BMidiPort) used\\nto assemble and disassemble MIDI messages. A MIDI message describes a musical\\nevent, such as the playing of a note. To make use of the Midi Kit classes, you\\'ll\\nneed to have prior knowledge of the MIDI software format.\\n\\nDevice Kit\\nThe Device Kit classes (such as BJoystick and BSerialPort) are used for the\\ncontrol of input and output devices and for the development of device drivers.\\nThese classes serve as interfaces to the ports on the back of a computer running\\nthe BeOS.\\n\\nNetwork Kit\\nThe Network Kit consists of a number of C functions. The C functions are global\\n(they can be used throughout your program), and exist to allow your program to\\ncommunicate with other computers using either the TCP or UDP protocols. One\\nsuch function is gethostbyname(), which is used to retrieve information about\\ncomputers attached to the user\\'s network.\\n\\nOpenGL Kit\\nOpenGL is a cross-platform application programming interface developed to facilitate the inclusion of interactive 2D and 3D graphics in computer programs. Introduced in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry standard for high-performance\\ngraphics. The OpenGL Kit contains classes that simplify the implementation of animation and three-dimensional modeling in your programs. The OpenGL Kit is one\\nof the newer BeOS kits, and is incomplete as of this writing. Working with the\\nOpenGL classes requires some previous experience with OpenGL.\\n\\nGame Kit\\nLike the OpenGL Kit, the Game Kit is incomplete. While it will eventually contain\\na number of classes that will aid in the development of games, at this time it\\nincludes just two classes. The BWindowScreen class is used by an application to\\ngain direct access to the screen in order to speed up the display of graphics. The\\nBDirectWindow class is an advanced class commonly used by game and media\\ndevelopers.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nKernel Kit\\nThe primary purpose of the C functions that make up the Kernel Kit is to support\\nthe use of threads. While the BeOS automatically spawns and controls many\\nthreads (such as the one resulting from the creation of a new window), your program can manually spawn and control its own threads. This kit includes classes\\nthat support semaphores for protecting information in the BeOS multithreaded\\nenvironment and shared memory areas for communicating between multiple\\nthreads and multiple applications.\\n\\nTranslation Kit\\nThe Translation Kit provides services that ease the work in translating data from\\none format to another. For instance, this kit could be used to translate the data in\\nan imported JPEG file into a BBitmap object (the BBitmap being a class defined in\\nthe Interface Kit) that your program could then manipulate.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\nThe classes (and in a few cases, the C functions and structures) that make up the\\nBeOS software kits serve any imaginable programming need, yet they share many\\nsimilarities. Becoming familiar with what makes up a software kit class definition\\nand how Be documents such a class will help you make use of all of the software\\nkits.\\n\\nContents of a Class\\nA Be software kit consists of classes. Each class can consist of member functions,\\ndata members, and overloaded operators. While a kit class will always have member functions, it isn\\'t required to (and very often doesn\\'t) have any data members\\nor operators.\\nData members\\nC++ programmers are used to creating classes that define a number of data members and a number of member functions. In the first few chapters of this book,\\nthough, you\\'ve read little about data members in Be classes. If a Be class does\\ndefine data members, they are usually defined to be private rather than public.\\nThese private data members will be used within class member functions, but\\nwon\\'t be used directly by your program\\'s objects. That is, a data member generally exists for use in the implementation of the class rather than for direct use by\\nyour program--data members are thus of importance to a class, but they\\'re almost\\nnever of importance to you.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nYou can see an example of the data members of a Be class by perusing the Be\\nheader files. In Chapter 1 you saw a snippet that consisted of a part of the\\nBWindow class. In the following snippet I\\'ve again shown part of this class. Here,\\nhowever, I\\'ve included the private keyword and some of the approximately\\nthree dozen data members that are a part of this class.\\nclass BWindow : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nBWindow(BRect frame,\\nconst char *title,\\nwindow_type type,\\nuint32 workspace = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE);\\n~BWindow();\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\n...\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nshort\\nport_id\\nport_id\\nBView\\nBView\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\nResizeBy(float dx, float dy);\\nResizeTo(float width, float height);\\nShow();\\nHide();\\nIsHidden() const;\\n\\n*fTitle;\\nserver_token;\\nfInUpdate;\\nf_active;\\nfShowLevel;\\nfFlags;\\nsend_port;\\nreceive_port;\\n*top_view;\\n*fFocus;\\n\\nMember functions\\nA class constructor and destructor are member functions, as are any class hook\\nfunctions. While the constructor, destructor, and hook functions are often\\ndescribed and discussed separately from other member functions, all fall into the\\ngeneral category of member functions, as shown in Figure 3-1.\\nFrom programming in C++ on other platforms, you\\'re familiar with constructors\\nand destructors. But you may not know about hook functions. A hook function is\\na member function that can be called directly by a program, but can also be (and\\nvery often is) invoked automatically by the system.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nSoftware Kit Class\\nData members\\nMember functions\\nHook functions\\nConstructor and destructor\\n\\nOther member functions\\n\\nOverloaded operators\\n\\nFigure 3-1. A kit class may consist of data members, member functions, and operators\\n\\nMany software kit class member functions are declared using the C++ keyword\\nvirtual. The most common reason for declaring a member function virtual is so\\nthat a derived class can override the function. Additionally, hook functions are\\ndeclared to be virtual for a second reason as well: your program may want to add\\nfunctionality to that which is already provided by the hook function.\\nWhen an application-defined class defines a member function, that function is typically invoked by an object created by the application. A hook function is also a\\nroutine defined by an application-defined class, but it is one that is invoked automatically by the software kit, not by an object. In order to be called by the system, a hook function must have a specific name that the system is aware of.\\nYou saw an example of a hook function in the SimpleApp example back in\\nChapter 1--the QuitRequested() function. When a window\\'s close button is\\nclicked on, the Be system automatically invokes a routine named\\nQuitRequested(). If the application has defined such a function in the BWindowderived class that the window object belongs to, it will be that member function\\nthat gets invoked. As a reminder, here\\'s the QuitRequested() function as defined\\nin the SimpleWindow class of the SimpleApp example:\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nA hook function is so named because the function serves as a place where you\\ncan \"hook\" your own code onto that of the Be-written software kit code. By\\nimplementing a hook function, your application in essence extends the functionality of the Be operating system. The system is responsible for calling a hook function, while your application is responsible for defining the functionality of that\\nfunction.\\nOverloaded operators\\nAlong with member functions and data members, you may find overloaded operators in a Be class. A few classes overload some of the C++ operators, but most\\nclasses don\\'t overload any. You\\'ll find that the need for a class to overload operators is usually intuitive. For instance, the BRect class overloads the comparison\\noperator (==) so that it can be used to test for the equality of two rectangle\\nobjects. Because the comparison operator is defined in C++ such that it can be\\nused to compare one number to another, the BRect class needs to rewrite its definition so that it can be used to test all four coordinates of one rectangle to the four\\ncoordinates of another rectangle.\\nAs you just saw for the BRect class, if it makes sense for a class to redefine a C++\\noperator, it will. For most other classes, the use of operators with objects doesn\\'t\\nmake sense, so there\\'s no need to overload any. For instance, the BWindow and\\nBView classes with which you\\'re becoming familiar don\\'t included any overloaded operators. After all, it wouldn\\'t be easy to test if one window is \"equal\" to\\nanother window.\\n\\nClass Descriptions and the Be Book\\nThe definitive source of information for the many classes that make up the BeOS\\nsoftware kits is the Be class reference by the programmers of the BeOS. The electronic versions of this document (you\\'ll find it in both HTML and Acrobat formats)\\ngo by the name of the Be Book, while the printed version is titled The Be Developer\\'s Guide (available from O\\'Reilly). After programming the BeOS for awhile,\\nyou\\'ll find the Be Book or its printed version indispensable. But now, as you take\\nyour first steps in programming the BeOS, you may find the voluminous size and\\nthe reference style of this book intimidating. While this one thousand or so page\\ndocument is comprehensive and well-written, it is a class reference, not a BeOS\\nprogramming tutorial. When you have a solid understanding of how classes are\\ndescribed in the Be Book you\\'ll be able to use the Be Book in conjunction with\\nthis text if you wish.\\nThe Be Book is organized into chapters. With the exception of the first chapter,\\nwhich is a short introduction to the BeOS, each chapter describes the classes of\\none kit. Chapter 2 covers the classes of the Application Kit, Chapter 3 describes\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe classes that make up the Storage Kit, and so forth. Each class description in a\\nchapter is itself divided into up to six sections: Overview, Data Members, Hook\\nFunctions, Constructor and Destructor, Member Functions, and Operators. If any\\none of these six sections doesn\\'t apply to the class being described, it is omitted\\nfrom the class description. For instance, the BWindow class doesn\\'t overload any\\noperators, so its class description doesn\\'t include an Operators section.\\nThe following list provides explanations of what appears in each of the six sections that may be present in a class description in the Be Book. For each software\\nkit class, the sections will appear in the order listed below, though some of the\\nsections may be omitted:\\nOverview\\nA class description begins with an overview of the class. Such information as\\nthe purpose of the class, how objects of the class type are used, and related\\nclasses may be present in this section. The overview will generally be short,\\nbut for significant classes (such as BWindow and BView), it may be several\\npages in length.\\nData Members\\nThis section lists and describes any public and protected data members\\ndeclared by the class. If a class declares only private data members (which is\\nusually the case), this section is omitted.\\nHook Functions\\nIf any of the member functions of a class serve as hook functions, they will be\\nlisted and briefly described in this section. This section serves to summarize\\nthe purpose of the class hook functions--a more thorough description of each\\nhook function appears in the Member Functions section of the class description. Many classes don\\'t define any hook functions, so this section will be\\nomitted from a number of class descriptions.\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nA class constructor and destructor are described in this section. A few classes\\ndon\\'t define a destructor (objects of such class types know how to clean up\\nand delete themselves). In such cases, this section will be named Constructor\\nrather than Constructor and Destructor.\\nMember Functions\\nThis section provides a detailed description of each of the member functions\\nof a class, except the class constructor and destructor (which have their own\\nsection). While class hook functions have their own section, that section\\nserves mostly as a list of hook functions--the full descriptions of such functions appear here in Member Functions. Every class consists of at least one\\nmember function, so this section is always present in a class description.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nOperators\\nHere you\\'ll find a description of any C++ operators a class overloads. Most\\nclassed don\\'t overload any operators, so this section is frequently absent from\\na class description.\\n\\nA BeOS Class Description: The BRect Class\\nNow that you\\'ve had a general look at how a class description appears in the Be\\nBook, you\\'ll want to see a specific example. Here I\\'ll look at the Be Book description of the BRect class. Because this class doesn\\'t have any hook functions, the\\nHook Functions section is omitted from the Be Book\\'s class description. If you\\'d\\nlike to see a specific example of how a class implements hook functions, refer to\\nthe \"A BeOS Class Description: The BWindow Class\" section in this chapter.\\nAs you read these pages, you may want to follow along in the electronic version\\nof the Be Book. If you do, double-click on the Chapter 4 document and scroll to\\nthe start of the BRect class description.\\nOverview\\nThe Overview section of the BRect class description informs you what a BRect\\nobject is (a rectangle) and how a BRect object is represented (by defining four\\ncoordinates that specify where the corners of the rectangle are located).\\nNext in this section is the object\\'s general purpose (to serve as the simplest specification of a two-dimensional area) and a few specific examples of what such an\\nobject is used for (to specify the boundaries of windows, scrollbars, buttons, and\\nso on). The BRect overview then provides the details of how your specification of\\na rectangle object\\'s boundaries affects the rectangle\\'s placement in a view.\\nAs you read the overview, notice that no BRect data members or BRect member\\nfunctions are mentioned by name. This is typical of a class Overview section; what\\na class object is used for is covered, but details of how to implement this usage\\naren\\'t. Such details are found in the descriptions of the appropriate functions in\\nthe Member Functions section.\\nData Members\\nThe BRect class is one of the few software kit classes that declares public data\\nmembers. So it is one of the few classes that includes a Data Members section.\\nHere you\\'ll find the names and datatypes of the four public data members (they\\'re\\nnamed left, top, right, and bottom, and each is of type float). A singlesentence description accompanies the listing of each data member. The specifics\\nof how these data members are used by a BRect object appear in discussions of\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe BRect constructor and member functions in the Constructor and Member\\nFunctions sections.\\nHook Functions\\nThe BRect class defines several member functions, but none of them serves as a\\nhook function, so no Hook Functions section appears in the BRect class description.\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nFor the BRect class, this section is named Constructor rather than Constructor and\\nDestructor. There is no BRect destructor, which implies that a BRect object\\nknows how to delete itself. The BRect class is somewhat atypical of kit classes in\\nthat it is more like a primitive datatype (such as an int or float) than a class.\\nThe primitive datatypes serve as the foundation of C++, and in the BeOS the\\nBRect class serves a somewhat similar purpose; is the basic datatype that serves as\\nthe foundation of Be graphics. BRect objects are declared in the same way primitive datatype variables are declared--there\\'s no need to use the new operator.\\nThere\\'s also no need to use the delete operator to destroy such objects.\\nThe Constructor section reveals that there are four BRect constructors. One common method of creating a rectangle is to use the constructor that accepts the four\\nrectangle coordinates as its parameters. The remainder of the Constructor section\\nof the BRect class description provides example code that demonstrates how each\\nof the four BRect constructors can be used.\\n\\nEach of the four BRect constructor functions is declared using the\\ninline keyword. As a C++ programmer, you may have encountered inline functions. If you haven\\'t, here\\'s a brief summary of this\\ntype of routine. Normally, when a function is invoked, a number of\\nnon-routine instructions are executed. These instructions ensure that\\ncontrol is properly moved from the calling function to the called\\nfunction and then back to the calling function. The execution time\\nfor these extra instructions is slight, so their inclusion is seldom a\\nconcern. If it does become an issue, though, C++ provides a mechanism for eliminating them--the inline keyword. The upside to the\\nuse of the inline keyword is that execution time decreases slightly.\\nThe downside is that this reduced time is achieved by adding more\\ncode to the executable. Declaring a function inline tells the compiler to copy the body of the function to the location at which the\\nfunction is called. If the function is called several times in a program, then its code appears several times in the executable.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nMember Functions\\nThis section lists each of the BRect member functions in alphabetical order. Along\\nwith the name and parameter list of any given function is a detailed description of\\nthe routine\\'s purpose and use. You\\'ve already seen one BRect member function\\nin action--the Set() function. In the Chapter 1 example, SimpleApp, a BRect\\nobject is created and assigned the values that define the rectangle used for the\\nboundaries of the SimpleApp program\\'s one window. The Member Functions section\\'s description of Set() states that the four parameters are used to assign values to the four BRect data members: left, top, right, and bottom.\\nOperators\\nThe BRect class overrides several C++ operators in order to redefine them so that\\nthey work with operations involving rectangles. In the Operators section, you see\\neach such operator listed, along with a description of how the overloaded operator is used. The operator you\\'ll use most often is probably the assignment operator (=). By C++ definition, this operator assigns a single number to a variable. Here\\nthe BRect class redefines the operator such that it assigns all four coordinates of\\none rectangle to the four coordinates of another rectangle. The Rect.h header file\\nprovides the implementation of the routine that redefines the assignment operator:\\ninline BRect &BRect::operator=(const BRect& from)\\n{\\nleft = from.left;\\ntop = from.top;\\nright = from.right;\\nbottom = from.bottom;\\nreturn *this;\\n}\\n\\nA BeOS Class Description: The BWindow Class\\nAfter reading the \"A BeOS Class Description: The BRect Class\" section of this chapter, you should have a good feel for how classes are described in the Be Book.\\nThe BRect class doesn\\'t include hook functions, though, so if you want to get a\\nlittle more information on this type of member function, read this section. The\\nBWindow class doesn\\'t define any public data members or overload any operators,\\nso you won\\'t find talk of a Data Members section or an Operators section here.\\nThe BRect class, however, does define public member functions and overload\\noperators. If you skipped the previous part, you may want to read it as well.\\nFollowing along in the Be Book isn\\'t a requirement, but it will be helpful. If you\\nhave access to the electronic version of the Be Book, double-click on the\\nChapter 4 document and scroll to the start of the BWindow class description.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nOverview\\nThe Overview section of the BWindow class description starts by telling you the\\noverall purpose of the BWindow class (to provide an application interface to windows) and the more specific purpose of this class (to enable one object to correspond to one window).\\nA class overview may mention other classes, kits, or servers that play a role in the\\nworkings of the described class. For instance, the BWindow overview mentions that\\nthe Application Server is responsible for allocating window memory and the\\nBView class makes drawing in a window possible.\\nBefore working with a class for the first time, you\\'ll want to read the Overview section to get, of course, an overview of what the class is all about. But you\\'ll also\\nwant to read the Overview section to pick up bits of information that may be of\\nvital interest to your use of the class. The BWindow overview, for instance, notes\\nthat there is a strong relationship between the BApplication class and the\\nBWindow class, and that a BApplication object must be created before the\\nfirst BWindow object is created. The overview also mentions that a newly created\\nBWindow object is hidden and must be shown using the Show() member function. You already knew these two facts from Chapter 1 of this book, but that chapter didn\\'t supply you with such useful information about each of the dozens of Be\\nsoftware kit classes!\\nData Members\\nLike most classes, the BWindow class doesn\\'t define any public data members, so\\nno Data Members section appears in the BWindow class description.\\nHook Functions\\nThe BWindow class has close to a dozen member functions that serve as hook\\nfunctions--routines that are invoked by the system rather than invoked by window objects. Here you find the names of the BWindow hook functions, along with\\na single-sentence description of each. A detailed description of each function,\\nalong with parameter types, appears in the Member Functions section.\\nMany of the short descriptions of the hook functions tell why the function can be\\nimplemented. For instance, the FrameMoved() hook function can be implemented to take note of the fact that a window has moved. Most programs won\\'t\\nhave to perform any special action if one of the windows is moved. If, however,\\nyour application does need to respond to a moved window, it can--thanks to the\\nFrameMoved() hook function. If your application implements a version of this\\nfunction, the movement of a window causes the system to automatically execute\\nyour program\\'s version of this routine.\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nSome classes have a constructor that includes a parameter whose value comes\\nfrom a Be-defined constant. In such cases the Be-defined constants will be listed\\nand described in the Constructor and Destructor section. For example, the third of\\nthe BWindow constructor\\'s several parameters has a value that comes from one of\\nseveral Be-defined constants. This window_type parameter specifies the type of\\nwindow to be created. Your application can use either the B_MODAL_WINDOW,\\nB_BORDERED_WINDOW, B_TITLED_WINDOW, or B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW constant in\\nthe creation of a BWindow object. In this Constructor and Destructor section you\\'ll\\nfind a description of each of these constants.\\nWhile a class destructor may be defined, objects of a kit class type often don\\'t\\nneed to explicitly call the object\\'s destructor when being destroyed. That\\'s because\\nthe BeOS does the work. The Constructor and Destructor section lets you know\\nwhen this is the case for a class. The BWindow class provides an example. As\\nstated in the Constructor and Destructor section of the BWindow class description,\\na BWindow object is destroyed by calling the BWindow member function Quit().\\nThis routine is responsible for using the delete operator on the window object and\\nthen invoking the BWindow destructor.\\nMember Functions\\nThis section describes each of the more than seventy member functions of the\\nBWindow class. You\\'ve worked with a couple of these routines, including the\\nShow() function, in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. If you look up Show() in the Member Functions, you\\'ll see that Show() is used to display a window--as you already\\nknow. Here you\\'ll also learn that this routine places the window in front of any\\nother windows and makes it the active window.\\nOperators\\nThe BWindow class doesn\\'t overload any C++ operators, so the Operators section is\\nomitted from the BWindow class description.\\n\\nChapter Example: Adding an Alert to\\nMyHelloWorld\\nEach remaining chapter in this book will include numerous code snippets that\\ndemonstrate the several topics presented in the chapter. The chapter will then\\nclose with the source code and a walk-through of a short but comprehensive\\nexample that exhibits many or all of the chapter topics. To keep new code to a\\nminimum and focus on only the new material presented in the chapter, each\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nexample program will be a modification of the MyHelloWorld program introduced in Chapter 2.\\nThis chapter provided an overview of the entire BeOS software kit layer, which\\nmakes including an example program relevant to the chapter a little difficult. Still,\\nI\\'d feel uncomfortable ending a chapter without at least a short exercise in adding\\ncode to a Be application! In this section, I first rearrange some of the code in the\\nMyHelloWorld listing to demonstrate that in Be programming--as in programming\\nfor any platform--there\\'s more than one means to accomplish the same goal. After\\nthat, I have the new version of MyHelloWorld open both its original window and\\na new alert by adding just a few lines of code to the MyHelloWorld.cpp listing.\\n\\nRevising MyHelloWorld\\nBy this point in your studies of Be programming, you should have enough of an\\nunderstanding of Be software kits, classes, and member functions that you feel\\ncomfortable making at least minimal changes to existing Be source code. While\\nyou\\'ll often start a new programming endeavor from an existing base of code,\\nyou\\'ll always need to adapt that code to make it fit your program\\'s needs. You\\nshould also be gaining enough of an understanding of Be code that you feel comfortable with the idea that there is more than one way to solve any programming\\ntask. As you look at the source code of existing Be applications, be aware that different programmers will write different code to achieve the same results.\\nIn this section I\\'ll rearrange some of the code in the MyHelloWindow.cpp and\\nMyHelloWorld.cpp source code files from the MyHelloWorld program introduced\\nin Chapter 2. Building a MyHelloWorld application from the modified listings will\\nresult in a program that behaves identically to the version built in Chapter 2.\\n\\nThe version of MyHelloWorld presented here will be used as the\\nbasis for each of the example programs in the remainder of this\\nbook. While there\\'s nothing tricky in the code presented here, you\\'ll\\nstill want to take a close look at it so that you can focus on only the\\nnew code that gets added in subsequent example programs.\\n\\nTwo approaches to achieving the same task\\nWhile I could just go ahead and make a few alterations for the sake of change, I\\'ll\\ninstead assume I have a valid reason for doing so! First, consider the Chapter 2\\nversion of MyHelloWorld. The MyHelloWindow class has a constructor that defines\\nan empty window. The MyHelloView class has a constructor that defines an\\nempty view and a Draw() member function that draws the string \"Hello, My\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nWorld!\" in that view. Recall that there is no connection between a window object\\ncreated from the MyHelloWindow class and a view object created from the\\nMyHelloView class until after the window object is created and the view object is\\nattached to it in the HelloApplication class constructor:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myWorld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nThe above approach is a good one for a program that allows for the opening of\\nwindows that differ--two windows could use two different views. If MyHelloWorld defined a second view class, then a second window of the\\nMyHelloWindow class type could be opened and an object of this different view\\ncould be attached to it.\\nNow consider a program that allows multiple windows to open, but these windows are initially to be identical. An example of such an application might be a\\ngraphics program that opens windows that each have the same tool palette along\\none edge. The palette could be a view object that consists of a number of icon\\nbuttons. Here it would make sense to use an approach that differs from the above.\\nFor such a program the view could be attached to the window in the window\\nclass constructor. That is, the code that is used to create a view and attach it to a\\nwindow could be moved from the application constructor to the window constructor. If I were to use this approach for the MyHelloWorld program, the previously\\nempty constructor for the MyHelloWindow class would now look like this:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld program, the MyHelloApplication constructor would\\nnow hold less code, and would look like the version shown here:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nNow, when a new window is created in the application constructor, the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is responsible for creating a new view, adding the\\nview to the new window, and then displaying the new window.\\nThe new MyHelloWorld source code\\nChanging the MyHelloWorld program to use this new technique results in changes\\nto two files: MyHelloWindow.cpp and MyHelloWorld.cpp. Here\\'s how MyHelloWindow.cpp looks now:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef _APPLICATION_H\\n#include <Application.h>\\n#endif\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_WINDOW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWindow.h\"\\n#endif\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nThe MyHelloWorld.cpp file doesn\\'t get any new code--it only gets code removed.\\nHere\\'s the new version of MyHelloWorld.cpp:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_WINDOW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWindow.h\"\\n#endif\\n// removed inclusion of MyHelloView.h header file\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_WORLD_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWorld.h\"\\n#endif\\nmain()\\n{\\nMyHelloApplication *myApplication;\\nmyApplication = new MyHelloApplication();\\nmyApplication->Run();\\ndelete(myApplication);\\n}\\n\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n// moved to MyHelloWindow constructor: MyHelloView variable declaration\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n// moved to MyHelloWindow constructor: the code to create view,\\n// attach it to window, and show window\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs is the case for all of this book\\'s examples, you\\'ll find a folder that holds the\\nfiles for this new version of MyHelloWorld on the included CD-ROM. Make sure to\\ncompile and build an application from the project file to convince yourself that\\nthis latest version of the MyHelloWorld executable is the same as the Chapter 2\\nversion.\\n\\nAdding an Alert to HelloWorld\\nThe Interface Kit defines classes for the common interface elements. There\\'s the\\nBWindow class for a window, the BMenuBar class for a menubar, the BMenu class\\nfor a menu, the BMenuItem class for a menu item, and so forth. When you want to\\nadd an interface element to a program, you rely on an Interface Kit class to create\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nan object that represents that element. Consider a program that is to include an\\nalert. Armed with the above knowledge, it\\'s a pretty safe guess that the Interface\\nKit defines a BAlert class to ease the task of creating alerts.\\nThe BAlert class description\\nThe BAlert class is a simple one: it consists of a constructor and a handful of\\nmember functions. The following is the BAlert class definition (less its private\\ndata members, which you won\\'t use) from the Alert.h header file:\\nclass BAlert : public BWindow\\n{\\npublic:\\nBAlert(const char *title,\\nconst char *text,\\nconst char *button1,\\nconst char *button2 = NULL,\\nconst char *button3 = NULL,\\nbutton_width width = B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL,\\nalert_type type = B_INFO_ALERT);\\nvirtual\\n\\n~BAlert();\\n\\nBArchivable\\nstatus_t\\n\\nBAlert(BMessage *data);\\n*Instantiate(BMessage *data);\\nArchive(BMessage *data, bool deep = true) const;\\n\\nvoid\\nchar\\n\\nSetShortcut(int32 button_index, char key);\\nShortcut(int32 button_index) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nGo();\\nGo(BInvoker *invoker);\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nBButton\\nBTextView\\n\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *an_event);\\nFrameResized(float new_width, float new_height);\\n*ButtonAt(int32 index) const;\\n*TextView() const;\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\n*ResolveSpecifier(BMessage *msg,\\nBMessage *specifier,\\nconst char *property);\\nGetSupportedSuites(BMessage *data);\\n\\nstatic\\n...\\n}\\n\\nBPoint\\n\\nAlertPosition(float width, float height);\\n\\nstatic\\nvirtual\\n\\nThe Overview section of the BAlert class description in the Be Book places\\nyou on familiar ground by letting you know that an alert is nothing more than\\na window with some text and one or more buttons in it. In fact, the overview\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nstates that you could forego the BAlert class altogether and use BWindow objects\\nin their place. You could do that, but you won\\'t want to. The BAlert class takes\\ncare of creating the alert window, establishing views within it, creating and displaying text and button objects in the alert, and displaying the alert upon creation.\\nThe Overview section tells you the two steps you need to take to display an alert:\\nconstruct a BAlert object using the new operator and the BAlert constructor,\\nthen invoke the Go() member function to display the new alert window.\\nThe Constructor section of the BAlert class description provides the details of the\\nvariable parameter list of the BAlert constructor. While the constructor can have\\nup to seven parameters, it can be invoked with fewer--only the first three parameters are required. Here\\'s the BAlert constructor:\\nBAlert(const char *title,\\nconst char *text,\\nconst char *button1,\\nconst char *button2 = NULL,\\nconst char *button3 = NULL,\\nbutton_width width = B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL,\\nalert_type type = B_INFO_ALERT);\\n\\nThe required parameters specify the alert\\'s title, its text, and a title for the alert\\'s\\nmandatory button. The first parameter is a string that represents the alert\\'s title.\\nWhile an alert doesn\\'t have a tab as an ordinary window does, a title is nonetheless required. The second parameter is a string that represents the text that is to\\nappear in the alert. The third parameter is a string (such as \"OK,\" \"Done,\" or\\n\"Accept\") that is to be used as the title of a button that appears in the alert. This\\nbutton is required so that the user has a means of dismissing the alert.\\nThe fourth through seventh parameters have default values assigned to them so\\nthat a call to the constructor can omit any or all of them. That is, an alert can be\\nconstructed by passing just three strings to the BAlert constructor--illustrated in\\nthis snippet:\\nBAlert\\n\\n*alert;\\n\\nalert = new BAlert(\"Alert\", \"Close the My Hello window to quit\", \"OK\");\\n\\nThe fourth and fifth parameters are optionally used for the text of up to two more\\nbuttons that will appear in the alert. The number of buttons in an alert varies\\ndepending on the number of strings passed to the BAlert constructor. By default,\\nthe second and third button titles are NULL, which tells BAlert to place only a single button in the alert. A Be-defined constant can be used as the sixth parameter\\nto BAlert(). This constant specifies the width of the alert\\'s buttons. By default,\\nthe width of each button will be a standard size (B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL) that is\\ncapable of holding most button titles. Providing a different constant here changes\\nthe width of each button. The final parameter specifies the icon to be displayed in\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe upper-left of the alert. By default a lowercase \"i\" (for \"information\") is used (as\\ndenoted by the Be-defined B_INFO_ALERT constant).\\nThe Alert program\\nIn the C03 folder on this book\\'s CD-ROM, you\\'ll find two folders: MyHelloWorld\\nand Alert. The MyHelloWorld folder holds the new version of the MyHelloWorld\\nproject--the version just described. The Alert folder also holds a version of the\\nMyHelloWorld project. The only difference between the two projects appears in\\nthe MyHelloApplication constructor in the MyHelloWorld.cpp file of the alert example. In the alert example, I\\'ve added four lines of code, shown in bold type here:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nBAlert\\n*alert;\\nlong\\nresult;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nalert = new BAlert(\"\", \"Close the My Hello window to quit.\", \"OK\");\\nresult = alert->Go();\\n}\\n\\nThis latest incarnation of MyHelloWorld will serve as the base from\\nwhich the remainder of this book\\'s examples are built. To make it\\neasy to recognize the code that doesn\\'t change from example to\\nexample (which is most of the code), I won\\'t rename the files and\\nclasses for each example. That means you\\'ll always find the familiar\\nMyHelloView, MyHelloWindow, and HelloApplication classes. As\\nexhibited in the above snippet, the differences between one version\\nof MyHelloWorld and another will consist of minimal code changes\\nor additions. My goal in this book is to present short examples that\\nconsist mostly of existing, thoroughly discussed code, with only a\\nminimum amount of new code. The new code will be, of course,\\ncode that is pertinent to the topic at hand. To distinguish one\\nMyHelloWorld project from the next, I\\'ll simply rename the project\\nfolder to something descriptive of the example. For instance, the\\nalert example discussed here appears in a folder titled Alert.\\n\\nIn the above call to BAlert(), the first parameter is an empty string that represents the alert\\'s title. An alert doesn\\'t have a tab as a window does, but a title is\\nrequired. Passing an empty string suffices here. The second parameter is a string\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nthat represents the text that is to appear in the alert. While this trivial example\\nexists only to show how the alert code integrates into a program, I did want the\\nalert to have at least some bearing on the program--so I\\'ve made the alert serve as\\na means of letting the user know how to quit the program. The final parameter is\\nthe name that appears on the alert\\'s button. For a one-button alert, OK is typically\\nused. Figure 3-2 shows what the alert example program looks like when running.\\n\\nFigure 3-2. An alert overlapping a window\\n\\x0c\\nWindows, Views, and\\nMessages\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Windows\\n Views\\n Messaging\\n\\n4.\\n\\nA window serves as a program\\'s means of communicating with the user. In order\\nto provide information to a user, a window needs to be able to draw either text or\\ngraphics. And in order to receive information from a user, a window needs to be\\naware of user actions such as mouse button clicks or key presses. Views make\\nboth these modes of communication possible. All drawing takes place in views.\\nAnd views are recipients of messages that are transmitted from the Application\\nServer to the program in response to user actions. All three of these topics--windows, views, and messages--can be discussed individually, and this chapter does\\njust that. To be of real use, though, the interaction of these topics must be\\ndescribed; this chapter of course does that as well.\\n\\nWindows\\nYour program\\'s windows will be objects of a class, or classes, that your project\\nderives from the BWindow class. The BWindow class is one of many classes in the\\nInterface Kit--the largest of the Be kits. Most other Interface Kit class objects draw\\nto a window, so they expect a BWindow object to exist--they work in conjunction\\nwith the window object.\\nBecause it is a type of BLooper, a BWindow object runs in its own thread and runs\\nits own message loop. This loop is used to receive and respond to messages from\\nthe Application Server. In this chapter\\'s \"Messaging\" section, you\\'ll see how a window often delegates the handling of a message to one of the views present in the\\nwindow. The ever-present interaction of windows, views, and messages accounts\\nfor the combining of these three topics in this chapter.\\n\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nWindow Characteristics\\nA window\\'s characteristics--its size, screen location, and peripheral elements\\n(close button, zoom button, and so forth)--are all established in the constructor of\\nthe BWindow-derived class of the window.\\nBWindow constructor\\nA typical BWindow-derived class constructor is often empty:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe purpose of the constructor is to pass window size and window screen location on to the BWindow constructor. In this next snippet, this is done by invoking\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor, using the BRect parameter frame as the first\\nargument in the BWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nIt is the BWindow constructor that does the work of creating a new window. The\\nfour BWindow constructor parameters allow you to specify the window\\'s:\\n\\n\\nSize and screen placement\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\nType or look\\n\\n\\n\\nBehavioral and peripheral elements\\n\\nThe BWindow constructor prototype, shown here, has four required parameters\\nand an optional fifth. Each of the five parameters is discussed following this prototype:\\nBWindow(BRect\\nconst char\\nwindow_type\\nulong\\nulong\\n\\nframe,\\n*title,\\ntype,\\nflags,\\nworkspaces = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE)\\n\\nWindow size and location (frame argument)\\nThe first BWindow constructor parameter, frame, is a rectangle that defines both\\nthe size and screen location of the window. The rectangle\\'s coordinates are relative to the screen\\'s coordinates. The top left corner of the screen is point (0, 0),\\nand coordinate values increase when referring to a location downward or\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nrightward. For instance, the lower right corner of a 640  480 screen has a screen\\ncoordinate point of (639, 479). Because the initialization of a BRect variable is\\nspecified in the order left, top, right, bottom; the following declaration results in a\\nvariable that can be used to create a window that has a top left corner fifty pixels\\nfrom the top of the user\\'s screen and seventy pixels in from the left of that screen:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nThe width of the window based on frame is determined simply from the delta of\\nthe first and third BRect initialization parameters, while the height is the difference between the second and fourth. The above declaration results in a rectangle\\nthat could be used to generate a window 301 pixels wide by 201 pixels high. (The\\n\"extra\" pixel in each direction is the result of zero-based coordinate systems.)\\nThe frame coordinates specify the content area of a window--the window\\'s title\\ntab is not considered. For titled windows, you\\'ll want to use a top coordinate of at\\nleast 20 so that none of the window\\'s title tab ends up off the top of the user\\'s\\nscreen.\\nIf your program creates a window whose size depends on the dimensions of the\\nuser\\'s screen, make use of the BScreen class. A BScreen object holds information about one screen, and the BScreen member functions provide a means for\\nyour program to obtain information about this monitor. Invoking Frame(), for\\ninstance, returns a BRect that holds the coordinates of the user\\'s screen. This next\\nsnippet shows how this rectangle is used to determine the width of a monitor:\\nBScreen\\nBRect\\n\\nmainScreen(B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID);\\nscreenRect;\\nscreenWidth;\\n\\nscreenRect = mainScreen->Frame();\\nscreenWidth = screenRect.right - screenRect.left;\\n\\nAs of this writing, the BeOS supports only a single monitor, but the above snippet\\nanticipates that this will change. The Be-defined constant B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID is\\nused to create an object that represents the user\\'s main monitor (the monitor that\\ndisplays the Deskbar). Additionally, the width of the screen can be determined by\\nsubtracting the left coordinate from the right, and the height by subtracting the top\\nfrom the bottom. On the main monitor, the left and top fields of the BRect\\nreturned by Frame() are 0, so the right and bottom fields provide the width\\nand height of this screen. When an additional monitor is added, though, the left\\nand top fields will be non-zero; they\\'ll pick up where the main screen \"ends.\"\\nWindow title\\nThe second BWindow constructor argument, title, establishes the title that is to\\nappear in the window\\'s tab. If the window won\\'t display a tab, this parameter\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nvalue is unimportant--you can pass NULL or an empty string (\"\") here (though\\nyou may want to include a name in case your program may eventually access the\\nwindow through scripting.\\nWindow type\\nThe third BWindow constructor parameter, type, defines the style of window to be\\ncreated. Here you use one of five Be-defined constants:\\nB_DOCUMENT_WINDOW\\nIs the most common type, and creates a nonmodal window that has a title tab.\\nAdditionally, the window has right and bottom borders that are thinner than\\nthe border on its other two sides. This narrower border is designed to integrate well with the scrollbars that may be present in such a window.\\nB_TITLED_WINDOW\\nResults in a nonmodal window that has a title tab.\\nB_MODAL_WINDOW\\nCreates a modal window, a window that prevents other application activity\\nuntil it is dismissed. Such a window is also referred to as a dialog box. A window of this type has no title tab.\\nB_BORDERED_WINDOW\\nCreates a nonmodal window that has no title tab.\\nB_FLOATING_WINDOW\\nCreates a window that floats above (won\\'t be obscured by) other application\\nwindows.\\n\\nThere\\'s another version of the BWindow constructor that has two\\nparameters (look and feel) in place of the one type parameter discussed above. The separate look and feel parameters provide a\\nmeans of more concisely stating just how a window is to look and\\nbehave. The single type parameter can be thought of as a shorthand\\nnotation that encapsulates both these descriptions. Refer to the\\nBWindow class section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for\\nmore details (and a list of Be-defined look and feel constants).\\n\\nWindow behavior and elements\\nThe fourth BWindow constructor argument, flags, determines a window\\'s behavior (such as whether the window is movable) and the window\\'s peripheral elements (such as the presence of a title tab or zoom button). There are a number of\\nBe-defined constants that can be used singly or in any combination to achieve the\\ndesired window properties. To use more than a single constant, list each and\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nseparate them with the OR (|) operator. The following example demonstrates how\\nto create a window that has no zoom button or close button:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, windowName, B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE | B_NOT_\\nCLOSABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nIf you use 0 (zero) as the fourth parameter, it serves as a shortcut for specifying\\nthat a window include all the characteristics expected of a titled window. Default\\nwindows are movable, resizable, and have close and zoom buttons:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, windowName, B_TITLED_WINDOW, 0)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe following briefly describes many of the several Be-defined constants available\\nfor use as the fourth parameter in the BWindow constructor:\\nB_NOT_MOVABLE\\nCreates a window that cannot be moved--even if the window has a title tab.\\nBy default, a window with a title tab is movable.\\nB_NOT_H_RESIZABLE\\nGenerates a window that can\\'t be resized horizontally. By default, a window\\ncan be resized both horizontally and vertically.\\nB_NOT_V_RESIZABLE\\nGenerates a window that can\\'t be resized vertically. By default, a window can\\nbe resized both horizontally and vertically.\\nB_NOT_RESIZABLE\\nCreates a window that cannot be resized horizontally or vertically.\\nB_NOT_CLOSABLE\\nResults in a window that has no close button. By default, a window with a\\ntitle tab has a close button.\\nB_NOT_ZOOMABLE\\nResults in a window that has no zoom box. By default, a window with a title\\ntab has a zoom box.\\nB_NOT_MINIMIZABLE\\nDefines a window that cannot be minimized (collapsed). By default, a window can be minimized by double-clicking on the window\\'s title bar.\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nB_WILL_ACCEPT_FIRST_CLICK\\nResults in a window that is aware of mouse button clicks in it--even when the\\nwindow isn\\'t frontmost. By default, a window is aware only of mouse button\\nclicks that occur when the window is the frontmost, or active, window.\\nWorkspace\\nThe BWindow constructor has an optional fifth parameter, workspaces, that specifies which workspace or workspaces should contain the new window. Desktop\\ninformation such as screen resolution and color depth (number of bits of color\\ndata per pixel) can be adjusted by the user. Different configurations can be saved\\nto different workspaces. Workspaces can be thought of as virtual monitors to\\nwhich the user can switch. Under different circumstances, a user may wish to display different types of desktops. By omitting this parameter, you tell the BWindow\\nconstructor to use the default Be-defined constant B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE. Doing\\nso means the window will show up in whatever workspace is currently selected\\nby the user. To create a window that appears in all of the user\\'s workspaces, use\\nthe Be-defined constant B_ALL_WORKSPACES as the fifth parameter to the BWindow\\nconstructor.\\n\\nYou can find out more about workspaces from the user\\'s perspective in the BeOS User\\'s Guide, and from the programmer\\'s perspective in the BWindow constructor section of the Interface Kit\\nchapter of the Be Book.\\n\\nAccessing Windows\\nFortunately for you, the programmer, the Be operating system takes care of much\\nof the work in keeping track of your application\\'s windows and the user\\'s actions\\nthat affect those windows. There will be times, however, when you\\'ll need to\\ndirectly manipulate one or all of your program\\'s windows. For instance, you may\\nwant to access the frontmost window to draw to it, or access all open windows to\\nimplement a Close All menu item.\\nThe Application Server keeps a list that holds references to an application\\'s open\\nwindows. The list indices begin at 0, and continue integrally. The windows aren\\'t\\nentered in this list in any predefined order, so you can\\'t rely on a particular index\\nreferencing a particular window. You can, however, use the BApplication member function WindowAt() to find any given window.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nAccessing a window using WindowAt()\\nWindowAt() accepts a single argument, an integer that serves as a window list\\nindex. Calling WindowAt() returns the BWindow object this index references. A\\ncall to WindowAt() returns the first window in the list:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\naWindow = be_app->WindowAt(0);\\n\\nFrom Chapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview, you know that the Be-defined global variable be_app always points to the active application, so you can use it anywhere in your code to invoke a BApplication member function such as\\nWindowAt().\\nWhen WindowAt() is passed a value that is an out-of-bounds index, the routine\\nreturns NULL. You can use this fact to create a simple loop that accesses each\\nopen window:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*theWindow;\\ni = 0;\\n\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\n// do something, such as close theWindow\\n}\\n\\nThe preceding loop starts at window 0 in the window list and continues until the\\nlast window in the list is reached.\\nA good use for the WindowAt() loop is to determine the frontmost window. The\\nBWindow member function IsFront() returns a bool (Boolean) value that indicates whether a window is frontmost. If you set up a loop to cycle through each\\nopen window and invoke IsFront() for each returned window, the frontmost\\nwindow will eventually be encountered:\\nBWindow\\nBWindow\\n\\n*theWindow;\\n*frontWindow = NULL;\\ni = 0;\\n\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nif (theWindow->IsFront())\\nfrontWindow = theWindow;\\n}\\n\\nIn the preceding snippet, note that frontWindow is initialized to NULL. If no windows are open when the loop runs, frontWindow will retain the value of NULL,\\nproperly indicating that no window is frontmost.\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nFrontmost window routine\\nWith the exception of main(), all the functions you\\'ve encountered to this point\\nhave been part of the BeOS API--they\\'ve all been Be-defined member functions\\nof Be-defined classes. Your nontrivial projects will also include application-defined\\nmember functions, either in classes you define from scratch or in classes you\\nderive from a Be-defined class. Here I provide an example of this second category of application-defined routine. The MyHelloApplication class is derived\\nfrom the Be-defined BApplication class. This version of MyHelloApplication\\nadds a new application-defined routine to the class declaration:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nBWindow *\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nGetFrontWindow();\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe function implementation is familiar to you--it\\'s based on the previous snippet that included a loop that repeatedly calls AtWindow():\\nBWindow * MyHelloApplication::GetFrontWindow()\\n{\\nBWindow *theWindow;\\nBWindow *frontWindow = NULL;\\ni = 0;\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nif (theWindow->IsFront())\\nfrontWindow = theWindow;\\n}\\nreturn frontWindow;\\n}\\n\\nWhen execution of GetFrontWindow() ends, the routine returns the BWindow\\nobject that is the frontmost window. Before using the returned window, typecast it\\nto the BWindow-derived class that matches its actual type, as in:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\n\\nWith access to the frontmost window attained, any BWindow member function can\\nbe invoked to perform some action on the window. Here I call the BWindow member function MoveBy() to make the frontmost window jump down and to the\\nright 100 pixels in each direction:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nFrontmost window example project\\nI\\'ve taken the preceding GetFrontWindow() routine and included it in a new version of MyHelloWorld. To test out the function, I open three MyHelloWorld windows, one directly on top of another. Then I call GetFrontWindow() and use the\\nreturned BWindow reference to move the frontmost window off the other two. The\\nresult appears in Figure 4-1.\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nMyHelloWindow *frontWindow;\\naWindow = new\\naWindow = new\\naWindow = new\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\n}\\n\\nFigure 4-1. The result of running the FrontWindow program\\n\\nNotice that before working with the returned window reference, I verify that it has\\na non-NULL value. If no windows are open when GetFrontWindow() is invoked,\\nthat routine returns NULL. In such a case, a call to a BWindow member function\\nsuch as MoveBy() will fail.\\nThe MyHelloWindow class doesn\\'t define any of its own member functions--it\\nrelies on BWindow-inherited functions. So in this example, I could have declared\\nfrontWindow to be of type BWindow and omitted the typecasting of the returned\\nBWindow reference. This code would still work:\\n...\\nBWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\n...\\nfrontWindow = GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\n}\\n\\nBut instead of working with the returned reference as a BWindow object, I opted to\\ntypecast it to a MyHelloWindow object. That\\'s a good habit to get into--the type\\nof window being accessed is then evident to anyone looking at the source code\\nlisting. It also sets up the returned object so that it can invoke any BWindowderived class member function. A BWindow object knows about only BWindow\\nfunctions, so if I define a SpinWindow() member function in the MyHelloWindow\\nclass and then attempt to call it without typecasting the GetFrontWindow()returned BWindow reference, the compiler will complain:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\nfrontWindow->SpinWindow();\\n\\n// compilation error at this line\\n\\nThe corrected version of the above snippet looks like this:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\nfrontWindow->SpinWindow();\\n// compiles just fine!\\n\\nWindows and Data Members\\nDefining a GetFrontWindow() or some similar member function to locate a window is one way to access a window. If you have only one instance of any given\\nwindow class in your program, though, you should consider using a technique\\nthat stores window references in data members in the application object.\\nDefining a window object data member in the application class\\nFor each type of window in your application, you can add to the class definition a\\nprivate data member of the window class type. Consider a program that displays\\ntwo windows: an input window for entering a mathematical equation, and an output window that displays a graph of the entered equation. If such a program\\ndefines BWindow-derived classes named EquationWindow and GraphWindow, the\\nBApplication-derived class could include two data members. As shown below,\\nBe convention uses a lowercase f as the first character of a data member name:\\nclass MathApp : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nMathApp();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n...\\nprivate:\\nEquationWindow\\nGraphWindow\\n\\n*fEquationWindow;\\n*fGraphWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld project, the MyHelloApplication class is defined as:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nStoring a window object in the data member\\nIn past examples, I created an instance of a window by declaring a local window\\nvariable in the application constructor, then using that variable in a call to the window\\'s class constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\n...\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nWith the new technique, there\\'s no need to use a local variable. Instead, assign the\\nobject returned by the window constructor to the window data member. The new\\nversion of the MyHelloApplication class defines an fMyWindow data member,\\nso the result would be:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nHere\\'s how the new version of the MyHelloApplication constructor looks:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nOnce created, the new window can be accessed from any application member\\nfunction. For instance, to jump the window across part of the screen requires only\\none statement:\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nWindow object data member example projects\\nThis chapter\\'s MyHelloWorld project consists of the new version of the\\nMyHelloApplication class--the version that includes an fMyWindow data member. The executable built from this project is indistinguishable from that built from\\nprior versions of the project; running the program results in the display of a single\\nwindow that holds the string \"Hello, My World!\"\\nThe WindowTester project picks up where MyHelloWorld leaves off. Like MyHelloWorld, it includes an fMyWindow data member in the MyHelloApplication\\nclass. The WindowTester version of the MyHelloApplication class also includes\\na new application-defined member function:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nDoWindowStuff();\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nAfter creating a window and assigning it to the fMyWindow data member, the\\nMyHelloApplication constructor invokes DoWindowStuff():\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nDoWindowStuff();\\n}\\n\\nI\\'ve implemented DoWindowStuff() such that it glides the program\\'s one window diagonally across the screen:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::DoWindowStuff()\\n{\\nfor (i=0; i<200; i++) {\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nFeel free to experiment by commenting out the code in\\nDoWindowStuff() and replacing it with code that has fMyWindow\\ninvoke BWindow member functions other than MoveBy(). Refer to\\nthe BWindow section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for\\nthe details on such BWindow member functions as Close(), Hide(),\\nShow(), Minimize(), ResizeTo(), and SetTitle().\\n\\nViews\\nA window always holds one or more views. While examples up to this point have\\nall displayed windows that include only a single view, real-world Be applications\\nmake use of windows that often consist of a number of views. Because all drawing must take place in a view, everything you see within a window appears in a\\nview. A scrollbar, button, picture, or text lies within a view. The topic of drawing\\nin views is significant enough that it warrants its own chapter--Chapter 5, Drawing. In this chapter, the focus will be on how views are created and accessed.\\nAdditionally, you\\'ll get an introduction to how a view responds to a message.\\nA view is capable of responding to a message sent from the Application Server to\\na BWindow object and then on to the view. This messaging system is the principle\\non which controls such as buttons work. The details of working with controls are\\nsaved for Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, but this chapter ends with a discussion of views and messages that will hold you over until you reach that chapter.\\n\\nAccessing Views\\nYou\\'ve seen that a window can be accessed by storing a reference to the window\\nin the BApplication-derived class (as demonstrated with the fMyWindow data\\nmember) or via the BeOS API (through use of the BApplication member function WindowAt()). A similar situation exists for accessing a view.\\nViews and data members\\nJust as a reference to a window can be stored in an application class data member, a reference to a view can be stored in a window class data member. The\\nMyHelloWorld project defines a single view class named MyHelloView that is\\nused with the project\\'s single window class, the MyHelloWindow class. Here I\\'ll\\nadd a MyHelloView reference data member to the MyHelloWindow class:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nvirtual bool\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nUsing this new technique, a view can be added to a new window in the window\\'s constructor, much as you\\'ve seen in past examples. The MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor creates a new view, and a call to the BWindow member function\\nAddChild() makes the view a child of the window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe window\\'s view can now be easily accessed and manipulated from any\\nMyHelloWindow member function.\\nView data member example projects\\nThis chapter\\'s NewMyHelloWorld project includes the new versions of the\\nMyHelloWindow class and the MyHelloWindow constructor--the versions developed above. Once again, performing a build on the project results in an executable that displays a single \"Hello, My World!\" window. This is as expected. Using a\\ndata member to keep track of the window\\'s one view simply sets up the window\\nfor easy access to the view--it doesn\\'t change how the window or view behaves.\\nThe ViewDataMember project serves as an example of view access via a data\\nmember--the fMyView data member that was just added to the NewMyHelloWorld project. Here\\'s how the ViewDataMember project defines the\\nMyHelloWindow class:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nSetHelloViewFont(BFont newFont, int32 newSize);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nThe difference between this project and the previous version is that this project\\nuses the newly added SetHelloViewFont() member function to set the type and\\nsize of the font used in a view. In particular, the project calls this routine to set the\\ncharacteristics of the font used in the MyHelloView view that the fMyView data\\nmember references. Here\\'s what the SetHelloViewFont() implementation looks\\nlike:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::SetHelloViewFont(BFont newFont, int32 newSize)\\n{\\nfMyView->SetFont(&newFont);\\nfMyView->SetFontSize(newSize);\\n}\\n\\nSetFont() and SetFontSize() are BView member functions with which you are\\nfamiliar--they\\'re both invoked from the MyHelloView AttachedToWindow()\\nfunction, and were introduced in Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects.\\nTo change a view\\'s font, SetHelloViewFont() is invoked by a MyHelloWindow\\nobject. To demonstrate its use, I chose to include the call in the MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBFont theFont = be_plain_font;\\nSetHelloViewFont(theFont, theSize);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe call to SetHelloViewFont() results in the about-to-be shown window having text characteristics that include a font type of plain and a font size of 12.\\nFigure 4-2 shows the results of creating a new window. While\\nSetHelloViewFont() is a trivial routine, it does the job of demonstrating view\\naccess and the fact that characteristics of a view can be changed at any time during a program\\'s execution.\\n\\nFigure 4-2. The ViewDataMember window displays text in a 12-point plain font\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nA More Practical Use For SetHelloViewFont()\\nAttaching a view to a window by calling AddChild() automatically invokes\\nthe view\\'s AttachedToWindow() routine to take care of any final view setup.\\nRecall that the MyHelloView class overrides this BView member function and\\ninvokes SetFont() and SetFontSize() in the AttachedToWindow() implementation:\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nSo it turns out that in the above version of the MyHelloWindow constructor,\\nthe view\\'s font information is set twice, almost in succession. The result is that\\nwhen the view is displayed, the last calls to SetFont() and SetFontSize()\\nare used when drawing in the view, as shown in Figure 4-2.\\nBecause this example project has very few member functions (intentionally, to\\nkeep it easily readable), I\\'m limited in where I can place a call to\\nSetHelloViewFont(). In a larger project, a call to SetHelloViewFont()\\nmight be invoked from the code that responds to, say, a button click or a menu\\nitem selection. After reading Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, Menus, you\\'ll be able to\\neasily try out one of these more practical uses for a routine such as\\nSetHelloViewFont().\\n\\nAccessing a view using FindView()\\nWhen a view is created, one of the arguments passed to the view constructor is a\\nstring that represents the view\\'s name:\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nThe MyHelloView class constructor invokes the BView constructor to take care of\\nthe creation of the view. When it does that, it in turn passes on the string as the\\nsecond argument, as done here:\\nMyHelloView::MyHelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nIf your code provides each view with a unique name, access to any particular\\nview can be easily gained by using the BWindow member function FindView().\\nFor instance, in this next snippet a pointer to the previously created view with the\\nname \"MyHelloView\" is being obtained. Assume that the following code is called\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nfrom within a MyHelloApplication member function, and that a window has\\nalready been created and a reference to it stored in the MyHelloApplication\\ndata member fMainWindow:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*theView;\\n\\ntheView = (MyHelloView *)fMainWindow->FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nFindView() returns a BView object. The above snippet typecasts this BView\\nobject to one that matches the exact type of view being referenced--a\\nMyHelloView view.\\nFindView() example project\\nThe FindByName project does just that--it finds a view using a view name. This\\nproject is another version of this chapter\\'s MyHelloWorld. Here I keep track of the\\nprogram\\'s one window using a data member in the MyHelloApplication class. A\\nreference to the program\\'s one view isn\\'t, however, stored in a data member in the\\nMyHelloWindow class. Instead, the view is accessed from the window using a call\\nto FindView(). Here\\'s the MyHelloWindow constructor that creates a view named\\n\"MyHelloView\" and adds it to a new window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow member function QuitRequested() has remained\\nunchanged since its introduction in Chapter 1. All it did was post a B_QUIT_\\nREQUESTED and return true. I\\'ll change that by adding a chunk of code.\\nFigure 4-3 shows how the program\\'s window looks just before closing.\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nbigtime_t\\nmicroseconds = 1000000;\\naView = (MyHelloView *)FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\nif (aView) {\\naView->DrawString(\"Quitting...\");\\naView->Invalidate();\\n}\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n\\n}\\n\\nFigure 4-3. The FindByName program adds text to a window before closing it\\n\\nThe new version of QuitRequested() now does the following:\\n\\n\\nAccesses the view named \"MyHelloView.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCalls a few BView member functions to draw a string and update the view.\\n\\n\\n\\nPauses for one second.\\n\\n\\n\\nCloses the window and quits.\\n\\nSeveral lines of code are worthy of further discussion.\\nThe \"Accessing a view using FindView()\" section in this chapter demonstrates the\\nuse of FindView() from an existing window object:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*theView;\\n\\ntheView = (MyHelloView *)fMainWindow->FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nThis latest example demonstrates the use of FindView() from within a window\\nmember function. The specific object FindView() acts on is the one invoking\\nQuitRequested(), so unlike the above example, here no MyHelloWindow object\\nvariable precedes the call to FindView():\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = (MyHelloView *)FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nWith a reference to the MyHelloView object, QuitRequested() can invoke any\\nBView member function. MovePenTo() and DrawString() are functions you\\'ve\\nseen before--they also appear in the MyHelloView member function Draw().\\nInvalidate() is new to you. When a view\\'s contents are altered--as they are\\nhere with the writing of the string \"Quitting...\"--the view needs to be updated\\nbefore the changes become visible onscreen. If the changes are made while the\\nview\\'s window is hidden, then the subsequent act of showing that window brings\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\non the update. Here, with the window showing and frontmost, no update automatically occurs after the call to DrawString(). The BView member function\\nInvalidate() tells the system that the current contents of the view are no longer\\nvalid and require updating. When the system receives this update message, it\\nimmediately obliges the view by redrawing it.\\nFinally, the snooze() function is new to you. The BeOS API includes a number of\\nglobal, or nonmember, functions--snooze() is one of them. A global function\\nisn\\'t associated with any class or object, so once the BApplication-defined object\\nis created in main(), it can be called from any point in a program. The snooze()\\nfunction requires one argument, the number of microseconds for which execution\\nshould pause. The parameter is of type bigtime_t, which is a typedef equivalent to the int64 datatype. Here, the first call to snooze() pauses execution for\\none million microseconds, or one second, while the second call pauses execution\\nfor fifty thousand microseconds, or one-twentieth of one second:\\nbigtime_t\\n\\nmicroseconds = 1000000;\\n\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n\\nIn this book I\\'ll make occasional use of a few global functions. In\\nparticular, you\\'ll see calls to snooze() and beep() in several examples. You\\'ll quickly recognize a function as being global because it\\nstarts with a lowercase character. A global function is associated with\\none of the Be kits, so you\\'ll find it documented in the Global Functions section of the appropriate kit chapter in the Be Book. For\\ninstance, snooze() puts a thread to sleep, so it\\'s documented in\\nthe thread-related chapter of the Be Book, the Kernel Kit chapter.\\nThe beep() global function plays the system beep. Sound (and thus\\nthe beep() function) is a topic covered in the Media Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book.\\n\\nView Hierarchy\\nA window can hold any number of views. When a window holds more than one,\\nthe views fall into a hierarchy.\\nTop view\\nEvery window contains at least one view, even if none is explicitly created and\\nadded with calls to AddChild(). That\\'s because upon creation, a window is\\nalways automatically given a top view--a view that occupies the entire content\\narea of the window. Even if the window is resized, the top view occupies the\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nentire window content. A top view exists only to serve as an organizer, or container, of other views. The other views are added by the application. Such an\\napplication-added view maps out a window area that has its own drawing characteristics (such as font type and line width), is capable of being drawn to, and is\\nable to respond to messages.\\nApplication-added views and the view hierarchy\\nEach view you add to the window falls into a window view hierarchy. Any view\\nthat is added directly to the window (via a call to the BWindow member function\\nAddChild()) falls into the hierarchy just below the top view. Adding a few views\\nto a window in this way could result in a window and view hierarchy like those\\nshown in Figure 4-4.\\n\\nTop\\nView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-4. A window with three views added to it and that window\\'s view hierarchy\\n\\nWhen a view is added to a window, there is no visible sign that the\\nview exists. So in Figure 4-4, the window\\'s views--including the top\\nview--are outlined and are named. The added views have also been\\ngiven a light gray background. While the view framing, shading, and\\ntext have been added for clarity, you could in fact easily create a\\nwindow that highlighted its views in this way. You already know\\nhow to add text to a view using DrawString(). Later in this chapter you\\'ll see how to draw a rectangle in a view. And in Chapter 5\\nyou\\'ll see how to change the background color of a view.\\n\\nThe views you add to a window don\\'t have to exist on the same hierarchical level;\\nthey can be nested one inside another. Figure 4-5 shows another window with\\nthree views added to the top view. Here, one view has been placed inside\\nanother.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nTop\\nView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-5. A window with nested views added to it and that window\\'s view hierarchy\\n\\nTo place a view within another, you add the view to the container view rather\\nthan to the window. Just as the BWindow class has an AddChild() member function, so does the BView class. This next snippet shows a window constructor that\\ncreates two views. The first is 200 pixels by 300 pixels in size, and is added to the\\nwindow. The second 150 pixels by 150 pixels, and is added to the first view.\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Nested Views\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nBRect\\nviewFrame;\\nview1 = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MyFirstView\");\\nview2 = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MySecondView\");\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nMultiple views example project\\nLater in this chapter you\\'ll see a few example projects that place two views of type\\nMyHelloView in a window. Having the views be the same type isn\\'t required, of\\ncourse--they can be different class types. The TwoViewClasses project defines a\\nview named MyDrawView and adds one such view to a window, along with an\\ninstance of the MyHelloView class with which you\\'re already familiar. Figure 4-6\\nshows the window that results from running the TwoViewClasses program.\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-6. A window that holds two different types of views\\n\\nIn keeping with the informal convention of placing the code for a class declaration in its own header file and the code for the implementation of the member\\nfunctions of that class in its own source code file, the TwoViewClasses project\\nnow has a new source code file added to it. Figure 4-7 shows the project window\\nfor this project.\\n\\nFigure 4-7. The TwoViewClasses project window shows the addition of a new source code file\\n\\nI haven\\'t shown a project window since Chapter 2, and won\\'t show\\none again. I did it here to lend emphasis to the way in which\\nprojects are set up throughout this book (and by many other Be programmers as well).\\n\\nI created the new class by first copying the MyHelloView.h and MyHelloView.cpp\\nfiles and renaming them to MyDrawView.h and MyDrawView.cpp, respectively. My\\nintent here is to demonstrate that a project can derive any number of classes from\\nthe BView class and readily mix them in any one window. So I\\'ll only make a couple of trivial changes to the copied MyHelloView class to make it evident that this\\nis a new class. In your own project, the BView-derived classes you define may be\\nvery different from one another.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nWith the exception of the class name and the name of the constructor, the\\nMyDrawView class declaration is identical to the MyHelloView class declaration.\\nFrom the MyDrawView.h file, here\\'s that declaration:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\nLike the MyHelloView constructor, the MyDrawView constructor is empty:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyDrawView member function AttachedToWindow() sets up the view\\'s font\\nand font size. Whereas the MyHelloView specified a 12-point font, the\\nMyDrawView specifies a 24-point font:\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nExcept for the text drawn to the view, the MyDrawView member function Draw()\\nlooks like the MyHelloView version of this function:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\nDrawString(\"This is a MyDrawView view\");\\n}\\n\\nTo create a further contrast in the way the two views display text, I turned to the\\nMyHelloView and made one minor modification. In the AttachedToWindow()\\nmember function of that class, I changed the font set by SetFont() from be_\\nbold_font to be_plain_font. Refer to Figure 4-6 to see the difference in text\\nappearances in the two views.\\nIn order for a window to be able to reference both of the views it will hold, a new\\ndata member has been added to the MyHelloWindow class. In the MyHelloWindow.h header file, you\\'ll find the addition of a MyDrawView data member named\\nfMyDrawView:\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fMyDrawView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIn the past the MyHelloWindow constructor created and added a single view to\\nitself. Now the constructor adds a second view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfMyDrawView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyDrawView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nBoth views have been added directly to the window (to the top view), rather than\\nto another view, so both views are on the same level in the window\\'s view hierarchy. The Draw() function of each view type includes code to frame the view, so\\nyou can easily see the results of any view size changes you might make to the\\nviews here in the MyHelloWindow constructor.\\n\\nCoordinate System\\nIn order to specify where a window is to be placed on the screen and where a\\nview is to be placed within a window, a coordinate system is required.\\nGlobal coordinate system\\nTo allow a programmer to reference any point on the computer screen, Be defines\\na coordinate system that gives every pixel a pair of values: one for the pixel\\'s distance from the left edge of the screen and one for the pixel\\'s distance from the top\\nof the screen. Figure 4-8 points out a few pixels and their corresponding coordinate pairs.\\nFor display devices, the concept of fractional pixels doesn\\'t apply. Consider a window that is to have its top left corner appear 100 pixels from the left edge of the\\nscreen and 50 pixels from the top of the screen. This point is specified as (100.0,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nx-axis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny-axis\\nFigure 4-8. The global coordinate system maps the screen to a two-dimensional graph\\n\\n50.0). If the point (100.1, 49.9) is used instead, the result is the same--the window\\'s corner ends up 100 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the top of the\\nscreen.\\nThe above scenario begs the question: if the coordinates of pixel locations are simply rounded to integral values, why use floating points at all? The answer lies in\\nthe current state of output devices: most printers have high resolutions. On such a\\ndevice, one coordinate unit doesn\\'t map to one printed dot. A coordinate unit is\\nalways 1/72 of an inch. If a printer has a resolution of 72 dots per inch by 72 dots\\nper inch (72 dpi  72 dpi), then one coordinate unit would in fact translate to one\\nprinted dot. Typically printers have much higher resolutions, such as 300 dpi or\\n600 dpi. If a program specifies that a horizontal line be given a height of 1.3 units,\\nthen that line will occupy one row of pixels on the screen (the fractional part of\\nthe line height is rounded off). When that same line is sent to a printer with a resolution of 600 dpi, however, that printer will print the line with a height of 11\\nrows. This value comes from the fact that one coordinate unit translates to 8.33\\ndots (that\\'s 1/72 of 600). Here there is no rounding of the fractional coordinate\\nunit, so 1.3 coordinate units is left at 1.3 units (rather than 1 unit) and translates to\\n11 dots (1.3 times 8.33 is 10.83). Whether the line is viewed on the monitor or on\\nhardcopy, it will have roughly the same look--it will be about 1/72 inch high. It\\'s\\njust that the rows of dots on a printer are denser than the rows of pixels on the\\nmonitor.\\nWindow coordinate system\\nWhen a program places a view in a window, it does so relative to the window,\\nnot to the screen. That is, regardless of where a window is positioned on the\\nscreen when the view is added, the view ends up in the same location within the\\ncontent area of the window. This is possible because a window has its own\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\ncoordinate system--one that\\'s independent of the global screen coordinate system. The type of system is the same as the global system (floating point values that\\nget larger as you move right and down)--but the origin is different. The origin of\\na window\\'s coordinate system is the top left corner of the window\\'s content area.\\nWhen a program adds a view to a window, the view\\'s boundary rectangle values\\nare stated in terms of the window\\'s coordinate system. Consider the following window constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nBRect\\naView = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe coordinate systems for the window and the view are different. The window\\'s\\nsize and screen placement, which are established by the BRect variable frame\\nthat is passed to the constructor, are expressed in the global coordinate system.\\nThe view\\'s size and placement, established by the local BRect variable\\nviewFrame, are expressed in the window coordinate system. Regardless of where\\nthe window is placed, the view aView will have its top left corner at point (20.0,\\n30.0) within the window.\\n\\nIn all previous examples, the arguments to a BRect constructor, or\\nto the BRect member function Set(), were integer values, such as\\n(20, 30, 120, 130). Since none of the examples were concerned with\\nhigh precision printouts, that technique worked fine. It also may\\nhave been comforting to you if you come from a Mac or Windows\\nprogramming background, where rectangle boundaries use integral\\nvalues. Now that we\\'ve seen the true nature of the BeOS coordinate\\nsystem, however, we\\'ll start--and continue--to use floating point\\nvalues.\\n\\nView coordinate system\\nWhen a program draws in a view, it draws relative to the view, not to the window or the screen. It doesn\\'t matter where a window is onscreen, or where a view\\nis within a window--the drawing will take place using the view\\'s own coordinate\\nsystem. Like the global and window coordinate systems, the view coordinate system is one of floating point coordinate pairs that increase in value from left to right\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nand from top to bottom. The origin is located at the top left corner of the view.\\nConsider this version of the MyHelloView member function Draw():\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n}\\n\\nThe arguments in the call to the BView member function MovePenTo() are local\\nto the view\\'s coordinate system. Regardless of where the view is located within its\\nwindow, text drawing will start 10 units in from the left edge of the view and 30\\nunits down from the top edge of the view.\\nFigure 4-9 highlights the fact that there are three separate coordinate systems at\\nwork in a program that displays a window that holds a view.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-9. The screen, windows, and views have their own coordinate systems\\n\\nCoordinate system example projects\\nTo determine the size of a view in its own coordinate system (whether the view\\nresides in a window or within another view), begin by invoking the BView member function Bounds(). In this chapter\\'s OneView project, a call to this function\\nhas been added to the MyHelloView member function Draw(). One other BView\\nmember function call has been added too--a call to StrokeRect(). This routine\\ndraws a rectangle at the coordinates specified by the BRect argument passed to it:\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n\\n}\\n\\nSince the rectangle returned by the Bounds() function call is relative to the view\\'s\\nown coordinate system, the left and top fields are always 0.0. The right and\\nbottom fields reveal the view\\'s width and height, respectively.\\nTo find a view\\'s boundaries relative to the window or view it resides in, call the\\nBView member function Frame(). The rectangle returned by a call to Frame()\\nhas left and top fields that indicate the view\\'s distance in and down from the\\nwindow or view it resides in.\\nThe OneView project creates a single MyHelloView view and adds it to a window. These steps take place in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nNow that you know about the different coordinate systems, setting up the view\\nrectangle might make more sense to you. In the above snippet, the BRect parameter frame holds the coordinates of the window. These coordinates directly define\\nthe screen placement of the window and indirectly define the size of the window\\n(subtract frame.left from frame.right to get the window\\'s width, and subtract frame.top from frame.bottom to get the window\\'s height). Calling the\\nBRect member function OffsetTo() with B_ORIGIN as the parameter shifts these\\ncoordinates so that each of the frame.left and frame.top fields has a value of\\n0.0. The overall size of the frame rectangle itself, however, doesn\\'t change--it is\\nstill the size of the window. It just no longer reflects the screen positioning of the\\nwindow. Next, the view that is to be added to the window is created. The view is\\nto be positioned in the window using the window\\'s coordinate system, so if the\\nview is to fit snugly in the window, the view must have its top left corner at the\\nwindow\\'s origin. The frame rectangle that was initially used to define the placement and size of the window can now be used to define the placement and size\\nof the view that is to fill the window.\\nWhen the BWindow member function Show() is invoked from the window constructor, the window is drawn to the screen and the view\\'s Draw() function is\\nautomatically called to update the view. When that happens, the view is outlined--the Draw() function draws a line around the perimeter of the view.\\nFigure 4-10 shows the result of creating a new window in the OneView project.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nBecause the window\\'s one view is exactly the size of the content area of the window, the entire content area gets a line drawn around it.\\n\\nFigure 4-10. Drawing a rectangle around the OneView window\\'s view\\n\\nThe OneSmallView project is very similar to the OneView project--both draw a\\nframe around the one view that resides in the program\\'s window. To demonstrate\\nthat a view doesn\\'t have to occupy the entire content area of a window, the OneSmallView project sets up the view\\'s boundary rectangle to be smaller than the\\nwindow. This is done in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHere the line that offsets the window boundary rectangle (the BRect parameter\\nframe) has been replaced by one that calls the BRect member function Set() to\\nreset all the values of the frame rectangle. Figure 4-11 shows the resulting window. Note that a view is aware of its own boundaries, so that when you try to\\ndraw (or write) beyond a view edge, the result is truncated.\\n\\nFigure 4-11. When a view is too small for the window content\\n\\nMessaging\\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the Application Server communicates with (serves) an\\napplication by making the program aware of user actions. This communication is\\ndone in the form of system messages sent from the server to the application. Mes-\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nsages are received by a window and, often, passed on to a view in that window.\\nThe BeOS shoulders most of the responsibility of this communication between the\\nApplication Server, windows, and views. Your application (typically a view in a\\nwindow in your application) is responsible for performing some specific action in\\nresponse to a message.\\n\\nSystem Messages\\nA system message is sent from the Application Server to a BLooper object. Both\\nthe BApplication and BWindow classes are derived from BLooper, so objects of\\nthese two classes (or objects of classes derived from these two classes) can receive\\nmessages. The Application server is responsible for directing a system message to\\nthe appropriate type of object.\\nThe message loop of a program\\'s BWindow-derived object receives messages that\\nhold information about user actions. If the user typed a character, that character\\nmay need to be entered into a window. If the user clicked a mouse button, that\\nclick may have been made while the cursor was over a button in the window. The\\nsystem message types of these two user actions are B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN. Such BWindow-directed system messages are referred to as interface messages.\\nThe message loop of a program\\'s BApplication-derived object receives messages that pertain to the application itself (as opposed to messages that pertain to\\na window or view, which are sent to a BWindow-derived object). If the user\\nchooses the About menu item present in most programs, the program dispatches\\nto the application object a message of type B_ABOUT_REQUESTED. Such\\nBApplication-directed system messages are referred to as application messages.\\n\\nSee the Application Kit chapter of the Be Book for a description of\\nall of the application messages, and the Interface Kit chapter for a\\ndescription of all the interface messages.\\n\\nSystem message dispatching\\nWhen a system message reaches a looper object (such as the application object or\\na window object), that object handles, or dispatches, the message by automatically invoking a virtual hook function. Such a function is declared virtual so that\\nyour own derived classes can override it in order to reimplement it to match your\\nprogram\\'s specific needs. In that sense, you\\'re \"hooking\" your own code onto the\\nsystem code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nEach system message has a corresponding hook function. For the three system\\nmessages mentioned above (B_ABOUT_REQUESTED, B_KEY_DOWN, and B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN), those functions are AboutRequested(), KeyDown(), and MouseDown().\\nThe application object itself handles a B_ABOUT_REQUESTED message by calling\\nthe BApplication member function AboutRequested(). A window object, on\\nthe other hand, passes a B_KEY_DOWN or B_MOUSE_DOWN message on to the particular view object to which the message pertains. This view object then invokes the\\nBView member function KeyDown() or MouseDown() to handle the message.\\nTypes of hook functions\\nFor some system messages, the hook function defined by the Be class takes care\\nof all the work suggested by the message. For instance, a click on a window\\'s\\nzoom button results in a B_ZOOM message being sent to the affected window. The\\nreceiving of this message automatically brings about the execution of the BWindow\\nmember function Zoom(). This hook function is fully implemented, meaning that\\nyou need to add no code to your project in order to support a click in a window\\'s zoom button.\\nAll hook functions are declared virtual, so your code can override even fully\\nimplemented ones. Unless your application needs to perform some nonstandard\\naction in response to the message, though, there\\'s no need to do so.\\nFor other system messages, the hook function is implemented in such a way that\\nthe most common response to the message is handled. A program may override\\nthis type of hook function and reimplement it in such a way that the new version\\nhandles application-specific needs. This new application-defined version of the\\nhook function may also call the original Be-defined BView version of the routine\\nin order to incorporate the default actions of that BView version. An example of\\nthis type of hook function is ScreenChanged(), which is invoked in response to\\na B_SCREEN_CHANGED message. When the user changes the screen (perhaps by\\naltering the monitor resolution), the application may need to make special adjustments to an open window. After doing that, the application-defined version of\\nScreenChanged() should invoke the BView-defined version of this routine so\\nthat the standard screen-changing code that\\'s been supplied by Be can execute\\ntoo.\\nFinally, for some system messages, the hook function implementation is left to the\\napplication. If an application is to respond to user actions that generate messages\\nof types such as B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_DOWN, that application needs to override BView hook functions such as KeyDown() and MouseDown().\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nInterface messages\\nA system message directed at the application object is an application message,\\nwhile a system message directed at a window object is an interface message.\\nResponding to user actions is of great importance to a user-friendly application, so\\nthe remainder of this chapter is dedicated to illustrating how a project goes about\\ndoing this. In particular, I\\'ll discuss the handling of two of the interface messages\\n(B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_DOWN). Summarized below are several of the interface messages; refer to the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for a description\\nof each of the 18 message types.\\nB_KEY_DOWN\\nGoes to the active window in response to the user pressing a character key.\\nThe recipient window invokes the BView hook function KeyDown() of the\\naffected view. The affected view is typically one that accepts text entry, such\\nas a view of the yet-to-be-discussed BTextControl or BTextView classes. An\\nexample of handling a B_KEY_DOWN message is presented later in this chapter.\\nB_KEY_UP\\nIs sent to the active window when the user releases a pressed character key.\\nThe recipient window invokes the BView hook function KeyUp() of the\\naffected view. Typically, a program responds to a B_KEY_DOWN message and\\nignores the B_KEY_UP message that follows. In other words, the program\\ndoesn\\'t override the BView hook function KeyUp().\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\nIs sent to the window over which the cursor was located at the time of the\\nmouse button click. The window that receives the message calls the BView\\nhook function MouseDown() of the view the cursor was over at the time of\\nthe mouse button click.\\nB_MOUSE_UP\\nReaches the window that was affected by a B_MOUSE_DOWN message when the\\nuser releases a pressed mouse button. The MouseDown() hook function that\\nexecutes in response to a B_MOUSE_DOWN message often sufficiently handles a\\nmouse button click, so a B_MOUSE_UP message is often ignored by a program. That is, the program doesn\\'t override the BView hook function\\nMouseUp().\\nB_MOUSE_MOVED\\nIs sent to a window when the user moves the cursor over the window. As the\\nuser drags the mouse, repeated B_MOUSE_MOVED messages are issued by the\\nApplication Server. As the cursor moves over one window to another, the window to which the messages are sent changes. When the mouse is moved over\\nthe desktop rather than a window, a B_MOUSE_MOVED message is sent to the\\nDesktop window of the Tracker.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nMouse Clicks and Views\\nWhen a window receives a B_MOUSE_DOWN message from the Application Server,\\nthe window object (without help from you) determines which of its views should\\nrespond. It is that view\\'s MouseDown() hook function that is then invoked.\\nThe ViewsMouseMessages project includes a MouseDown() routine with the\\nMyHelloView class in order to make the program \"mouse-click aware.\" The\\nViewsMouseMessages program displays a single window that holds two framed\\nMyHelloView views. Clicking the mouse while the cursor is over either view\\nresults in the playing of the system beep.\\nThe mechanism for responding to a mouse click has already been present in every\\nexample project in this book, so there\\'s very little new code in the ViewsMouseMessages project. The ViewsMouseMessages program, and every other program\\nyou\\'ve seen in this book, works as follows: when the user clicks the mouse button while the cursor is over a window, the Application Server sends a B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN message to the affected window, causing it to invoke the affected view\\'s\\nMouseDown() hook function. The MyHelloView class is derived from the BView\\nclass, and the BView class defines its version of MouseDown() as an empty function. So unless the MyHelloView class overrides MouseDown(), it inherits this \"donothing\" routine. In all previous examples, a mouse button click while the cursor\\nwas over a view resulted in the execution of this empty routine--so effectively the\\nmouse button click was ignored. The ViewsMouseMessages project overrides\\nMouseDown() so that a mouse button click with the cursor over a view now\\nresults in something happening. Here\\'s the latest version of the MyHelloView\\nclass definition, with the addition of the MouseDown() declaration:\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe one MouseDown() parameter is a BPoint that is passed to the routine by the\\nApplication Server. This point parameter holds the location of the cursor at the\\ntime the mouse button was clicked. The values of the point are in the view\\'s coordinate system. For example, if the cursor was over the very top left corner of the\\nview at the time of the mouse click, the point\\'s coordinates would be close to (0.0,\\n0.0). In other words, both point.x and point.y would have a value close to 0.0.\\nTo verify that the B_MOUSE_DOWN message has worked its way to the new version\\nof MouseDown(), the implementation of MouseDown() sounds the system beep:\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n}\\n\\nRecall that beep() is a global function that, like the snooze() routine covered\\nearlier in this chapter, can be called from any point in your project\\'s source code.\\n\\nKey Presses and Views\\nIn response to a B_MOUSE_DOWN message, a window object invokes the\\nMouseDown() function of the affected view. For the window object, determining\\nwhich view is involved is simple--it chooses whichever view object is under the\\ncursor at the time of the mouse button click. This same test isn\\'t made by the window in response to a B_KEY_DOWN message. That\\'s because the location of the\\ncursor when a key is pressed is generally insignificant. The scheme used to determine which view\\'s KeyDown() hook function to invoke involves a focus view.\\nFocus view\\nA program can make any view the focus view by invoking that view\\'s\\nMakeFocus() function. For a view that accepts typed input (such as BTextControl or a BTextView view), the call is made implicitly when the user clicks in\\nthe view to activate the insertion bar. Any view, however, can be made the focus\\nview by explicitly calling MakeFocus(). Here a click of the mouse button while\\nthe cursor is over a view of type MyHelloView makes that view the focus view:\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nMakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nNow, when a key is pressed, the KeyDown() hook function of the last clicked-on\\nview of type MyHelloView will automatically execute.\\n\\nBecause a MyHelloView view doesn\\'t accept keyboard input, there\\nis no obvious reason to make a view of this type the focus view. We\\nhaven\\'t worked with many view types, so the above example must\\nsuffice here. If you\\'re more comfortable having a reason for making\\na MyHelloView accept keyboard input, consider this rather contrived scenario. You want the user to click on a view of type\\nMyHelloView to make it active. Then you want the user to type any\\ncharacter and have the view echo that character back--perhaps in a\\nlarge, bold font. Including the above MouseDown() routine in a\\nproject suffices to make the view the focus view when clicked on.\\nNow a MyHelloView KeyDown() routine can be written to examine\\nthe typed character, clear the view, and draw the typed character.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nKeyDown() example project\\nThe ViewsKeyMessages project adds to the ViewsMouseMessages project to create\\na program that responds to both mouse button clicks and key presses. Once again,\\na mouse button click while the cursor is over a view results in the sounding of the\\nsystem beep. Additionally, ViewsKeyMessages beeps twice if the Return key is\\npressed and three times if the 0 (zero) key is pressed.\\nTo allow a MyHelloView view to respond to a press of a key, the BView hook\\nfunction KeyDown() needs to be overridden:\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\nKeyDown(const char *bytes, int32 numBytes);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe first KeyDown() parameter is an array that encodes the typed character along\\nwith any modifier keys (such as the Shift key) that were down at the time of the\\nkey press. The second parameter tells how many bytes are in the array that is the\\nfirst parameter. As with all hook functions, the values of these parameters are filled\\nin by the system and are available in your implementation of the hook function\\nshould they be of use.\\nThe KeyDown() routine responds to two key presses: the Return key and the 0\\n(zero) key. Pressing the Return key plays the system beep sound twice, while\\npressing the 0 key plays the sound three times:\\nvoid MyHelloView::KeyDown(const char *bytes, int32 numBytes)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000;\\nswitch ( *bytes ) {\\ncase B_RETURN:\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\ndefault:\\nbreak;\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThere are a number of Be-defined constants you can test bytes against; B_RETURN\\nis one of them. The others are: B_BACKSPACE, B_LEFT_ARROW, B_INSERT, B_\\nENTER, B_RIGHT_ARROW, B_DELETE, B_UP_ARROW, B_HOME, B_SPACE, B_DOWN_\\nARROW, B_END, B_TAB, B_PAGE_UP, B_ESCAPE, B_FUNCTION_KEY, and B_PAGE_\\nDOWN. For a key representing an alphanumeric character, just place the character\\nbetween single quotes, as shown above for the 0 (zero) character.\\nNotice that calls to the global function snooze() appear between calls to the global function beep(). The beep() routine executes in its own thread, which means\\nas soon as the function starts, control returns to the caller. If successive, uninterrupted calls are made to beep(), the multiple playing of the system beep will\\nseem like a single sound.\\nOnly the focus view responds to a key press, so the ViewsKeyMessages program\\nneeds to make one of its two views the focus view. I\\'ve elected to do this in the\\nMyHelloView MouseDown() routine. When the user clicks on a view, that view\\nbecomes the focus view:\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nMakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nWhen the user then presses a key, the resulting B_KEY_DOWN message is directed\\nat that view. Since the views are derived from the BView class, rather than a class\\nthat accepts keyboard input, a typed character won\\'t appear in the view. But the\\nview\\'s KeyDown() routine will still be called.\\n\\x0c\\nDrawing\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Colors\\n Patterns\\n The Drawing Pen\\n Shapes\\n\\n5.\\n\\nWhen a Be application draws, it always draws in a view. That\\'s why the chapter\\nthat deals with views precedes this chapter. In Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and\\nMessages, you saw that a BView-derived class overrides its inherited hook member function Draw() so that it can define exactly what view objects should draw\\nin when they get updated. The example projects in this chapter contain classes\\nand member functions that remain unchanged, or changed very little, from previous example projects. What will be different is the content of the Draw() function.\\nThe code that demonstrates the concepts of each drawing topic can usually be\\nadded to the Draw() routine.\\nIn Be programming, the colors and patterns that fill a shape aren\\'t defined explicitly for that shape. Instead, traits of the graphics environment of the view that\\nreceives the drawing are first altered. In other words, many drawing characteristics, such as color and font, are defined at the view level, so all subsequent drawing can use the view settings. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to define a color,\\nthen set a view to draw in that color. You\\'ll see how the same is done for patterns--whether using Be-defined patterns or your own application-defined ones.\\nAfter you learn how to manipulate the graphic characteristics of a view, it\\'s on to\\nthe drawing of specific shapes. The point (represented by BPoint objects) is used\\non its own, to define the end points of a line, and to define the vertices of more\\nsophisticated shapes (such as triangles or polygons). The rectangle (represented by\\nBRect objects) is used on its own and as the basis of more sophisticated shapes.\\nThese shapes include round rectangles, ellipses, and regions. Round rectangles\\nand ellipses are closely related to BRect objects, and aren\\'t defined by their own\\nclasses. Polygons and regions are more sophisticated shapes that make use of\\npoints and rectangles, but are represented by their own class types (BPolygon and\\nBRegion). In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to outline and fill each of these different\\n\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nshapes. Finally, I show how to combine any type and number of these various\\nshapes into a picture represented by a BPicture object.\\n\\nColors\\nThe BeOS is capable of defining colors using any of a number of color spaces. A\\ncolor space is a scheme, or system, for representing colors as numbers. There are\\nseveral color space Be-defined constants, each containing a number that reflects\\nthe number of bits used to represent a single color in a single pixel. For instance,\\nthe B_COLOR_8_BIT color space devotes 8 bits to defining the color of a single\\npixel. The more memory devoted to defining the color of a single pixel, the more\\npossible colors a pixel can display.\\nEach pixel in a drawing is either black (bit is on, or 1) or white (bit is off, or\\n0).\\nEach pixel in a drawing can be one of 256 shades of gray--from black (bit is\\nset to a value of 255) to white (bit is set to a value of 0).\\nEach pixel in a drawing can be one of 256 colors. A pixel value in the range\\nof 0 to 255 is used as an index into a color map. This system color map is\\nidentical for all applications. That means that when two programs use the\\nsame value to color a pixel, the same color will be displayed.\\nEach pixel in a drawing is created from three separate color components: red,\\ngreen, and blue. Five out of a total of sixteen bits are devoted to defining each\\ncolor component. The sixteenth bit is ignored.\\nLike the B_RGB15 color space, each pixel in a drawing is created from three\\nseparate color components: red, green, and blue. In B_RGB32 space, however, eight bits are devoted to defining each color component. The remaining\\neight bits are ignored.\\nLike the B_RGB32 color space, each pixel in a drawing is created from three\\nseparate color components: red, green, and blue. Like B_RGB, eight bits are\\nused to define each of the three color components. In B_RGBA32 space, however, the remaining eight bits aren\\'t ignored--they\\'re devoted to defining an\\nalpha byte, which is used to specify a transparency level for a color.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nRGB Color System\\nAs listed above, the BeOS supports a number of color spaces. The RGB color\\nspace is popular because it provides over sixteen million unique colors (the number of combinations using values in the range of 0 to 255 for each of the three\\ncolor components), and because it is a color system with which many programmers and end users are familiar with (it\\'s common to several operating systems).\\nThe BeOS defines rgb_color as a struct with four fields:\\ntypedef struct {\\n} rgb_color\\n\\nA variable of type rgb_color can be initialized at the time of declaration. The\\norder of the supplied values corresponds to the ordering of the struct definition. The following declares an rgb_color variable named redColor and assigns\\nthe red and alpha fields a value of 255 and the other two fields a value of 0:\\nrgb_color\\n\\n\\nTo add a hint of blue to the color defined by redColor, the third value could be\\nchanged from 0 to, say, 50. Because the alpha component of a color isn\\'t supported at the time of this writing, the last value should be 255. Once supported, an\\nalpha value of 255 will represent a color that is completely opaque; an object of\\nthat color will completely cover anything underneath it. An alpha field value of 0\\nwill result in a color that is completely transparent--an effect you probably don\\'t\\nwant. An rgb_color variable can be set to represent a new color at any time by\\nspecifying new values for some or all of the three color components. Here an\\nrgb_color variable named blueColor is first declared, then assigned values:\\nrgb_color\\n\\nblueColor;\\n\\nblueColor.red\\nblueColor.green\\nblueColor.blue\\nblueColor.alpha\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\n\\nWhile choosing values for the red, green, and blue components of a\\ncolor is easy if you want a primary color, the process isn\\'t completely intuitive for other colors. Quickly now, what values should\\nyou use to generate chartreuse? To experiment with colors and their\\nRGB components, run the ColorControl program that\\'s discussed a\\nlittle later in this chapter. By the way, to create the pale, yellowish\\ngreen color that\\'s chartreuse, try values of about 200, 230, and 100\\nfor the red, green, and blue components, respectively.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nHigh and Low Colors\\nLike all graphics objects, an rgb_color variable doesn\\'t display any color in a\\nwindow on its own--it only sets up a color for later use. A view always keeps\\ntrack of two colors, dubbed the high and low colors. When you draw in the view,\\nyou specify whether the current high color, the current low color, or a mix of the\\ntwo colors should be used.\\nViews and default colors\\nWhen a new view comes into existence, it sets a number of drawing characteristics to default values. Included among these are:\\n\\n\\nA high color of black\\n\\n\\n\\nA low color of white\\n\\n\\n\\nA background color of white\\n\\nAdditionally, when a BView drawing function is invoked, by default it uses the\\nview\\'s high color for the drawing. Together, these facts tell you that unless you\\nexplicitly specify otherwise, drawing will be in black on a white background.\\nSetting the high and low colors\\nThe BView member functions SetHighColor() and SetLowColor() alter the\\ncurrent high and low colors of a view. Pass SetHighColor() an rgb_color and\\nthat color becomes the new high color--and remains as such until the next call to\\nSetHighColor(). The SetLowColor() routine works the same way. This next\\nsnippet sets a view\\'s high color to red and its low color to blue:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\n\\nDrawing with the high and low colors\\nPassing an rgb_color structure to SetHighColor() or SetLowColor() establishes that color as the one to be used by a view when drawing. Now let\\'s see\\nhow the high color is used to draw in color:\\nrgb_color\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nThe previous snippet declares redColor to be a variable of type rgb_color and\\ndefines that variable to represent red. The snippet also declares a BRect variable\\nnamed aRect, and sets that variable to represent a rectangle with a width and\\nheight of 100 pixels. The call to SetHighColor() sets the high color to red.\\nFinally, a call to the BView member function FillRect() fills the rectangle aRect\\nwith the current high color (as specified by the Be-defined constant B_SOLID_\\nHIGH)--the color red.\\nShape-drawing routines such as FillRect() are described in detail later in this\\nchapter. For now, a brief introduction will suffice. A shape is typically drawn by\\nfirst creating a shape object to define the shape, then invoking a BView member\\nfunction to draw it. That\\'s what the previous snippet does: it creates a rectangle\\nshape based on a BRect object, then calls the BView member function\\nFillRect() to draw the rectangle.\\nOne of the parameters to a BView shape-drawing routine is a pattern. As you\\'ll see\\nahead in the \"Patterns\" section of this chapter, a pattern is an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel\\ntemplate that defines some combination of the current high color and low color.\\nThis small template can be repeatedly \"stamped\" into an area of any size to fill that\\narea with the pattern. Patterns are everywhere these days: desktop backgrounds,\\nweb page backgrounds, and so on. You can create your own patterns, or use one\\nof the three Be-defined patterns. Each of the Be-defined patterns is represented by\\na constant:\\n\\n\\nB_SOLID_HIGH is a solid fill of the current high color.\\n\\n\\n\\nB_SOLID_LOW is a solid fill of the current low color.\\n\\n\\n\\nB_MIXED_COLORS is a checkerboard pattern of alternating current high color\\nand low color pixels (providing a dithered effect--what looks like a single\\ncolor blended from the two colors).\\n\\nA view\\'s default high color is black. So before a view calls SetHighColor(), the\\nuse of B_SOLID_HIGH results in a solid black pattern being used. The above snippet invokes SetHighColor() to set the current high color to red, so subsequent\\nuses of B_SOLID_HIGH for this one view result in a solid red pattern being used.\\nDetermining the current high and low colors\\nYou can find out the current high or low color for a view at any time by invoking\\nthe BView member functions HighColor() or LowColor(). Each routine returns\\na value of type rgb_color. This snippet demonstrates the calls:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\ncurrentHighColor;\\ncurrentLowColor;\\n\\ncurrentHighColor = HighColor();\\ncurrentLowColor = LowColor();\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nThe default high color is black, so if you invoke HighColor() before using\\nSetHighColor(), an rgb_color with red, green, and blue field values of 0 will\\nbe returned to the program. The default low color is white, so a call to\\nLowColor() before a call to SetLowColor() will result in the return of an rgb_\\ncolor with red, green, and blue field values of 255. Because the alpha field of\\nthe high and low colors is ignored at the time of this writing, the alpha field will\\nbe 255 in both cases.\\nRGB, low, and high color example project\\nThe RGBColor project is used to build a program that displays a window like the\\none shown in Figure 5-1. Given the nature of this topic, you can well imagine that\\nthe window isn\\'t just as it appears in this figure. Instead a shade of each being a\\nshade of gray, the three rectangles in the window are, from left to right, red, blue,\\nand a red-blue checkerboard. Because of the high resolution typical of today\\'s\\nmonitors, the contents of the rightmost rectangle dither to a solid purple rather\\nthan appearing to the eye as alternating red and blue pixels.\\n\\nFigure 5-1. The window that results from running the RGBColor program\\n\\nChapter 4 included the TwoViewClasses project--a project that introduced a new\\nview class named MyDrawView. That class definition was almost identical to the\\noriginal MyHelloView. This chapter\\'s RGBColor project and all remaining projects\\nin this chapter display a single window that holds a single MyDrawView view, and\\nno MyHelloView. So the MyHelloView.cpp file is omitted from these projects, and\\nthe data member meant to keep track of a MyHelloView in the MyHelloWindow\\nclass (reproduced below) is also omitted:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyDrawView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nCreating a new MyHelloWindow object now entails creating just a single\\nMyDrawView view that fills the window, then attaching the view to the window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyDrawView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyDrawView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nDrawing in a view takes place automatically when the system calls the view\\'s\\nDraw() routine. That function is the code I play with in order to try out drawing\\nideas. Here\\'s how the RGBColor project implements the MyDrawView version of\\nDraw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nrgb_color blueColor;\\nblueColor.red = 0;\\nblueColor.green = 0;\\nblueColor.blue = 255;\\nblueColor.alpha = 255;\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n}\\n\\nThe previous routine demonstrates two methods of assigning an rgb_color variable a color value. After that, the SetHighColor() and SetLowColor() functions set the MyDrawView high color and low color to red and blue, respectively.\\nThen in turn each of the three rectangles is set up, then filled.\\n\\nThe View Color (Background)\\nTo color a shape, the program often refers to the B_SOLID_HIGH constant. As you\\njust saw in the previous example project, the B_SOLID_LOW and B_MIXED_COLORS\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nconstants can also be used to include the view\\'s current low color in the drawing.\\nBy now it should be apparent that neither the high nor low color implicitly has\\nanything to do with a view\\'s background color.\\nSetting a view\\'s background color\\nBy default, a new view has a background color of white. This background color\\ncan be set to any RGB color by invoking the BView member function\\nSetViewColor(). Here a view\\'s background color is being set to purple:\\nSetViewColor(purpleColor);\\n\\nCalling SetViewColor() changes the background color of a view without affecting either the high color or the low color. Consider a view with a current high\\ncolor of blue, a current low color of yellow, and a background color set to purple. Calling a BView fill routine with a pattern argument of B_SOLID_HIGH draws\\na blue shape. An argument of B_SOLID_LOW draws a yellow shape. Finally, an\\nargument of B_MIXED_COLORS draws a green shape. All shapes are drawn against\\nthe view\\'s purple background.\\nView color example project\\nThe ViewColor program displays a window that looks identical to that displayed\\nby the RGBColor example, except for one feature. Both programs display a window with a red, blue, and purple rectangle in it, but the ViewColor window background is pink rather than white. This trick is performed by adding just a few lines\\nof code to the AttachedToWindow() routine defined in the MyDrawView.cpp file\\nin the RGBColor project. Here an rgb_color variable is set up to define the color\\npink, and that variable is used as the argument to a call to SetViewColor().\\nHere\\'s\\nthe\\nnew\\nversion\\nof\\nthe\\nMyDrawView member\\nfunction\\nAttachedToWindow():\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nSetViewColor(pinkColor);\\n}\\n\\nColor Control View\\nThe RGB components of any given color won\\'t be known by a program\\'s user.\\nThere are exceptions, of course--graphics artists involved in electronic media or\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nelectronic publications may have a working knowledge of how RGB values correspond to colors. Those exceptions aside, if your program allows users to select\\ntheir own colors, your program should provide a very user-friendly means for\\nthem to accomplish this task. The BColorControl class does just that.\\nColor levels and the BColorControl object\\nThe BColorControl class is derived from the BControl class, which itself is\\nderived from the BView class. So a BColorControl object is a type of view. Your\\nprogram creates a BColorControl object in order to allow a user to select an\\nRGB color without the user knowing anything about the RGB color system or RGB\\nvalues.\\nWhat the BColorControl object displays to the user depends on the number of\\ncolors the user\\'s monitor is currently displaying. The user can set that parameter\\nby choosing Screen from the preferences menu in the Deskbar. Coincidentally, the\\nScreen preferences window (which has been revamped and turned into the Background preferences application) itself holds a BColorControl object. So you can\\nsee how the monitor\\'s color depth is set and take a look at a BColorControl\\nobject by selecting the Screen preferences or by simply looking at Figure 5-2.\\n\\nFigure 5-2. The Screen preferences program set to display 8-bit color\\n\\nThe Screen preferences window holds a number of objects representing BViewderived classes. Among them is a pop-up menu titled Colors. In Figure 5-2, you\\nsee that I have my monitor set to devote 8 bits of graphics memory to each pixel,\\nso my monitor can display up to 256 colors. The Screen preferences window lets\\nme choose one of the 256 system colors to be used as my desktop color. This is\\ndone by clicking on one of the 256 small colored squares. This matrix, or block of\\nsquares, is a BColorControl object.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nChoosing 32-Bits/Pixel from the Colors pop-up menu in the Screen preferences\\nwindow sets a monitor to display any of millions of colors. As shown in\\nFigure 5-3, doing so also changes the look of the BColorControl object. Now a\\ncolor is selected by clicking on the red, green, and blue ramps, or bands, of color\\nalong the bottom of the Screen preferences window. Unbeknownst to the user,\\ndoing this sets up an RGB color. The Screen preferences program combines the\\nuser\\'s three color choices and uses the resulting RGB value as the desktop color.\\n\\nFigure 5-3. The Screen preferences program set to display 32-bit color\\n\\nCreating a BColorControl object\\nThe Screen preferences window serves as a good example of how a\\nBColorControl object can help the user. To use the class in your own program,\\ndeclare a BColorControl object and the variables that will be used as parameters to the BColorControl constructor. Then create the new object using new and\\nthe BColorControl constructor:\\nBColorControl\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\n*aColorControl;\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_16x16;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\naColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(aColorControl);\\n\\nThe first BColorControl constructor parameter, leftTop, indicates where the top\\nleft corner of the color control should appear. The color control will be placed in\\na view (by calling the AddChild() function of the host view, as shown above), so\\nyou should set BPoint\\'s coordinates relative to the view\\'s borders.\\nThe second parameter, matrix, is of the Be-defined datatype color_control_\\nlayout. When the user has the monitor set to 8 bits per pixel, the 256 system colors are displayed in a matrix. This parameter specifies how these squares should\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nbe arranged. Use one of five Be-defined constants here: B_CELLS_4x64, B_\\nCELLS_8x32, B_CELLS_16x16, B_CELLS_32x8, or B_CELLS_64x4. The two numbers in each constant name represent the number of columns and rows, respectively, that the colored squares are placed in. For example, B_CELLS_32x8 displays the 256 colors in eight rows with 32 colored squares in each row.\\nThe third BColorControl constructor parameter, cellSide, determines the pixel\\nsize of each colored square in the matrix. A value of 10, for instance, results in 256\\nsquares that are each 10 pixels by 10 pixels in size.\\nThe fourth parameter provides a name for the BColorControl object. Like any\\nview, a BColorControl object has a name that can be used to find the view. The\\nname can be supplied using a string (as shown in the previous snippet) or by\\npassing in a constant variable that was defined as a const char * (as in const\\nchar *name = \"ColorControl\";).\\nNote that the overall size of the BColorControl object isn\\'t directly specified in\\nthe constructor. The size is calculated by the constructor, and depends on the values supplied in the second and third parameters. The matrix parameter specifies\\nthe shape of the block of colors, while the cellSide value indirectly determines\\nthe overall size. A matrix with 8 rows of cells that are each 10 pixels high will\\nhave a height of 80 pixels, for instance.\\nI\\'ve discussed the BColorControl constructor parameters as if they will be used\\nwith 8-bit pixels. For the values used in the previous example, the resulting color\\ncontrol looks like the one displayed in the window in Figure 5-4. If the user\\ninstead has the monitor set to 32 bits for each pixel, the same arguments are used\\nin the display of four bands, three of which the user clicks on in order to create a\\nsingle color. The top gray band represents the alpha, or color transparency level,\\ncomponent. As of this writing, the alpha component is unimplemented, but it\\nshould be implemented by the time you read this. Instead of creating a matrix of\\ncolor squares, the arguments are now used to determine the shape and overall\\nsize the four bands occupy. Figure 5-5 shows the color control that results from\\nexecuting the previous snippet when the monitor is set to 32 bits per pixel.\\n\\nThe user can set the monitor to the desired bits-per-pixel level, so\\nyour program can\\'t count on being used for a matrix or bands. In\\nFigure 5-5, you see that the color bands are very broad--that\\'s the\\nresult of specifying a 16-by-16 matrix (B_CELLS_16x16). To display\\nlonger, narrower color bands, choose a different Be-defined constant for the BColorControl constructor matrix argument (such as\\nB_CELLS_64x4). Regardless of the values you choose for the\\nmatrix and cellSize parameters, test the resulting color control\\nunder both monitor settings to verify that the displayed control fits\\nwell in the window that displays it.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nUsing a color control\\nWhen a window displays a color control, the user selects a color by clicking on its\\ncell (if the user\\'s monitor is set to 8 bits per pixel) or by clicking on a color intensity in each of the three color component bands (if the user\\'s monitor is set to 32\\nbits per pixel). In either case, the BColorControl object always keeps track of\\nthe currently selected color. Your program can obtain this color at any time via a\\ncall to the BColorControl member function ValueAsColor(). Obviously\\nenough, a call to this routine returns the value of the color control object in the\\nform of an RGB color. In this next snippet, the user\\'s current color choice is\\nreturned and stored in an rgb_color variable named userColorChoice:\\nrgb_color\\n\\nuserColorChoice;\\n\\nuserColorChoice = aColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\n\\nWhat your program does with the returned color is application-specific. Just bear\\nin mind that this value can be used the same way any rgb_color is used. You\\nknow about the SetHighColor() routine that sets a view\\'s high color, and you\\'ve\\nseen how to fill a rectangle with the current high color by calling the BView member function FillRect(), so an example that carries on with the previous snippet\\'s userColorChoice RGB color will be easily understandable:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\nThe previous snippet creates a rectangle in the shape of a long horizontal bar, sets\\nthe high color to whatever color the user has the color control currently set at,\\nthen fills the rectangle with that color.\\nColorControl example project\\nIf you set your monitor to use 8 bits per pixel (using the Screen preferences utility), running this chapter\\'s ColorControl example program results in a window like\\nthe one shown in Figure 5-4. If you instead have your monitor set to use 32 bits\\nper pixel, running the same program displays a window like that shown in\\nFigure 5-5.\\nRegardless of your monitor\\'s pixel setting, the ColorControl program displays three\\ntext boxes to the right of the color matrix or color bands. These text boxes are displayed automatically by the BColorControl object, and the area they occupy\\nconstitutes a part of the total area occupied by the control. If you click on a color\\ncell or a color band, the numbers in these boxes will change to reflect the appropriate RGB values for the color you\\'ve selected. If you click in a text box (or use\\nthe Tab key to move to a text box) and type in a value between 0 and 255, the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-4. The ColorControl program\\'s window that results from running at 8-bit color\\n\\nFigure 5-5. The ColorControl program\\'s window that results from running at 32-bit color\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\ncolor display will update itself to display the color that best matches the value\\nyou\\'ve entered. These actions are all automatic, and require no coding effort on\\nyour part. The reason this handy feature works is that the BControl class overrides the BView class member function KeyDown(), and in turn the\\nBColorControl class overrides the BControl version of KeyDown(). The\\nBColorControl version of the routine sees to it that the text box values reflect\\nthe displayed color.\\nIf you move the cursor out of the color control area (keep in mind that this area\\nincludes the text boxes), then click the mouse button, a long, narrow bar is drawn\\nalong the bottom of the window--as shown in Figures 5-4 and 5-5. The color of\\nthis bar will match whatever color you have currently selected in the color control. The selection of this color and the drawing of the bar are handled by the\\nMyDrawView version of the MouseDown() routine. Besides overriding the Bview\\nhook function MouseDown(), this project\\'s version of the MyDrawView class adds a\\nBColorControl data member. The color control data member will be used to\\nkeep track of the control. Here\\'s how the ColorControl project declares the\\nMyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nprivate:\\nBColorControl\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n*fColorControl;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloApplication class and MyHelloWindow class are almost identical to\\nversions found in previous examples. The MyHelloApplication constructor\\ndefines the size of a window and creates a single MyHelloWindow, and the\\nMyHelloWindow defines a single MyDrawView whose size is the same as the window it resides in.\\nThe MyDrawView constructor, which in other projects has been empty, sets up and\\ncreates a color control. The control object is added to the newly created\\nMyDrawView object as a child:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout matrix = B_CELLS_16x16;\\nlong\\ncellSide = 16;\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n}\\n\\nIn the MyDrawView constructor, you see that the control will have its top left corner start 20 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the top of the MyDrawView\\nview that the control appears in. Starting down 50 pixels from the top of the view\\nleaves room for the two lines of instructional text that are displayed in the window (refer back to Figure 5-4 or 5-5). Those lines are drawn each time the system\\nhas to update the view they appear in:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\n}\\n\\nWhen the user clicks in the MyDrawView view, the MouseDown() routine that the\\nMyDrawView class overrides is automatically invoked:\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nBRect\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\n\\nMouseDown() creates the long, thin rectangle that appears along the bottom of the\\nview when the user clicks the mouse button. Before this function draws the rectangle with a call to FillRect(), a ValueAsColor() call obtains the color currently selected in the view\\'s color control. A call to SetHighColor() makes the\\nuser-selected color the one used in function calls that include B_SOLID_HIGH as a\\nparameter.\\nImproving the ColorControl example project\\nFor brevity, the ColorControl example sets the high color and fills in the colored\\nrectangle in the MouseDown() routine. Typically, drawing takes place only in a\\nview\\'s Draw() function. One way to accomplish that would be to move the code\\ncurrently in MouseDown() to Draw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\nrgb_color\\n\\nuserColorChoice;\\n\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\n\\nThe body of MouseDown() could then consist of a single line of code: a call to the\\nBView function Invalidate(). Then, when the user clicks the mouse in the\\nMyDrawView view, MouseDown() makes the system aware of the fact that the view\\nneeds updating, and the system invokes Draw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nInvalidate();\\n}\\n\\nOne further improvement to the ColorControl example program would be to preserve the current state of the view before changing its high color. As implemented\\n(here and in the previous section), the text the program draws is drawn in black\\nthe first time the Draw() function executes. Subsequent calls will update any previously obscured text (as in the case when an overlapping window is moved off\\nthe ColorControl program\\'s window) in whatever color was selected by the user.\\nThat is, the program\\'s call to SetHighColor() affects not only the long, narrow\\ncolor rectangle at the bottom of the program\\'s window, but also text drawn with\\ncalls to DrawString(). To remedy this, preserve the state of the high color by\\ninvoking the BView function HighColor() to get the current high color before\\nchanging it. After calling SetHighColor() and FillRect(), use the rgb_color\\nvalue returned by HighColor() to reset the high color to its state prior to the use\\nof the user-selected color. Here\\'s how Draw() now looks:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nrgb_color origHighColor;\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\norigHighColor = HighColor();\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nSetHighColor(origHighColor);\\n}\\n\\nPatterns\\nA pattern is an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel area. Each of the 64 pixels in this area has the\\ncolor of either the current high or current low color. A pattern can be one solid\\ncolor (by designating that all pixels in the pattern be only the current high color or\\nonly the current low color), or it can be any arrangement of the two colors, as in a\\ncheckerboard, stripes, and so forth. Regardless of the arrangement of the pixels\\nthat make up the pattern, it can be used to fill an area of any size. And regardless\\nof the size or shape of an area, once a pattern is defined it can be easily \"poured\"\\ninto this area to give the entire area the look of the pattern.\\n\\nBe-Defined Patterns\\nYou\\'ve already encountered three patterns--the Be-defined constants B_SOLID_\\nHIGH, B_SOLID_LOW, B_MIXED_COLORS each specify a specific arrangement of colors in an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel area. Here the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern is used to fill\\na rectangle with a checkerboard pattern made up of alternating current high and\\ncurrent low colors:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(aRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n\\nThe BView class defines a number of stroke and fill member functions. Each\\nstroke function (such as StrokeRect() and StrokePolygon()) outlines a shape\\nusing a specified pattern. Patterns have the greatest effect on the look of a shape\\noutline when the outline has a thickness greater than one pixel (setting the thickness at which lines are drawn is covered ahead in the \"The Drawing Pen\" section). Each fill function (such as FillRect() and FillPolygon()) fills a shape\\nusing a specified pattern. This may not be entirely obvious when looking at some\\nsource code snippets because these drawing routines make the pattern parameter\\noptional. When the pattern parameter is skipped, the function uses the B_SOLID_\\nHIGH pattern by default. So both of the following calls to FillRect() produce a\\nrectangle filled with a solid pattern in the current high color:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\\x0cPatterns\\n\\n\\nEarlier in this chapter, the example project RGBColor demonstrated the use of the\\nB_SOLID_HIGH, B_SOLID_LOW, and B_MIXED_COLORS constants by using these\\nconstants in the filling of three rectangles (see Figure 5-1). After setting the high\\ncolor to red and the low color to blue, the rectangle that was filled using the\\nB_MIXED_COLORS constant appeared to be purple. I say \"appeared to be purple\"\\nbecause, in fact, none of the pixels in the rectangle are purple. Instead, each is\\neither red or blue. Because the pixels alternate between these two colors, and\\nbecause pixel density is high on a typical monitor, the resulting rectangle appears\\nto the eye to be solid purple. Figure 5-6 illustrates this by showing the RGBColor\\nprogram\\'s window and the window of the pixel-viewing utility program Magnify.\\nThe Magnify program (which is a Be-supplied application that was placed on your\\nmachine during installation of the BeOS) shows an enlarged view of the pixels\\nsurrounding the cursor. In Figure 5-6, the cursor is over a part of the purple rectangle in the RGBColor window, and the pixels are displayed in the Magnify window.\\n\\nFigure 5-6. Using the Magnify program to view the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern\\n\\nApplication-Defined Patterns\\nThe three Be-defined patterns come in handy, but they don\\'t exploit the real\\npower of patterns. Your project can define a pattern that carries out precisely your\\nidea of what a shape should be filled with.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBit definition of a pattern\\nA pattern designates which of the 64 bits (8 rows of 8 bits) in an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel\\narea display the current high color and which display the current low color. Thus\\nthe specific colors displayed by the pattern aren\\'t designated by the pattern.\\nInstead, a pattern definition marks each of its 64 bits as either a 1 to display the\\nhigh color or a 0 to display the low color. The colors themselves come from the\\nhigh and low colors at the time the pattern is used in drawing.\\nA pattern is specified by listing the hexadecimal values of the eight bits that make\\nup each row of the pattern. Consider the pattern shown in Figure 5-7. Here I show\\nthe 8-by-8 grid for a pattern that produces a diagonal stripe. You can do the same\\nusing a pencil and graph paper. Each cell represents one pixel, with a filled-in cell\\nconsidered on, or 1, and an untouched cell considered off, or 0. Since a pattern\\ndefines only on and off, not color, this technique works fine regardless of the colors to be used when drawing with the pattern.\\n\\nFigure 5-7. The binary and hexadecimal representations of a pattern\\n\\nThe left side of Figure 5-7 shows the binary representation of each row in the pattern, with a row chunked into groups of four bits. The right side of the figure\\nshows the corresponding hexadecimal values for each row. Looking at the top\\nrow, from left to right, the pixels are on/on/off/off, or binary 1100. The second set\\nof four pixels in the top row has the same value. A binary value of 1100 is hexadecimal c, so the binary pair translates to the hexadecimal pair cc. The hexadecimal values for each remaining row are determined in the same manner. If you\\'re\\nproficient at working with hexadecimal values, you can skip the intermediate\\nbinary step and write the hexadecimal value for each row by simply looking at the\\npixels in groups of four.\\nRow by row, the hexadecimal values for the pattern in Figure 5-7 are: cc, 66, 33,\\n99, cc, 66, 33, 99. Using the convention of preceding a hexadecimal value with 0x,\\nthe pattern specification becomes: 0xcc, 0x66, 0x33, 0x99, 0xcc, 0x66, 0x33, 0x99.\\n\\x0cPatterns\\n\\n\\nThe pattern datatype\\nUsing the previous method to define a pattern isn\\'t just an exercise in your knowledge of hexadecimal numbers, of course! Instead, you\\'ll use a pattern\\'s eight hexadecimal pairs in assigning a pattern variable. Here\\'s how Be defines the\\npattern datatype:\\ntypedef struct {\\n} pattern;\\n\\nEach of the eight elements in the pattern array is one byte in size, so each can\\nhold a single unsigned value in the range of 0 to 255. Each of the hexadecimal\\npairs in each of the eight rows in a pattern falls into this range (0x00 = 0, 0xff =\\n255). To create a pattern variable, determine the hexadecimal pairs for the pattern (as shown above) and assign the variable those values. Here I\\'m doing that\\nfor the pattern I designed back in Figure 5-7:\\npattern\\n\\n\\nThis is also how Be defines its three built-in patterns. The B_SOLID_HIGH pattern\\nis one that has all its bits set to 1, or on; the B_SOLID_LOW pattern has all its bits\\nset to 0, or off; and the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern has its bits set to alternate\\nconst pattern B_SOLID_HIGH\\nconst pattern B_SOLID_LOW\\n\\nUsing a pattern variable\\nOnce initialized, a variable of type pattern is used just as one of the Be-defined\\npattern constants--pass the variable as an argument to any routine that requires a\\npattern as a parameter. The following snippet defines a pattern variable and two\\nrectangle variables. The code then fills one rectangle with a solid color and the\\nother with diagonal stripes:\\npattern\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(solidRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nFillRect(stripedRect, stripePattern);\\n\\nBecause the previous snippet doesn\\'t include any code that hints at the current\\nstate of the high and low colors, you can\\'t infer what colors will be in the resulting rectangles--you know only that one will have a solid fill while the other will\\nhave diagonal stripes running through it.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nPattern example project\\nThe Pattern project builds a program that displays a window with a single rectangle drawn in it. The rectangle is filled with the diagonal stripe pattern that was\\nintroduced on the preceding pages. Figure 5-8 shows the Pattern program\\'s window. Also shown is the Magnify program\\'s window as it displays an enlarged view\\nof some of the pixels in the Pattern program\\'s filled rectangle.\\n\\nFigure 5-8. Using the Magnify program to view the application-defined pattern\\n\\nAs is the case for many of this chapter\\'s remaining examples, the Pattern project\\nwas created by starting with a recent project (such as the RGBColor project) and\\naltering the code in just one of the routines--the Draw() member function of the\\nMyDrawView class. Here\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nFillRect(aRect, stripePattern);\\n}\\n\\nYou can experiment with the Pattern project by adding color to the rectangle. Precede the call to FillRect() with a call to SetHighColor(), SetLowColor(), or\\nboth. Changing the current high color will change the color of what are presently\\n\\x0cThe Drawing Pen\\n\\n\\nthe black stripes, while changing the current low color will change the color of\\nwhat are presently the white stripes.\\n\\nThe Drawing Pen\\nWhenever drawing takes place, the pen is at work. The pen is a way to summarize and express two properties of a view\\'s drawing environment. When drawing\\nstarts, it starts at some specific location in a view. When line drawing takes place,\\nthe line has some specific thickness to it. These traits are stored in a view and can\\nbe altered by invoking BView member functions. In keeping with the analogy of\\ndrawing with a pen, the names of these routines include the word \"pen.\"\\n\\nPen Location\\nThe location of the rectangle drawn by Fillrect() has been previously established during the setting up of the rectangle:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\nFor the drawing of text and lines, this isn\\'t the case. Typically, you\\'ll move the pen\\nto the location where drawing is to start, then draw.\\nMoving the pen\\nWhen it\\'s said that the pen is moved, what\\'s actually taking place is that a call sets\\nthe starting location for subsequent drawing. Moving the pen doesn\\'t have any visible effect--nothing gets drawn. To move the pen, invoke the view\\'s\\nMovePenTo() or MovePenBy() function.\\nThe MovePenTo() function accepts either a single BPoint argument or a pair of\\nfloating-point arguments. In either case, the result is that the arguments specify the\\ncoordinate at which the next act of drawing starts. The first argument to\\nMovePenTo() is the horizontal coordinate to move to, while the second argument\\nis the vertical coordinate. The movement is relative to the view\\'s origin. Each of\\nthe following four calls to MovePenTo() has the same result--drawing will be set\\nto start at pixel (30.0, 40.0) in the view\\'s system coordinate:\\nBPoint\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nx = 30.0;\\ny = 40.0;\\n\\nMovePenTo(aPoint);\\nMovePenTo(x, y);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nLike MovePenTo(), the MovePenBy() function moves the starting location for\\ndrawing. MovePenTo() moves the pen relative to the view\\'s origin. MovePenBy()\\nmoves the pen relative to its current location in the view. Consider this snippet:\\n\\nThe call to MovePenTo() moves the pen to the location 30 pixels from the left of\\nthe view and 40 pixels from the top of the view. That places the pen at the point\\n(30.0, 40.0). The call to MovePenBy() uses this current location as the reference\\nand moves the pen 70 pixels to the left and 10 pixels down. The result is that, relative to the view\\'s origin, the pen is at the point (100.0, 50.0).\\nNegative values for MovePenBy() move the pen \"backwards\" in the view. A negative horizontal argument moves the pen to the left, while a negative vertical argument moves the pen up. Because MovePenTo() specifies a particular coordinate\\nto end up at rather than a direction to move in, negative values shouldn\\'t be\\npassed as the arguments of this routine.\\nMovePen example project\\nAs shown in Figure 5-9, the MovePen project results in a program that displays a\\nwindow with three characters written to it. I\\'ve added coordinate information to\\nthe figure--the arrows and values aren\\'t actually displayed in the window.\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\nC\\n\\nFigure 5-9. The window that results from running the MovePen program\\n\\nWhere the characters \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" get drawn in the window depends on calls\\nto the MovePenTo() and MovePenBy() functions. To get a good feel for working\\nwith a view\\'s coordinate system, edit the arguments to the existing function calls in\\nthe Draw() routine, or add additional calls to MovePenTo() and MovePenBy():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cThe Drawing Pen\\n\\n\\nDrawString(\"A\");\\nDrawString(\"B\");\\nDrawString(\"C\");\\n}\\n\\nPen Size\\nThe pen is used to draw shape outlines. Chapter 4 introduced the BView member\\nfunction StrokeRect(), which draws the outline of a rectangle. Here a 100-pixelby-100-pixel rectangle is framed in a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see later in this chapter, there are a number of BView StrokeXxx()\\nmember functions, each of which outlines a particular shape. All of these functions are affected by the current size of the pen.\\nSetting the pen size\\nBy default, the pen can be thought of as having a tip that is the size of a single\\npixel. Thus, drawing with the pen produces a line with a thickness of one pixel.\\nYou can change the size or thickness of the pen at any time by invoking the\\nBView member function SetPenSize(). This routine accepts a single argument,\\nthe new pixel thickness for the pen. In this next snippet, the same rectangle that\\nwas outlined in the previous snippet is given a frame, or border, three pixels thick.\\nThe lines you specify to be drawn are in the center of the pixels in a thick pen.\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nSetting the pen size for a view affects all subsequent calls to StrokeXxx() functions. After changing the pen size and invoking a StrokeXxx() function, you may\\nwant to reset the pen size to a thickness of a single pixel:\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nGetting the pen size\\nThe best process to use when altering the pen size is to obtain and save the current pen size, change it, perform the desired drawing using the new pen size, then\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nrestore the pen to the saved size. The BView member function PenSize() allows\\nyou to do that. When invoked, PenSize() returns a float that holds the current\\nthickness of the pen. This next snippet provides an example of the use of\\nPenSize():\\nfloat\\n\\nsavedPenSize;\\n\\nsavedPenSize = PenSize();\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\nSetPenSize(savedPenSize);\\n\\nPenSize example project\\nThe PenSize project displays a window that holds six rectangles. As shown in\\nFigure 5-10, the thickness of the outline of each rectangle differs.\\n\\nFigure 5-10. The window that results from running the PenSize program\\n\\nAs is becoming a habit, the Draw() function of the MyDrawView class does the\\nexample\\'s work. The function begins by defining and setting six rectangles. Each\\nrectangle has a width of 40 pixels and a height of 80 pixels. The outline thickness\\nof each rectangle differs due to the call to SetPenSize() that precedes each call\\nto StrokeRect():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\n\\nShapes\\nBe claims that the BeOS is an operating system for the graphics community. So it\\'s\\nhoped that the BeOS makes it easy for programmers to support the drawing of\\nboth simple and complex shapes. And, of course, it does.\\n\\nPoints and Lines\\nDrawing a line or lines is drawing at its most basic level. Points are used in specifying where a line should be drawn within a view.\\nThe BPoint class\\nA point is represented by a BPoint object. The BPoint object consists of two\\nfloating point values, one denoting an x or horizontal coordinate and the other\\ndefining a y or vertical coordinate. On a monitor, this coordinate pair matches one\\nparticular pixel.\\nA BPoint object can have values assigned to its coordinate pair members either at\\nthe time of declaration or anytime thereafter. At declaration, one of the BPoint\\nconstructors can be used to take care of the task of assigning values to the BPoint\\nmembers:\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\nTo assign coordinates after the object\\'s declaration, either use the BPoint member function Set() or assign values directly to the x and y data members:\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nNote the lack of the use of new in the previous line of code, and the direct assignment of values to an object\\'s data members. The point is basic to drawing operations, so Be has defined the BPoint to act like a basic datatype rather than a class.\\nThe declaration of a BPoint is all that\\'s needed to actually create a BPoint object.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBecause the BPoint data members are declared public, direct access is allowed.\\nYou\\'ve seen a similar situation with the BRect class as well.\\nLine drawing\\nUnlike BPoint, the BeOS defines no BLine class to represent lines. Instead, line\\ndrawing takes place using the BView member function StrokeLine(). When\\ninvoking this function, you can use a pair of BPoint objects to specify the start\\nand end points of a line, or a single BPoint object to specify just the line\\'s end\\npoint. If only the end point is specified, the current pen location in the view is\\nused as the start point. Both types of call to StrokeLine() are demonstrated\\nhere:\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the previous snippet, two lines are drawn. The first is a horizontal line 100 pixels in length that is drawn from the point (50.0, 50.0) to the point (150.0, 50). The\\nsecond is a vertical line 50 pixels in length that is drawn from the point (20.0, 200.\\n0) to the point (20.0, 250.0).\\nBoth versions of StrokeLine() offer a final optional parameter that specifies a\\npattern in which the line is drawn. The following snippet draws lines of the same\\nlength and location as the previous snippet (assume the same BPoint variables\\nare declared). Here, however, the horizontal line is red and the vertical line is\\ngreen:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\nredColor\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(greenColor);\\n\\nYou aren\\'t limited to the Be-defined patterns--any pattern can be used as an argument to StrokeLine(). In this next snippet, the diagonal stripe pattern discussed\\nearlier in this chapter is used. The high color is set to red, and the low color is left\\nin its default state of white. Additionally, the pen size is set to 10.0. The result is a\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nline 10 pixels in thickness with diagonal red stripes running through it.

After drawing\\nthe line, the pen is first moved to the line\\'s start point, and then moved down a\\nnumber of pixels. StrokeLine() is called again, this time to draw a diagonal line\\nthat ends at the same point where the first line ended.\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-12.

But they are also instrumental in\\nthe definition of other shapes, including round rectangles, ellipses, and regions--\\nas you\\'ll see ahead.\\nSetting a rectangle\\nA BRect object has four data members of type float: left, top, right, and\\nbottom. Each data member specifies a pixel location that defines one of the four\\nedges of a rectangle. The values of the left and right members are relative to\\nthe left edge of the view that is to hold the rectangle, while the values of the top\\nand bottom members are relative to the top edge of the view.\\nUpon declaration, the boundaries of a BRect object can be set by specifying values for each of the four data members or by listing two points--one of which\\nspecifies the rectangle\\'s top left corner while the other specifies the rectangle\\'s\\nbottom right corner. In this next snippet, both of the BRect objects would have\\nthe same boundaries:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\x0cShapes\\nBPoint\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nA rectangle\\'s data members can also be set after the BRect object\\'s declaration.\\nAgain, the following rectangle shares the same coordinates as the previous two:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\naRect.left\\naRect.top\\naRect.right\\naRect.bottom\\n\\n\\nA more efficient means of achieving the above result is to use the BRect member\\nfunction Set(). The order of the values passed to Set() is left, top, right,\\nbottom:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nLike a point, which is represented by a BPoint object, a rectangle is considered\\nbasic to drawing. The BRect class is set up so that a BRect object is created upon\\ndeclaration of a BRect. Additionally, the BRect data members are public, so they\\ncan be accessed either directly or via member functions such as Set(). In short,\\nBRect objects and BPoint objects can and should be created on the stack\\n(declared locally).\\nDrawing a rectangle\\nIn Chapter 4, you saw that shape drawing is achieved by invoking a BView member function. There, StrokeRect() was called to draw a framing rectangle around\\na view. In this chapter, you\\'ve already seen that a rectangle is filled by calling\\nFillRect(). Both routines accept as an argument a previously set up rectangle.\\nThis snippet calls StrokeRect() to frame one rectangle, then calls FillRect()\\nto fill a smaller rectangle centered within the first:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(outerRect);\\nFillRect(innerRect);\\n\\nBoth StrokeRect() and FillRect() accept an optional pattern parameter.\\nHere the rectangles just defined are drawn with a black and white checkerboard\\npattern:\\nStrokeRect(outerRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\nFillRect(innerRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nRectangles example project\\nThe Rectangles project displays a window consisting of the rectangles shown in\\nFigure 5-13.\\n\\nFigure 5-13. The window that results from running the Rectangles program\\n\\nThe left rectangle consists of many nested, or inset, rectangles. The MyDrawView\\nmember function Draw() sets up what will be the outermost rectangle shown.\\nAfter the BRect object\\'s boundaries are set, a for loop insets and draws each rectangle. The BRect member function InsetBy() creates the desired inset effect by\\nadjusting the values of the data members of the calling BRect object. After fifteen\\nrectangles are framed one inside the other, a solid black rectangle is drawn to the\\nright of the window:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i = 0; i < 15; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nFillRect(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nRound rectangles\\nA rectangle with rounded corners is a shape that appears in both user-interface\\nelements (most buttons are round rectangles) and everyday objects (picture some\\nof the boxes in a flow chart). You can use the BView member function\\nStrokeRoundRect() to take an \"ordinary\" rectangle--a BRect object--and provide a degree of rounding to each of its corners.\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nIn StrokeRoundRect(), the first argument is a previously set up rectangle. The\\nsecond and third StrokeRoundRect() parameters specify the amount of rounding to be applied to each corner. Together these two parameters specify the shape\\nof an ellipse; the second parameter establishes the ellipse radius along the x-axis,\\nwhile the third parameter establishes the ellipse radius along the y-axis. Think of\\nsetting an ellipse in each corner of the rectangle and drawing only one quarter of\\nthe ellipse in order to form a rounded corner. The following snippet demonstrates\\na call to StrokeRoundRect():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nTo fill a round rectangle, call the BView member function FillRoundRect(). The\\nparameters to this function match those used in StrokeRoundRect():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nLike other BView drawing routines, both StrokeRoundRect() and\\nFillRoundRect() accept an optional pattern argument. Omitting this argument\\ntells the view to use B_SOLID_HIGH.\\n\\nEllipses\\nYou\\'ve seen that a line isn\\'t represented by a class, but is instead drawn using a\\nBView member function. A similar situation exists for an ellipse. And like a round\\nrectangle, an ellipse is specified using a rectangle.\\nDrawing an ellipse\\nAfter defining a rectangle, an ellipse is drawn by inscribing an oval within the\\nboundaries of the rectangle. The rectangle itself isn\\'t drawn--it simply serves to\\nspecify the size of the ellipse. A circle, of course, is an ellipse whose height and\\nwidth are equal.\\nThe BView member function StrokeEllipse() does the drawing:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nStrokeEllipse(aRect);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nAn ellipse can be filled by the BView member function FillEllipse():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nFillEllipse(aRect);\\n\\nBy default, an ellipse is outlined or filled using a solid pattern and the current high\\ncolor. As with other BView drawing routines, a call to either StrokeEllipse() or\\nFillEllipse() can include an optional second parameter that specifies a different pattern.\\nAn alternate method of specifying the boundaries of an ellipse is to supply\\nStrokeEllipse() or FillEllipse() with a center point and an x-axis and\\ny-axis radius. The next snippet draws a single ellipse that is both outlined and\\nfilled. A call to SetLowColor() sets the low color to blue. The subsequent call to\\nFillEllipse() draws an ellipse that is filled with a black and blue checkerboard pattern. Specifying the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern in the call to\\nFillEllipse() tells the routine to fill the ellipse with a checkerboard pattern that\\nalternates the current high color (by default, black) with the current low color\\n(which was just set to blue). The call to StrokeEllipse() relies on the current\\nhigh color (black) to outline the ellipse in a solid pattern (B_SOLID_HIGH, since\\nno pattern was specified). Note that when both filling and outlining a single ellipse\\nit\\'s important to call the StrokeEllipse() routine after calling FillEllipse().\\nIf the calling order is reversed, the call to FillEllipse() will obscure whatever\\noutline was drawn by the call to StrokeEllipse():\\nrgb_color\\nBPoint\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nxRadius = 40.0;\\nyRadius = 60.0;\\n\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\nFillEllipse(center, xRadius, yRadius, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\nStrokeEllipse(center, xRadius, yRadius);\\n\\nPolygons\\nA polygon is a closed shape with straight sides. Unlike a rectangle, which consists\\nof sides that must be vertical and horizontal, a polygon can include sides that run\\ndiagonally.\\nSetting up a polygon\\nThe BPolygon class is used to create objects that represent polygons. When creating a new BPolygon object, pass the BPolygon constructor an array of BPoints\\nthat specify the points that make up the vertices of the polygon, along with an\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nint32 value that specifies how many points are in the array. Here\\'s how a\\nBPolygon object representing a three-sided polygon might be defined:\\nBPoint\\nBPolygon\\n\\nnumPoints = 3;\\n*aPolygon;\\n\\naPolygon = new BPolygon(pointArray, numPoints);\\n\\nThe previous snippet creates an array of three BPoint objects. The coordinates of\\neach BPoint object are then assigned by calling the BPoint member function\\nSet(). Next, new is used to create a new BPolygon object whose vertices are\\ndefined by the BPoints in the pointArray array.\\nAlternatively, a BPolygon can be created without immediately defining its vertices. In this case, the polygon can be defined later by calling the BPolygon member function AddPoints(), which adds an array of BPoint objects to the\\nBPolygon object. Here, the same polygon that was defined in the previous snippet is again defined--this time using a call to AddPoints():\\nBPoint\\nBPolygon\\n\\nnumPoints = 3;\\n*aPolygon;\\n\\naPolygon = new BPolygon();\\naPolygon->AddPoints(pointArray, numPoints);\\n\\nDrawing a polygon\\nOnce a BPolygon object is defined, its outline can be drawn by calling the BView\\nmember function StrokePolygon(), or it can be filled in with the BView member function FillPolygon(). If the following call to StrokePolygon() is made\\nafter either of the previous two snippets execute, the result is an outlined triangle.\\nStrokePolygon(aPolygon);\\n\\nNote that StrokePolygon() draws the lines of the polygon\\'s edges starting at the\\nfirst point in the array, and finishes by closing the polygon with a line from the\\nlast point back to the first point. Thus, the previous call to StrokePolygon()\\ndraws the following three lines.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA call to FillPolygon() fills the previously defined polygon with a pattern. Here\\nthe triangle polygon is filled with the default pattern of B_SOLID_HIGH:\\nFillPolygon(aPolygon);\\n\\nAs you\\'ve come to expect from the BView StrokeXxx() and FillXxx() routines, both StrokePolygon() and FillPolygon() may include an optional pattern polygon that specifies a pattern to use for the outline or fill of the polygon.\\nFinally, you can include yet one more optional parameter in the polygon drawing\\nroutines--a bool value that indicates whether the final shape-closing line should\\nor shouldn\\'t be drawn. By default, this line is drawn to finish up the polygon. If\\nfalse is passed, a series of connected lines rather than a polygon will be drawn.\\nDrawing a triangle\\nOn the previous pages you saw how to define and draw a triangle using a\\nBPolygon object. The BeOS also provides a shortcut for working with this special\\ncase of a polygon. It\\'s useful because so many 3D objects are built from dozens of\\ntiny triangles. Instead of defining an array of points and adding those points to a\\nBPolygon object, you can forego the both these steps and simply call one of two\\nBView member functions: StrokeTriangle() or FillTriangle(). Pass the\\nthree BPoint objects that define the triangle\\'s vertices. Here, the same triangle that\\nwas drawn using a BPolygon object is drawn using a call to StrokeTriangle():\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nAs expected, FillTriangle() is invoked in the same manner as\\nStrokeTriangle(). Again as expected, both functions accept an optional pattern parameter.\\n\\nRegions\\nA region groups a number of rectangles together into a single BRegion object.\\nThis object can then be manipulated as a unitrotated, colored, and so forth. The\\nrectangles that make up a region can vary in size, and can be defined such that\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nthey form one continuous shape or any number of seemingly unrelated shapes. In\\nFigure 5-14, a window has been divided into four areas. Each area holds a single\\nregion. That last point is worthy of repeating: the window holds four regions. The\\nrectangles in the area at the bottom left of the window don\\'t form a single, solid\\narea, but because they\\'ve been marked to all be a part of a single BRegion object,\\nthey collectively make up a single region. The same applies to the rectangles in\\nthe lower right area of the window.\\n\\nFigure 5-14. A window displaying four regions\\n\\nSetting up a region\\nTo set up a region, first create a new BRegion object. Then define a rectangle and\\nadd that rectangle to the BRegion. In the following snippet, two rectangles are\\ndefined and added to a BRegion object named aRegion:\\nBRect\\nBRegion\\n\\naRect;\\n*aRegion;\\n\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\n\\nDrawing a region\\nCreating a region and adding rectangles to it defines the area (or areas) the region\\noccupies. It doesn\\'t, however, display the region in a view. To do that, invoke the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBView member function FillRegion(). Here, the region that was created in the\\nprevious snippet is filled with the default B_SOLID_HIGH pattern:\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\n\\nThe BRegion object keeps track of all of the constituent rectangles and is responsible for filling each. Like other FillXxx() functions FillRegion() allows you\\nto specify an optional pattern.\\n\\nThere is no StrokeRegion() member function in the BView class.\\nBecause a region can consist of any number of overlapping rectangles, outlining each individual rectangle would result in lines running through the contents of the region.\\n\\nTesting for inclusion in a region\\nOne important use of a region is to test where a point lies within an area. If a\\npoint lies in any one of the rectangles that defines a region, that point is considered a part of, or belonging to, the region. To test a point for inclusion in a region,\\ncall the BRegion member function Contains(). Pass this routine the BPoint\\nobject to test, and Contains() will return a bool value that indicates whether or\\nnot the tested point lies within the region. In this next snippet, a region consisting\\nof just a single rectangle is defined. A point is then defined and tested for inclusion in this region:\\nBRect\\nBRegion\\nBPoint\\n\\n*aRegion;\\n\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\nif (aRegion->Contains(aPoint))\\n// do something\\nelse\\n// do something else\\n\\nRegion example project\\nThe Region project results in a program that displays a window like the one\\nshown in Figure 5-15.\\nThe dark area in Figure 5-15 represents a single region composed of three\\nrectangles. The MyDrawView member function Draw() defines and adds each\\nrectangle in turn to the BRegion object. After all of the rectangles have been\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nFigure 5-15. The window that results from running the Region program\\n\\nadded, FillRegion() is called to fill the entire region with the default pattern of\\nB_SOLID_HIGH:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nBRegion *aRegion;\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\n}\\n\\nRegion point testing example project\\nWhile the region shown in Figure 5-15 is filled, it doesn\\'t have to be. By omitting a\\ncall to FillRegion(), it\\'s possible to define a region without making it visible.\\nOne practical reason for doing this is for testing mouse button hits. If your program needs to find out whether the user clicked in a particular area of a window--even a very irregularly shaped area--a region that includes the entire area\\nto test can be set up. The BRegion class includes a routine that tests for the inclusion of a BPoint. The BView member function MouseDown() provides your application with a BPoint object that holds the pixel location of the cursor at the time\\nof a mouse button click. By overriding a view\\'s MouseDown() function and implementing it such that it compares the cursor location with the area of the region,\\nyour program can easily respond to mouse button clicks in an area of any shape.\\nThe RegionTest project creates a program that draws a region to a window--the\\nsame region created by the Region example project and pictured in Figure 5-15.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nWhat\\'s been added is the ability to test for a mouse button click in the region. If\\nthe user clicks anywhere in the dark area, the system beep is played. Clicking in\\nthe window but outside of the region produces no effect.\\nTo let the MyDrawView view (which occupies the entire area of the window it\\nresides in) respond to mouse button clicks, the program overrides MouseDown().\\nTo enable a MyDrawView object to keep track of its region, a BRegion object has\\nbeen added as a private data member in the MyDrawView class. Here\\'s the new\\ndeclaration of the MyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBRegion\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n*fThreeRectRegion;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIn the previous example (the Region project), the region was set up in the Draw()\\nfunction. Because in that project the MyDrawView class didn\\'t retain the information about the region (it didn\\'t define a BRegion object as a data member), it was\\nnecessary to recalculate the region\\'s area each time the view it resided in needed\\nupdating. Now that the view retains this information, the BRegion needs to be set\\nup only once. The MyDrawView constructor is used for that purpose:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nfThreeRectRegion = new BRegion();\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nWith the BRegion construction moved to the MyDrawView constructor, the implementation of the MyDrawView member function Draw() is reduced to nothing\\nmore than a call to FillRegion():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\nFillRegion(fThreeRectRegion);\\n\\n}\\n\\nImplementing the MouseDown() routine for the MyDrawView class is as easy as\\ncomparing the cursor location (supplied by the system when it automatically\\ninvokes MouseDown()) to the area of the region. The BRegion member function\\nContains() handles that task:\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nif (fThreeRectRegion->Contains(point))\\nbeep();\\n}\\n\\nIf the cursor is over any part of the region when the mouse button is clicked, the\\ncomputer beeps. Your more sophisticated program will of course find something\\nmore interesting to do in response to the user clicking the mouse button in a\\nregion!\\n\\nPictures\\nNow that you know about the myriad shapes the BeOS allows you to draw, you\\'ll\\nappreciate the BPicture class. A BPicture object consists of any number of\\nshapes of any type. Once defined, this combination of one, two, or hundreds of\\nshapes can be quickly drawn and redrawn with a single function call.\\nSetting up a picture\\nA picture object is created by using new to allocate memory for an empty, temporary BPicture. The creation of the new object takes place within a call to the\\nBView member function BeginPicture(). Doing so instructs the view to store\\nthe results of subsequent calls to BView drawing functions in the picture object, as\\nopposed to drawing the results of the calls to the view (as is normally the case).\\nWhen the picture is considered complete, the BView member function\\nEndPicture() is called. This routine returns the completed temporary picture\\nobject. This temporary object should be assigned to an application-defined\\nBPicture object. The following snippet provides an example:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nFillRect(aRect);\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFor simplicity, the previous snippet defines a picture that consists of a small filledin rectangle and a short, horizontal line. Your own pictures may prove to be far\\nmore complex. In particular, you\\'ll want to include calls such as SetFont(),\\nSetPenSize(), and so forth in order to set up the drawing environment appropriate to your drawing. If such calls aren\\'t made, the state of the view\\'s drawing environment at the time the picture is created will be used when the picture is later\\ndrawn.\\n\\nThe previous snippet indents the code between the\\nBeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls for purely aesthetic reasons. Doing so isn\\'t necessary, but it does make it obvious just what\\ncode the picture object consists of.\\n\\nCompleting a picture by calling EndPicture() doesn\\'t prohibit you from adding\\nto that same picture at a later time. To add to an existing BPicture object, pass\\nthat object to BeginPicture() and start drawing. After calling EndPicture(),\\nthe new drawing code will be a part of the existing picture. Here the previous picture-creating snippet is repeated. After the picture is completed, it is reopened and\\na vertical line is added to it:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nFillRect(aRect);_\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n...\\n...\\nBeginPicture(aPicture);\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\nDrawing a picture\\nOnce defined, a picture is drawn by invoking the BView member function\\nDrawPicture(). Just pass the picture as the argument:\\nDrawPicture(aPicture);\\n\\nBefore calling DrawPicture(), specify the starting position of the picture by moving the pen to where the upper left corner should be. Alternately, a BPoint object\\ncan be passed to DrawPicture() to denote where drawing should start. Both\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\ntechniques are shown here. The result of executing the code will be two identical\\npictures, one beneath the other.\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\n// line and shape-drawing code here\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\nDrawPicture(aPicture);\\n\\nKeep in mind that if a picture hasn\\'t set up its drawing environment, the state of\\nthe view at the time the picture was created is used when the picture is drawn. If\\nthe view\\'s graphic state happened to be in its default state (a high color of black, a\\npen size of 1.0, and so forth), the drawing will be made as expected. However, if\\nany of the view\\'s graphic settings were altered at some point before the picture\\nwas created, the drawing of the picture may occur with unpredictable and undesirable effects. Consider the previous snippet. If a call to SetPenSize(10.0) had\\nbeen made somewhere before the call to BeginPicture(), any line drawing\\ndone by the aPicture picture would include lines with a thickness of 10 pixels.\\nThat most likely won\\'t be the desired effect. If the picture is to draw lines with a\\nthickness of 1 pixel, then a call to SetPenSize(1.0) should be made in the picture-defining code, like this:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\n// line and shape-drawing code here\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to keep track and reverse changes that are made to the drawing\\nenvironment by a picture. That is, after a call to EndPicture(), your code doesn\\'t\\nneed to restore the view\\'s environment to its pre-BeginPicture() state. That\\'s\\nbecause all environmental changes that are made between calls to\\nBeginPicture() and EndPicture() apply only to the picture, not to the view.\\nPicture example project\\nThe Picture project draws a number of cascading rectangles, as shown in\\nFigure 5-16.\\nFor this project I\\'ve added a private data member BPicture object named\\nfPicture to the MyDrawView class. In the MyDrawView member function\\nAttachedToWindow(), this picture is created and defined. A for loop is used to\\nset up the numerous offset rectangles that make up the picture.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-16. The window that results from running the Picture program\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i=0; i<80; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\n}\\n\\nWhile the temptation is to define the picture in the MyDrawView constructor (it is,\\nafter all, an initialization act), the code must instead appear in the\\nAttachedToWindow() routine. The BPicture definition relies on the current state\\nof the view the picture belongs to, and the view\\'s state isn\\'t completely set up\\nuntil AttachedToWindow() executes.\\nOnce the picture is set up and saved in the fPicture data member, a\\nMyDrawView object can make use of it. That\\'s done in the Draw() function, where\\na call to MovePenTo() ensures that the drawing will start in the top left corner of\\nthe view (and, because the view is the same size as the window, the top left corner of the window). A call to DrawPicture() performs the drawing:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawPicture(fPicture);\\n}\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Introduction to\\nControls\\n Buttons\\n Picture Buttons\\n Checkboxes\\n Radio Buttons\\n Text Fields\\n Multiple Control\\nExample Project\\n\\n6.\\n\\nControls and\\nMessages\\n\\nA control is a graphic image that resides in a window and acts as a device that\\naccepts user input. The BeOS API includes a set of classes that make it easy to add\\ncertain predefined controls to a program. These standard controls include the button, checkbox, radio button, text field, and color control. There\\'s also a Be-defined\\nclass that allows you to turn any picture into a control. That allows you to create\\ncontrols that have the look of real-world devices such as switches and dials.\\nChapter 5, Drawing, described the color control and the BColorControl class\\nused to create such controls. This chapter discusses other control types and the\\nclasses used to create each. Also discussed is the BControl class, the class from\\nwhich all other control classes are derived.\\nWhen the user clicks on a control, the system responds by sending a message to\\nthe window that holds the control. This message indicates exactly which control\\nhas been clicked. The message is received by the window\\'s MessageReceived()\\nhook function, where it is handled. Since the BWindow version of\\nMessageReceived() won\\'t know how to go about responding to messages that\\noriginate from your controls, you\\'ll override this routine. Your application then\\ngains control of how such messages are handled, and can include any code necessary to carry out the task you want the control to perform. This chapter includes\\nexamples that demonstrate how to create controls and how to override\\nMessageReceived() such that the function handles mouse clicks on controls of\\nany of the standard types.\\n\\nIntroduction to Controls\\nWhen a BWindow object receives a message, it either handles the message itself or\\nlets one of its views handle it. To handle a message, the window invokes a\\nBWindow hook function. For example, a B_ZOOM message delivered to a window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nresults in that window invoking the BWindow hook function Zoom() to shrink or\\nenlarge the window. To allocate the handling of a message to one of its views, the\\nwindow passes the message to the affected view, and the view then invokes the\\nappropriate BView hook function. For example, a B_MOUSE_DOWN message results\\nin the affected view invoking the BView hook function MouseDown().\\nBesides being the recipient of system messages, a window is also capable of\\nreceiving application-defined messages. This lets you implement controls in your\\napplication\\'s windows. When you create a control (such as a button object from\\nthe BButton class), define a unique message type that becomes associated with\\nthat one control. Also, add the control to a window. When the user operates the\\ncontrol (typically by clicking on it, as for a button), the system passes the application-defined message to the window. How the window handles the message is\\ndetermined by the code you include in the BWindow member function\\nMessageReceived().\\n\\nControl Types\\nYou can include a number of different types of controls in your windows. Each\\ncontrol is created from a class derived from the abstract class BControl. The\\nBControl class provides the basic features common to all controls, and the\\nBControl-derived classes add capabilities unique to each control type. In this\\nchapter, you\\'ll read about the following control types:\\nButton\\nThe BButton class is used to create a standard button, sometimes referred to\\nas a push button. Clicking on a button results in some immediate action taking place.\\nPicture button\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a button that can have any size,\\nshape, and look to it. While picture buttons can have an infinite variety of\\nlooks, they act in the same manner as a push button--a mouse click results in\\nan action taking place.\\nCheckbox\\nThe BCheckBox class creates a checkbox. A checkbox has two states: on and\\noff. Clicking a checkbox always toggles the control to its opposite state or\\nvalue. Clicking on a checkbox usually doesn\\'t immediately impact the program. Instead, a program typically waits until some other action takes place\\n(such as the click of a certain push button) before gathering the current state\\nof the checkbox. At that time, some program setting or feature is adjusted\\nbased on the value in the checkbox.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nRadio button\\nThe BRadioButton class is used to create a radio button. Like a checkbox, a\\nradio button has two states: on and off. Unlike a checkbox, a radio button is\\nnever found alone. Radio buttons are grouped together in a set that is used to\\ncontrol an option or feature of a program. Clicking on a radio button turns off\\nwhatever radio button was on at the time of the mouse click, and turns on the\\nnewly clicked radio button. Use a checkbox in a yes or no or true or false situation. Use radio buttons for a condition that offers multiple choices that are\\nmutually exclusive (since only one button can be on at any given time).\\nText field\\nThe BTextControl class is used to create a text field. A text field is a control\\nconsisting of a static string on the left and an editable text area on the right.\\nThe static text acts as a label that provides the user with information about\\nwhat is to be typed in the editable text area of the control. Typing text in the\\neditable text area of a control can have an immediate effect on the program,\\nbut it\\'s more common practice to wait until some other action takes place (like\\na click on a push button) before the program reads the user-entered text.\\nColor control\\nThe BColorControl class, shown in Chapter 5, creates color controls. A color\\ncontrol displays the 256 system colors, each in a small square. The user can\\nchoose a color by clicking on it. A program can, at any time, check to see\\nwhich color the user has currently selected, and perform some action based\\non that choice. Often the selected color is used in the next, or all subsequent,\\ndrawing operation the program performs.\\nFigure 6-1 shows four of the six types of controls available to you. In the upper\\nleft of the figure is a button. The control in the upper right is a text field. The\\nlower left of the figure shows a checkbox in both its on and off states, while the\\nlower right of the figure shows a radio button in both its states. A picture button\\ncan have any size and look you want, so it\\'s not shown. All the buttons are associated with labels that appear on or next to the controls themselves.\\nThe sixth control type, the color control based on the BColorControl class, isn\\'t\\nshown either--it was described in detail in Chapter 5 and will only be mentioned\\nin passing in this chapter.\\nA control can be in an enabled statewhere the user can interact with itor a\\ndisabled state. A disabled control will appear dim, and clicking on the control will\\nhave no effect. Figure 6-2 shows a button control in both its enabled state (leftmost in the figure) and its disabled state (rightmost in the figure). Also shown is\\nwhat an enabled button looks like when it is selected using the Tab key (middle\\nin the figure). A user can press the Tab key to cycle through controls, making each\\none in turn the current control. As shown in Figure 6-2, a button\\'s label will be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFigure 6-1. Examples of button, text field, checkbox, and radio button controls\\n\\nunderlined when it\\'s current. Once current, other key presses (typically the Return\\nand Enter key) affect that control.\\n\\nFigure 6-2. A button control that\\'s (from left to right) enabled, current, and disabled\\n\\nCreating a Control\\nA control is created from one of six Interface Kit classes--each of which is covered in detail in this chapter. Let us start by examining the BControl class from\\nwhich they are derived.\\nThe BControl class\\nThe BControl class is an abstract class derived from the BView and BInvoker\\nclasses. Control objects are created from BControl-derived classes, so all controls\\nare types of views.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to create controls that aren\\'t based on the BControl\\nclass. In fact, the Be API does that for the BListView and\\nBMenuItem classes. These are exceptions, though. You\\'ll do best by\\nbasing each of your application\\'s controls on one of the six\\nBControl-derived classes. Doing so means your controls will\\nbehave as expected by the user.\\n\\nBControl is an abstract class, so your project will create BControl-derived class\\nobjects rather than BControl objects. However, because the constructor of each\\nBControl-derived class invokes the BControl constructor, a study of the\\nBControl constructor is a worthwhile endeavor. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nBControl(BRect\\nconst char\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nFour of the six BControl constructor parameters match BView constructor parameters. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags arguments get passed to the\\nBView constructor by the BControl constructor. These parameters are discussed\\nin Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so here I\\'ll offer only a brief recap of\\ntheir purposes. The frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of\\nthe view. The name parameter establishes a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The resizingMode parameter is a mask that defines the behavior of the view should the size of the view\\'s parent view change. The flags\\nparameter is a mask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of notifications (such as update) the view is to be aware of.\\nThe remaining two BControl constructor parameters are specific to the control.\\nThe label parameter is a string that defines the text associated with it. For\\ninstance, for a button control, the label holds the words that appear on the button. The message parameter is a BMessage object that provides a means for the\\nsystem to recognize the control as a unique entity. When the control is selected by\\nthe user, it is this message that the system will send to the window that holds the\\ncontrol.\\nYour project won\\'t create BControl objects, so a sample call to the BControl\\nconstructor isn\\'t useful here. Instead, let\\'s look at the simplest type of BControlderived object: the BButton.\\nThe BButton class\\nCreating a new push button involves creating a new BButton object. The\\nBButton constructor parameters are an exact match of those used by the\\nBControl constructor:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor invokes the BControl constructor, passing all of its\\narguments to that routine. The BControl constructor uses the label argument to\\ninitialize the button\\'s label, and uses the message argument to assign a unique\\nmessage to the button. The BControl constructor then invokes the BView constructor, passing along the remaining four arguments it received from the BButton\\nconstructor. The BView constructor then sets up the button as a view. After the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nBControl and BView constructors have executed, the BButton constructor carries on with its creation of a button object by implementing button-specific tasks.\\nThis is, in essence, how the constructor for each of the BControl-derived classes\\nworks.\\nCreating a button\\nA button is created by defining the arguments that are passed to the BButton constructor and then invoking that constructor using new. To become functional, the\\nbutton must then be added to a window. That\\'s what\\'s taking place in this snippet:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nconst char* buttonName = \"OKButton\";\\nconst char* buttonLabel = \"OK\";\\nBButton\\n*buttonOK;\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonOK);\\n\\nIn the above code, the BRect variable buttonRect defines the size and location\\nof the button. This push button will be 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels high. The\\nbuttonName string gives the button the name \"OKButton.\" This is the name used\\nto locate and access the button by view name using the BView member function\\nFindView(). The name that actually appears on the button itself, \"OK,\" is defined\\nby the buttonLabel string. The message associated with the new button control\\nis a new BMessage object of type BUTTON_OK_MSG. I\\'ll explain the BMessage class\\nin a minute. Here it suffices to say that, as shown above, creating a new message\\ncan be as easy as defining a four-character string and passing this constant to the\\nBMessage constructor.\\nThe BButton constructor prototype lists six parameters, yet the above invocation\\nof that constructor passes only four arguments. The fifth and sixth parameters,\\nresizingMode and flags, offer default values that are used when these arguments are omitted. The default resizingMode value (B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP) creates a button that will remain a fixed distance from the left and\\ntop edges of the control\\'s parent view should the parent view be resized. The\\ndefault flags value (B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE) specifies that the control\\nneeds to be redrawn if altered, and that it can become the focus view in response\\nto keyboard actions.\\nAdding a control to a window means adding the control to a view. In the above\\nsnippet, it\\'s assumed that a view (perhaps an object of the application-defined\\nBView-derived MyDrawView class) has already been created.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nEnabling and disabling a control\\nWhen a control is created, it is initially enabled--the user can click on the control\\nto select it. If you want a control to be disabled, invoke the control\\'s\\nSetEnabled() member function. The following line of code disables the\\nbuttonOK button control that was created in the previous snippet:\\nbuttonOK->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nSetEnabled() can be invoked on a control at any time, but if the control is to\\nstart out disabled, call SetEnabled() before displaying the window the control\\nappears in. To again enable a control, call SetEnabled() with an argument of\\ntrue.\\nThis chapter\\'s CheckBoxNow project demonstrates the enabling and disabling of a\\nbutton. The technique in that example can be used on any type of control.\\nTurning a control on and off\\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are two-state controls--they can be on or off.\\nWhen a control of either of these two types is created, it is initially off. If you want\\nthe control on (to check a checkbox or fill in a radio button), invoke the\\nBControl member function SetValue(). Passing SetValue() the Be-defined\\nconstant B_CONTROL_ON sets the control to on. Turning a control on and off in\\nresponse to a user action in the control is the responsibility of the system--not\\nyour program. So after creating a control and setting it to the state you want, you\\nwill seldom need to call SetValue(). If you want your program to \"manually\"\\nturn a control off (as opposed to doing so in response to a user action), have the\\ncontrol invoke its SetValue() function with an argument of B_CONTROL_OFF.\\nA button is a one-state device, so turning a button on or off doesn\\'t make sense.\\nInstead, this snippet turns on a two-state control--a checkbox:\\nrequirePasswordCheckBox->SetValue(B_CONTROL_ON)\\n\\nCreating checkboxes hasn\\'t been covered yet, so you\\'ll want to look at the CheckBox example project later in this chapter to see the complete code for creating and\\nturning on a checkbox.\\n\\nTechnically, a button is also a two-state control. When it is not being\\nclicked, it\\'s off. When the control is being clicked (and before the\\nuser releases the mouse button), it\\'s on. This point is merely an\\naside, though, as it\\'s unlikely that your program will ever need to\\ncheck the state of a button in the way it will check the state of a\\ncheckbox or radio button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo check the current state of a control, invoke the BControl member function\\nValue(). This routine returns an int32 value that is either B_CONTROL_ON (which\\nis defined to be 1) or B_CONTROL_OFF (which is defined to be 0). This snippet\\nobtains the current state of a checkbox, then compares the value of the state to the\\nBe-defined constant B_CONTROL_ON:\\n\\ncontrolState;\\n\\ncontrolState = requirePasswordCheckBox->Value();\\nif (controlState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// password required, display password text field\\n\\nChanging a control\\'s label\\nBoth checkboxes and radio buttons have a label that appears to the right of the\\ncontrol. A text field has a label to the left of the control. The control\\'s label is set\\nwhen the control is created, but it can be changed on the fly.\\nThe BControl member function SetLabel() accepts a single argument: the text\\nthat is to be used in place of the control\\'s existing label. In this next snippet, a\\nbutton\\'s label is initially set to read \"Click,\" but is changed to the string \"Click\\nAgain\" at some point in the program\\'s execution:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonName = \"ClickButton\";\\n*buttonLabel = \"Click\";\\n*buttonClick;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_CLICK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonClick);\\n...\\n...\\nbuttonClick->SetLabel(\"Click Again\");\\n\\nThe labels of other types of controls are changed in the same manner. The last\\nexample project in this chapter, the TextField project, sets the label of a button to\\na string entered by the user.\\n\\nHandling a Control\\nBControl-derived classes take care of some of the work of handling a control. For\\ninstance, in order to properly update a control in response to a mouse button\\nclick, your program doesn\\'t have to keep track of the control\\'s current state, and it\\ndoesn\\'t have to include any code to set the control to the proper state (such as\\ndrawing or erasing the check mark in a checkbox). What action your program\\ntakes in response to a mouse button click is, however, your program\\'s responsibility. When the user clicks on a control, a message will be delivered to the affected\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nwindow. That message will be your program\\'s prompt to perform whatever action\\nis appropriate.\\nMessages and the BMessage class\\nWhen the Application Server delivers a system message to an application\\nwindow, that message arrives in the form of a BMessage object. Your code determines how to handle a system message simply by overriding a BView hook function (such as MouseDown()). Because the routing of a message from the Application Server to a window and then possibly to a view\\'s hook function is\\nautomatically handled for you, the fact that the message is a BMessage object may\\nnot have been important (or even known) to you. A control also makes use of a\\nBMessage object. However, in the case of a control, you need to know a little bit\\nabout working with BMessage objects.\\nThe BMessage class defines a message object as a container that holds information. Referring to the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book, you\\'ll find that this information consists of a name, some number of\\nbytes of data, and a type code. You\\'ll be pleased to find out that when using a\\nBMessage in conjunction with a control, a thorough knowledge of these details of\\nthe BMessage class isn\\'t generally necessary (complex applications aside). Instead,\\nall you need to know of this class is how to create a BMessage object. The snippet a few pages back that created a BButton object illustrated how that\\'s done:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\n// variable declarations here\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nThe only information you need to create a BMessage object is a four-character literal, as in the above definition of BUTTON_OK_MSG as `btmg\\'. This value, which\\nwill serve as the what field of the message, is actually a uint32. So you can\\ndefine the constant as an unsigned 32-bit integer, though most programmers find it\\neasier to remember a literal than the unsigned numeric equivalent. This value then\\nbecomes the argument to the BMessage constructor in the BButton constructor.\\nThis newly created message object won\\'t hold any other information.\\nThe BMessage class defines a single public data member named what. The what\\ndata member holds the four-character string that distinguishes the message from all\\nother message types--including system messages--the application will use. In the\\nprevious snippet, the constant btmg becomes the what data member of the\\nBMessage object created when invoking the BButton constructor.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nWhen the program refers to a system message by its Be-defined constant, such as\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED or B_KEY_DOWN, what\\'s really of interest is the what data\\nmember of the system message. The value of each Be-defined message constant is\\na four-character string composed of a combination of only uppercase characters\\nand, optionally, one or more underscore characters. Here\\'s how Be defines a few\\nof the system message constants:\\nenum {\\nB_ABOUT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n...\\n...\\n};\\n\\n= \\'_ABR\\',\\n\\n= \\'_QRQ\\',\\n\\n= \\'_MDN\\',\\n\\nBe intentionally uses the message constant value convention of uppercase-only\\ncharacters and underscores to make it obvious that a message is a system message. You can easily avoid duplicating a Be-defined message constant by simply\\nincluding one or more lowercase characters in the literal of your own applicationdefined message constants. And to make it obvious that a message isn\\'t a Bedefined one, don\\'t start the message constant name with \"B_\". In this book\\'s\\nexamples, I have chosen to use a fairly informative convention in choosing symbols for application-defined control messages: start with the control type, include a\\nword or words descriptive of what action the control results in, and end with\\n\"MSG\" for \"message.\" The value of each constant may hint at the message type\\n(for instance, `plSD\\' for \"play sound\"), but aside from avoiding all uppercase characters, the value is somewhat arbitrary. These two examples illustrate the convention I use:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_PLAY_SOUND_MSG\\nCALCULATE_VALUES\\n\\n\\'plSD\\'\\n\\'calc\\'\\n\\nMessages and the MessageReceived() member function\\nThe BWindow class is derived from the BLooper class, so a window is a type of\\nlooper--an object that runs a message loop that receives messages from the Application Server. The BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, so a window is also a handler--an object that can handle messages that are dispatched\\nfrom a message loop. A window can both receive messages and handle them.\\nFor the most part, system messages are handled automatically; for instance, when\\na B_ZOOM message is received, the operating system zooms the window. But you\\ncannot completely entrust the handling of an application-defined message to the\\nsystem.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nWhen a user selects a control, the Application Server delivers a message object\\nwith the appropriate what data member value to the affected BWindow object.\\nYou\\'ve just seen a snippet that created a BButton associated with a BMessage\\nobject. That BMessage had a what data member of `btmg\\'. If the user clicked on\\nthe button that results from this object, the Application Server would deliver such\\na message to the affected BWindow. It\\'s up to the window to include code that\\nwatches for, and responds to, this type of message. The BWindow class member\\nfunction MessageReceived() is used for this purpose.\\nWhen an application-defined message reaches a window, it looks for a\\nMessageReceived() function. This routine receives the message, examines the\\nmessage\\'s what data member, and responds depending on its value. The\\nBHandler class defines such a MessageReceived() function. The BHandlerderived class BWindow inherits this function and overrides it. The BWindow version includes a call to the base class BHandler version, thus augmenting what\\nBHandler offers. If the BWindow version of MessageReceived() can\\'t handle a\\nmessage, it passes it up to the BHandler version of this routine. Figure 6-3 shows\\nhow a message that can\\'t be handled by one version of MessageReceived() gets\\npassed up to the next version of this function.\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBHandler\\nversion\\nmessage\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow\\nversion\\nmessage\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nmessage\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow-derived\\nversion\\n\\nFigure 6-3. Message passed to parent class\\'s version of MessageReceived()\\n\\nHere is how the MessageReceived() looks in BWindow:\\nvoid BWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle B_KEY_DOWN and scripting-related system messages\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\ndefault:\\nBHandler::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nYour project\\'s windows won\\'t be based directly on the BWindow class. Instead,\\nwindows will be objects of a class you derive from BWindow. While such a\\nBWindow-derived class will inherit the BWindow version of MessageReceived(),\\nthat version of the function won\\'t suffice--it won\\'t know anything about the application-defined messages you\\'ve paired with the window\\'s controls. Your BWindowderived class should thus do what the BWindow class does: override the inherited\\nversion of MessageReceived() and, within the new implementation of this function, invoke the inherited version:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle application-defined messages\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhat messages your BWindow-derived class version of MessageReceived() looks\\nfor depends on the controls you\\'re adding to windows of that class type. If I add a\\nsingle button to windows of the MyHelloWindow class, and the button\\'s BButton\\nconstructor pairs a message object with a what constant of BUTTON_OK_MSG (as\\nshown in previous snippets), the MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived()\\nwould look like this:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\n// handle a click on the OK button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe particular code that appears under the control\\'s case label depends entirely\\non what action you want to occur in response to the control being clicked. For\\nsimplicity, assume that we want a click on the OK button to do nothing more than\\nsound a beep. The completed version of MessageReceived() looks like this:\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nButtons\\nThe BButton class is used to create a button--a labeled push button that is operated when the button is clicked. The previous sections used the BButton class\\nand button objects for its specific examples and in its code snippets. That section\\nprovided some background on creating and working with buttons, so the emphasis here will be on incorporating the button-related code in a project.\\n\\nCreating a Button\\nThe BButton constructor has six parameters, each of which was described in the\\n\"The BButton class\" section of this chapter:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor calls the BControl constructor, which in turn calls the\\nBView constructor. Together, these routines set up and initialize a BButton object.\\nAfter attaching the button to a window, the height of the button may automatically be adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the button\\'s label and\\nthe border of the button. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates result in\\na button that isn\\'t high enough, the BButton constructor will increase the button\\nheight by increasing the value of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact\\nheight of the button depends on the font in which the button label is displayed.\\nFor the example button creation code, assume that a window is keeping track of\\nBView and BButton objects in data members named fView and fButton, respectively, and that the button\\'s message type is defined by the constant BUTTON_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_MSG\\n\\n\\'bttn\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nprivate:\\nBView\\nBButton\\n\\n*fView;\\n*fButton;\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe code that creates a new button and adds it to the view fView might then look\\nlike this:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, \"MyButton\",\\n\"Click Me\", new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfView->AddChild(fButton);\\n\\nMaking a Button the Default Button\\nOne button in a window can be made the default button--a button that the user\\ncan select either by clicking or by pressing the Enter key. If a button is the default\\nbutton, it is given a wider border so that the user recognizes it as such a button.\\nTo make a button the default button, call the BButton member function\\nMakeDefault():\\nfButton->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nIf the window that holds the new default button already had a default button, the\\nold default button automatically loses its default status and becomes a \"normal\"\\nbutton. The system handles this task to ensure that a window has only one default\\nbutton.\\nWhile granting one button default status may be a user-friendly gesture, it might\\nalso not make sense in many cases. Thus, a window isn\\'t required to have a\\ndefault button.\\n\\nButton Example Project\\nThe TwoButtons project demonstrates how to create a window that holds two buttons. Looking at Figure 6-4, you can guess that a click on the leftmost button\\n(which is the default button) results in the playing of the system sound a single\\ntime, while a click on the other button produces the beep twice.\\nPreparing the window class for the buttons\\nA few additions to the code in the MyHelloWindow.h file are in order. First, a pair\\nof constants are defined to be used later when the buttons are created. The choice\\nof constant names and values is unimportant, provided that the names don\\'t begin\\nwith \"B_\" and that the constant values don\\'t consist of all uppercase characters.\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-4. The window that results from running the TwoButtons program\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s two buttons, a pair of data members of type\\nBButton are added to the already present data member of type MyDrawView. And\\nnow that the window will be receiving and responding to application-defined\\nmessages, the BWindow-inherited member function MessageReceived() needs to\\noverridden:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the buttons\\nThe buttons are created and added to the window in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, the constructor declares several variables that will be\\nused in the pair of calls to the BButton constructor and assigns them values:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*buttonBeep2Label = \"Beep Two\";\\n\\nIn the past, you\\'ve seen that I normally declare a variable within the routine that\\nuses it, just before its use. Here I\\'ve declared the six variables that are used as\\nBButton constructor arguments outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor--but\\nthey could just as well have been declared within the MyHelloWindow constructor. I opted to do things this way to get in the habit of grouping all of a window\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nlayout-defining code together. Grouping all the button boundary rectangles,\\nnames, and labels together makes it easier to lay out the buttons in relation to one\\nanother and to supply them with logical, related names and labels. This technique\\nis especially helpful when a window holds several controls.\\nThe buttons will be added to the fMyView view. Recall that this view is of the\\nBView-derived application-defined class MyDrawView and occupies the entire content area of a MyHelloWindow. In the MyHelloWindow constructor, the view is\\ncreated first, and then the buttons are created and added to the view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling button clicks\\nMessageReceived() always has a similar format. The Application Server passes\\nthis function a message as an argument. The message data member what holds\\nthe message type, so that data member should be examined in a switch statement, with the result compared to any application-defined message types the window is capable of handling. A window of type MyHelloWindow can handle a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_1_MSG and a BUTTON_BEEP_2_MSG. If a different type of message is\\nencountered, it gets passed on to the BWindow version of MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPicture Buttons\\nA picture button is a button that has a picture on its face rather than a text label.\\nThe picture button behaves like a standard push button--clicking and releasing\\nthe mouse button while over the picture button selects it.\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a picture button. Associated with one\\nBPictureButton object are two BPicture objects. One of the pictures acts as the\\nbutton when the button is in its normal state (that is, when the user isn\\'t clicking\\non it). The other picture acts as the button when the user clicks on the button.\\nYou\\'ll supply a BPictureButton object with the two pictures, and the system will\\nbe responsible for switching back and forth between the pictures in response to\\nthe user\\'s actions.\\n\\nCreating a Picture Button\\nA picture button is created by the BPictureButton constructor. As is the case for\\nother controls, this constructor invokes the BControl constructor, which in turn\\ninvokes the BView constructor:\\nBPictureButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*off,\\n*on,\\n*message,\\nbehavior = B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BPictureButton constructor has eight parameters, five of which you\\'re\\nalready familiar with. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags parameters\\nget passed to the BView constructor and are used in setting up the picture button\\nas a view. The message parameter is used by the BControl constructor to assign\\na message type to the picture button. The remaining three parameters, off, on,\\nand behavior, are specific to the creation of a picture button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nThe off and on parameters are BPicture objects that define the two pictures to\\nbe used to display the button. In Chapter 5, you saw how to create a BPicture\\nobject using the BPicture member functions BeginPicture() and\\nEndPicture(). Here I create a picture composed of a white circle within a black\\ncircle:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\n\\nA second BPicture object should then be created in the same way. These two\\nBPicture objects could then be used as the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBPictureButton constructor.\\n\\nFor more compelling graphic images, you can use bitmaps for button pictures. Once a bitmap exists, all that needs to appear between\\nthe BeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls is a call to the BView\\nmember function DrawBitMap(). Chapter 10, Files, discusses bitmaps.\\n\\nPicture buttons are actually more versatile than described in this section. Here the\\npicture button is treated as a one-state device--just as a standard push button is.\\nThe BPictureButton class can also be used, however, to create a picture button\\nthat is a two-state control. Setting the behavior parameter to the constant B_TWO_\\nSTATE_BUTTON tells the BPictureButton constructor to create a picture button\\nthat, when clicked on, toggles between the two pictures represented by the\\nBPicture parameters off and on. Clicking on such a picture button displays one\\npicture. Clicking on the button again displays the second picture. The displayed\\npicture indicates to the user the current state of the button. To see a good realworld use of a two-state picture button, run the BeIDE. Then choose Find from\\nthe Edit menu. In the lower-left area of the Find window you\\'ll find a button that\\nhas a picture of a small file icon on it. Click on the button and it will now have a\\npicture of two small file icons on it. This button is used to toggle between two\\nsearch options: search only the currently open, active file, and search all files\\npresent in the Find window list. Figure 6-5 shows both of this button\\'s two states.\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe two states of the same\\npicture button\\n\\nFigure 6-5. The Find window of the BeIDE provides an example of a picture button\\n\\nPicture Button Example Project\\nThe PictureButton project creates a program that displays a window that holds a\\nsingle picture button. Figure 6-6 shows this one window under two different conditions. The leftmost window in the figure shows the button in its normal state.\\nThe rightmost window shows that when the button is clicked it gets slightly\\nsmaller and its center is filled in.\\n\\nFigure 6-6. The window that results from running the PictureButton program\\n\\nThe picture button can include other pictures, which will be used if\\nthe program lets the button be disabled. Now that you know the\\nbasics of working with the BPictureButton class, the details of\\nenhancing your picture buttons will be a quick read in the\\nBPictureButton section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be\\nBook.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the picture button\\nThis chapter\\'s TwoButtons example project (presented in the \"Buttons\" section)\\nprovided a plan for adding a control, and support of that control, to a window.\\nHere\\'s how the window class header file (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this\\nproject) is set up for a new control:\\n\\n\\nDefine a constant to be used to represent an application-defined message type\\n\\n\\n\\nOverride MessageReceived() in the window class declaration\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a control data member in the window class declaration\\n\\nHere\\'s how the MyHelloWindow class is affected by the addition of a picture button to a window of this class type:\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fPicButtonBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nI\\'ve defined the PICTURE_BEEP_MSG constant to have a value of\\n\\'bep1\\'. Looking back at the TwoButtons example project, you\\'ll see\\nthat this is the same value I gave to that project\\'s BUTTON_BEEP_1_\\nMSG constant. If both controls were present in the same application,\\nI\\'d give one of these two constants a different value so that the\\nMessageReceived() function could distinguish between a click on\\nthe Beep One push button and a click on the picture button.\\n\\nCreating the picture button\\nThe process of creating a control can also be expressed in a number of steps. All\\nof the following affect the window source code file (the MyHelloWindow.cpp file\\nin this particular example):\\n\\n\\nDeclare and assign values to the variables to be used in the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate the control using new and the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach the control to the window by adding it to one of the window\\'s views\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nFollowing the above steps to add a picture button to the MyHelloWindow constructor results in a new version of this routine that looks like this:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n*buttonOnPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect offRect;\\nfMyView->FillRect(offRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(offRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect onRect;\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOnPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfPicButtonBeep = new BPictureButton(pictureBeep1Rect, pictureBeep1Name,\\nbuttonOffPict, buttonOnPict,\\nnew BMessage(PICTURE_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fPicButtonBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe two BPicture objects are defined using a few of the basic drawing techniques covered in Chapter 5. As you read the following, refer back to the picture\\nbutton in its off state (normal, or unclicked) and on state (being clicked) in\\nFigure 6-5.\\nThe off picture fills in a rectangle with the B_SOLID_LOW pattern (solid white) to\\nerase the on picture that might currently be displayed (if the user has just clicked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nthe picture button, the on picture will be serving as the picture button). Then a\\nrectangle is outlined to serve as the off button.\\nThe on picture erases the off picture (should it be currently drawn to the window\\nas the picture button) by drawing a white (B_SOLID_LOW) rectangle outline with\\nthe boundaries of the off picture rectangle. That rectangle is then inset two pixels\\nin each direction and a new rectangle is framed in black (B_SOLID_HIGH). The\\nrectangle is then inset two more pixels, and this new area is filled with black.\\nHandling a picture button click\\nTo handle a click on the picture button, MessageReceived() now looks for a\\nmessage of type PICTURE_BEEP_MSG. Should that message reach the window, the\\ncomputer sounds the system beep one time:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckboxes\\nThe BCheckBox class is used to add checkboxes to a window. A BCheckBox\\nobject includes both the checkbox itself and a label, or title, to the right of the\\nbox. A checkbox is a two-state control: in the on state, the checkbox has an \"X\" in\\nit; when off, it is empty. When a user clicks on a checkbox, its state is toggled. It\\'s\\nworthy of note that a checkbox label is considered a part of the checkbox control. That means that a user\\'s click on the checkbox itself or anywhere on the\\ncheckbox label will toggle the checkbox to its opposite state.\\nWhether a click results in a checkbox being turned on (checked) or off\\n(unchecked), a message is sent to the window that holds the checkbox. While a\\nprogram can immediately respond to a click on a checkbox, it is more typical for\\nthe program to wait until some other action takes place before responding. For\\ninstance, the setting of some program feature could be done via a checkbox.\\nClicking the checkbox wouldn\\'t, however, immediately change the setting. Instead,\\nwhen the user dismisses the window the checkbox resides in, the value of the\\ncheckbox can be queried and the setting of the program feature could be performed at that time.\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nCreating a Checkbox\\nThe BCheckBox constructor has six parameters:\\nBCheckBox(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BCheckBox parameters match those used in the BButton constructor--if you\\nknow how to create a button, you know how to create a checkbox. Adding to the\\nsimilarities is that after you attach the checkbox to a window, the control\\'s height\\nwill be automatically adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the control\\'s label. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates don\\'t produce a\\nrectangle with a height sufficient to display the checkbox label, the BCheckBox\\nconstructor will increase the checkbox boundary rectangle height by increasing the\\nvalue of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact height of the checkbox\\ndepends on the font in which the control\\'s label is displayed.\\nAs for other control types, you\\'ll define a message constant that is to be paired\\nwith the control. For instance:\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_MSG\\n\\n\\'ckbx\\'\\n\\nThen, optionally, add a data member of the control type to the class declaration of\\nthe window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBButton\\n*fCheckBox;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet is typical of the code you\\'ll write to create a new checkbox\\nand add that control to a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfCheckBox = new BCheckBox(checkBoxRect,\"MyCheckbox\"\\n\"Check Me\", new BMessage(CHECKBOX_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBox);\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Now) Example Project\\nClicking a checkbox may have an immediate effect on some aspect of the program, or it may not have an impact on the program until the user confirms the\\ncheckbox selection--usually by a click on a button. The former use of a check-\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nbox is demonstrated in the example project described here: CheckBoxNow. For an\\nexample of the other usage, a checkbox that has an effect after another action is\\ntaken, look over the next example, the CheckBoxLater project.\\nThe use of a checkbox to initiate an immediate action is often in practice when\\nsome area of the window the checkbox resides in is to be altered. For instance, if\\nsome controls in a window are to be rendered unusable in certain conditions, a\\ncheckbox can be used to disable (and then later enable) these controls. This is\\nhow the checkbox in the CheckBoxNow example works. The CheckBoxNow\\nproject creates a program with a window that holds two controls: a button and a\\ncheckbox. When the program launches, both controls are enabled, and the checkbox is unchecked--as shown in the top window in Figure 6-7. As expected, clicking on the Beep One button produces a single system beep. Clicking on the\\ncheckbox disables beeping by disabling the button. The bottom window in\\nFigure 6-7 shows how the program\\'s one window looks after clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox.\\n\\nFigure 6-7. The windows that result from running the CheckBoxNow program\\n\\nPreparing the Window class for the checkbox\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h file prepares for the window\\'s support of a button and a\\ncheckbox by defining a constant for each control\\'s message:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'stbp\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class now holds three data members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nBButton\\nBCheckBox\\n\\n*fCheckBoxSetBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the checkbox\\nI\\'ve declared and initialized the button and checkbox boundary rectangles near\\none another so that I could line them up--Figure 6-6 shows that the checkbox is\\njust to the right of the button and centered vertically with the button.\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*checkBoxSetBeepName = \"SetBeep\";\\n= \"Beep One\";\\n*checkBoxSetBeepLabel = \"Disable Beeping\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates both the button and checkbox:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfCheckBoxSetBeep = new BCheckBox(checkBoxSetBeepRect, checkBoxSetBeepName,\\ncheckBoxSetBeepLabel,\\nnew BMessage(CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBoxSetBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a checkbox click\\nWhen the checkbox is clicked, the system will toggle it to its opposite state and\\nthen send a message of the application-defined type CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG to\\nthe MyHelloWindow MessageReceived() routine. In response, this message\\'s\\ncase section obtains the new state of the checkbox and enables or disables the\\nBeep One button as appropriate. If the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, or\\non, the button is disabled by passing a value of false to the button\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nSetEnabled() routine. If the checkbox is unchecked, or off, a value of true is\\npassed to this same routine in order to enable the button:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, deactivate beep button\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, activate beep button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Later) Example Project\\nThe CheckBoxNow project responds immediately to a click on a checkbox. More\\noften, programs let users check or uncheck the checkboxes without any immediate effect. Thus, your program might reserve action until the choice is confirmed\\nby the user\\'s click on a button (such as OK, Done, or Accept). The CheckBoxLater project demonstrates this approach. Figure 6-7 shows that the CheckBoxLater program displays a window that looks similar to that displayed by the\\nCheckBoxNow program. The program differs in when the state of the checkbox is\\nqueried by the program. In the CheckBoxLater program, clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox any number of times has no immediate effect on the Beep One\\nbutton (in Figure 6-8, you see that the checkbox is checked, yet the button isn\\'t\\ndisabled). It\\'s only when the user clicks the Beep One button that the program\\nchecks to see if the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked. If it isn\\'t checked, the\\nbutton click plays the system beep. If it is checked, the button can still be clicked,\\nbut no sound will be played.\\nThe only changes that were made to the CheckBoxNow code to turn it into the\\ncode for the CheckBoxLater project are in the MessageReceived() function.\\nHere\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-8. The window that results from running the CheckBoxLater program\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, meaning DON\\'T beep\\n;\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, meaning DO beep\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\n// Here we don\\'t do anything. Instead, we wait until the user\\n// performs some other action before checking the value of the\\n// checkbox break;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIn MessageReceived(), the body of the CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case section\\nperforms no action--a message of this type is now essentially ignored. The program would run the same even if this case section was removed, but I\\'ve left the\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case label in the switch so that it\\'s evident that\\nMessageReceived() is still the recipient of such messages.\\n\\nRadio Buttons\\nA radio button is similar to a checkbox in that it is a two-state control. Unlike a\\ncheckbox, though, a radio button always appears grouped with at least one other\\ncontrol of its kind.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFor any given radio button group, no more than one radio button can be on at\\nany time. When the user clicks on one button in a group, the button that was on\\nat the time of the click is turned off and the newly clicked button is turned on. A\\nradio button group is responsible for updating the state of its buttons--your code\\nwon\\'t need to turn them on and off.\\n\\nCreating a Radio Button\\nThe BRadioButton constructor has the same six parameters described back in this\\nchapter\\'s \"The BControl class\" section:\\nBRadioButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nLike other types of controls, a radio button\\'s height will be adjusted if the height\\nspecified in the frame rectangle isn\\'t enough to accommodate the font being used\\nto display the radio button\\'s label.\\nBefore creating a new radio button, define a constant to be used as the control\\'s\\nmessage type. Here\\'s an example from a project that has two radio buttons in a\\nwindow:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess to a radio button is easiest if a data member of the control type is added to\\nthe class declaration of the window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet shows the creation of two radio buttons, each of which is\\nadded to the same view:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\"One\", new BMessage(RADIO_1_MSG));\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\n\"Two\", new BMessage(RADIO_2_MSG));\\n\\nBy adding radio buttons to the same view, you designate that the buttons be considered a part of a radio button group. The simple act of placing a number of buttons in the same view is enough to have these buttons act in unison. A click on\\none radio button turns that button on, but not until that button turns off all other\\nradio buttons in the same view.\\nA single window can have any number of radio button groups, or sets. For\\ninstance, a window might have one group of three buttons that provides the user\\nwith the option of displaying graphic images in monochrome, grayscale, or color.\\nThis same window could also have a radio button group that provides the user\\nwith a choice of four filters to apply to the image. In such a scenario, the window\\nwould need to include a minimum of two views--one for the group of three\\ncolor-level radio buttons and another for the group of four filter radio buttons.\\n\\nRadio Buttons Example Project\\nThe RadioButtonGroup project demonstrates how to create a group of radio buttons. As shown in Figure 6-9, the RadioButtonGroup program\\'s window includes a\\ngroup of three radio buttons that allow the user to alter the behavior of the Beep\\npush button.\\n\\nFigure 6-9. The window that results from running the RadioButtonGroup program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the radio buttons\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file includes four control message constants--one\\nper control. The push button constant has been given the value \\'bEEp\\' just to\\nillustrate that an application-defined message constant can include uppercase characters (to avoid conflicting with Be-defined control message constants, it just\\nshouldn\\'t consist of all uppercase characters).\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\'bEEp\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nThis project\\'s version of the MyHelloWindow class includes six data members: one\\nto keep track of the window\\'s view, one to keep track of each of the window\\'s\\nfour controls, and one to keep track of the number of beeps to play when the\\npush button is clicked:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLaying out the radio buttons\\nA number of radio buttons are defined as a group when they all reside in the same\\nview. A MyHelloWindow object includes a view (MyDrawView) that occupies its\\nentire content area--so I could add the three radio buttons to this view and have\\nthem automatically become a radio button group. That, however, isn\\'t what I\\'m\\nabout to do. Instead, I\\'ll create a new view and add it to the existing view. If at a\\nlater time I want to add a second group of radio buttons (to control some other,\\nunrelated, option) to the window, the buttons that will comprise that group will\\nneed to be in a new view--otherwise they\\'ll just be absorbed into the existing\\nradio button group. By creating a new view that exists just for one group of radio\\nbuttons, I\\'m getting in the habit of setting up a radio button group as an isolated\\nentity.\\nPlacing a radio button group in its own new view also proves beneficial if it\\nbecomes necessary to make a change to the layout of all of the group\\'s radio buttons. For instance, if I want to relocate all of the buttons in a group to another\\narea of the window, I just redefine the group\\'s view rectangle rather than redefining each of the individual radio button boundary rectangles. When the view\\nmoves, so do the radio buttons in it. Or, consider that I may, for aesthetic reasons, want to outline the area that holds the radio buttons. I can easily do so by\\nframing the radio button group view.\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe following variable declarations appear near the top of the MyHelloWindow.\\ncpp file. Note that the boundary rectangle for each of the three radio buttons has a\\nleft coordinate of 10.0, yet the radio buttons are certainly more than 10 pixels in\\nfrom the left side of the window.\\nKeep in mind that after being created, the radio buttons will be added to a new\\nBView that is positioned in the window based on the radioGroupRect rectangle.\\nThus, the coordinate values of the radio button rectangles are relative to the new\\nBView. Figure 6-10 clarifies my point by showing where the radio group view will\\nbe placed in the window. In that figure, the values 125 and 50 come from the left\\nand top values in the radioGroupRect rectangle declared here:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\n*radioBeep1Label = \"One Beep\";\\n*radioBeep2Label = \"Two Beeps\";\\n*radioBeep3Label = \"Three Beeps\";\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-10. A group of radio buttons can reside in their own view\\n\\nCreating the radio buttons\\nThe three radio buttons are created, as expected, in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, a generic view (a view of the Be class BView) to which the\\nradio buttons will be added is created and added to the view of type MyDrawView.\\nBy default, each new radio button is turned off. A group of radio buttons must\\nalways have one button on, so after the three radio buttons are created, one of\\nthem (arbitrarily, the One Beep button) is turned on by calling the button\\'s\\nSetValue() member function. The data member fNumBeeps is then initialized to\\na value that matches the number of beeps indicated by the turned-on radio button:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBView\\n\\n*radioGroupView;\\n\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\",\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a radio button click\\nWhen a radio button is clicked, a message of the appropriate application-defined\\ntype reaches the window\\'s MessageReceived() function. The clicking of a radio\\nbutton, like the clicking of a checkbox, typically doesn\\'t cause an immediate\\naction to occur. Such is the case in this example. MessageReceived() handles\\nthe button click by simply setting the MyHelloWindow data member fNumBeeps to\\nthe value indicated by the clicked-on radio button. When the user eventually clicks\\non the Beep push button, beep() is invoked the appropriate number of times:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 3;\\nbreak;\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nfor (i = 1; i <= fNumBeeps; i++) {\\nbeep();\\nif (i != fNumBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nView Hierarchy and Controls\\nChapter 4 introduced the concept of the window view hierarchy--the organization of views within a window. In this chapter\\'s most recent example you\\'ve just\\nseen a window that included a number of views (keeping in mind that a control is\\na type of view). Now that you\\'ve encountered the first example that includes several views, this a good time to revisit the topic of the view hierarchy in order to fill\\nin some of the details. Figure 6-11 shows the view hierarchy for a window--an\\nobject of the MyHelloWindow class--from the RadioButtonGroup program.\\nAdding views to the hierarchy\\nA window\\'s top view is always a \"built-in\" part of the window--you don\\'t explicitly add the top view as you add other views. The BView-derived fMyView view\\nlies directly below the top view, telling you that this view has been added to the\\nwindow. The BButton fButtonBeep1 view and the BView radioGroupView lie\\ndirectly below the fMyView view, so you know that each has been added to\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTop View\\n\\nfmyView\\n\\n\\nradioGroupView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-11. The view hierarchy for the RadioButtonGroup window\\n\\nfMyView. Finally, the three BRadioButton views are beneath radioGroupView,\\ntelling you that these three views have been added to radioGroupView. You can\\nconfirm this by looking at the six AddChild() calls in the MyHelloWindow constructor--they indicate which parent view each view was added to:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n...\\n...\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAccessing views\\nThe names of the views in Figure 6-12 tell you how each view is referenced.\\nYou don\\'t draw to the top view--it merely serves as a container for organizing\\nother views. To reference this view (as when adding a view to the window), reference the window itself. In the window\\'s constructor, just call the desired BWindow\\nmember function, as in:\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFrom outside a window member function, use the fMyWindow data member from\\nthe MyHelloApplication object. If the fMyView view was to be added in the\\nBApplication constructor after the window was created, the call to AddChild()\\nwould look like this:\\nfMyWindow->AddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe Be naming convention states that the name of a class data member should\\nstart with a lowercase \"f\" character. In Figure 6-11 you see that five of the six\\nviews below the top view are referenced by data members. To work with any one\\nof these views, use the data member that references it. For instance, to invoke the\\nBView member function FillRect() to fill a rectangle in the window\\'s fMyView\\nview, just call the routine like this:\\nfMyView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nI haven\\'t kept a data member reference in the MyHelloWindow class to the BView\\nthat groups the three radio buttons. If it became necessary to reference this view,\\nyou could call the BView member function FindView() to locate the view object\\nand return a reference to it. Recall that when a view is created, you give it a name.\\nFor example, the radio group view was given the name \"RadioView\":\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n\\nYou can find the view at any time by calling FindView() from the parent view.\\nFor instance, to fill a rectangle in the radio group view, call FindView() from that\\nview\\'s parent view, fMyView:\\nBView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\naView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nKeep in mind that there are always two, and may be three, references, associated with one view. When a view is created, the view\\nobject is returned to the program and referenced by a variable (such\\nas radioGroupView in the preceding example). When invoking the\\nBView (or BView-derived) class constructor, a name for the view is\\nsupplied in quotes (as in \"RadioView\" in the preceding example).\\nFinally, some views have a label--a name that is displayed on the\\nview itself (as in a control such as a BButton--the button displays a\\nname such as OK or Beep).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nView Updating\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, the MyHelloWindow constructor creates a view\\nreferenced by the MyHelloWindow data member fMyView and a view referenced\\nby the local BView variable radioGroupView. This one MyHelloWindow constructor shows two ways of working with views, so it will be worth our while to again\\nsidetrack from the discussion of controls in order to gain a better understanding of\\nthe very important topic of views.\\nBView-derived classes and the generic BView class\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, and several projects preceding it, I\\'ve opted to\\nfill the content area of a window with a view of the application-defined BViewderived class MyDrawView. One of the chief reasons for defining such a class is to\\nlet the system become responsible for updating a view. This is accomplished by\\nhaving my own class override the BView member function Draw().\\nA second way to work with a view is to not define a view class, but instead simply create a generic BView object within an application-derived routine. That\\'s\\nwhat the RadioButtonGroup project does in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\n\\nAfter you attach the new view to an existing view, drawing can take place in the\\nnew view. For instance, if in addition to beeping, you want the program to draw a\\nborder around the three radio buttons in response to a click on the window\\'s one\\npush button, add the following code under the BUTTON_BEEP_MSG case label in\\nthe MessageReceived() function:\\nBView\\nBRect\\n\\n*radioView;\\nradioFrame;\\n\\nradioView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\nradioFrame = radioView->Bounds();\\nradioView->StrokeRect(radioFrame);\\n\\nSuperficially, this approach of creating a generic BView and then drawing in it is\\nsimpler than defining a BView-derived class and then implementing a Draw()\\nfunction for that class. But in taking this easier approach, you lose the benefit of\\nhaving the system take responsibility for updating the view. Consider the above\\nsnippet. That code will nicely frame the three radio buttons. But if the window\\nthat holds the buttons ever needs updating (and if the user is allowed to move the\\nwindow, of course at some point it will), the frame that surrounds the buttons\\nwon\\'t be redrawn. The system will indeed invoke a Draw() function for\\nradioGroupView, but it will be the empty BView version of Draw().\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nImplementing a BView-derived class in the RadioButtonGroup project\\nWhat if I do want my RadioButtonGroup program to frame the radio buttons, and\\nto do so in a way that automatically updates the frame as needed? Instead of placing the radio buttons in a generic BView object, I can define a new BView-derived\\nclass just for this purpose:\\nclass MyRadioView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyRadioView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyRadioView constructor can be empty--just as the MyDrawView constructor\\nis:\\nMyRadioView::MyRadioView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyRadioView version of the Draw() function is quite simple as well:\\nvoid MyRadioView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nWhile I could keep track of an instance of the MyRadioView class by calling the\\nparent view\\'s FindView() function as needed, I\\'d opt for the method of storing a\\nreference to the view in the window that will hold the view. Here I\\'ve added such\\na reference to the six existing data members in the MyHelloWindow class of the\\nRadioButtonGroup project:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nMyRadioView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n*fMyRadioView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create a MyRadioView object, I replace the generic BView creation code in the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor with the following:\\nfMyRadioView = new MyRadioView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\");\\nfMyView->AddChild(fMyRadioView);\\n\\nNow, when a radio button is created, I add it to the MyRadioView object\\nfMyRadioView, like this:\\n\\nThanks to the Draw() function of the MyRadioView class, the new radio button\\ngroup will have a border drawn around it, exactly as was shown back in\\nFigure 6-10. Better yet, obscuring the window and then bringing it back to the\\nforefront doesn\\'t cause the border to disappear--the update message that the\\nApplication Server sends to the MyHelloWindow window results in the calling of\\nthe Draw() function of each \"out-of-date\" view in the window.\\nIf you want to see all of the code for this new version of the RadioButtonGroup\\nprogram, you\\'ll find it in the RadioButtonGroupFrame project.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve followed this discussion, you should be able to quickly\\nanswer the following question: in the original RadioButtonGroup\\nproject, why didn\\'t I create a new BView-derived class like the\\nMyRadioView class and use an object of that type to hold the radio\\nbuttons? Answer: because I use the radio button view only as a\\nmeans to group the radio buttons together--I don\\'t draw to the\\nview. The simple approach of creating a BView on the fly works for\\nthat purpose.\\n\\nText Fields\\nThe BTextControl class is used to add a text field to a window. A text field consists of both a static, uneditable label and an editable field that allows the user to\\nenter a single line of text. The label appears to the left of the editable field, and is\\ngenerally used to provide the user with an idea of what to enter in the editable\\nfield (\"Enter your age in years:\" is an example).\\nA text field is often handled like a checkbox or radio button: no immediate action\\nis taken by the program in response to the user\\'s action. Typically, the program\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nacquires the text in the text field only when a button labeled OK, Accept, Save, or\\nsomething similar is clicked on.\\nIf your program needs to get or set the editable text of a text field as soon as the\\nuser has finished typing, the BTextControl accommodates you. Like other controls, a text field issues a message that will be received by the\\nMessageReceived() function of the control\\'s window. Such a message is sent\\nwhen the control determines that the user has finished entering text in the editable field, as indicated by a press of the Enter, Return, or Tab key or a mouse button click in the editable field of a different text field control. In all of these\\ninstances, the text that was previously in the editable field must have been modified in order for the control to send the message. If the user, say, clicks in an editable field of a text field, then presses the Enter key, no message will be sent.\\n\\nCreating a Text Field\\nThe BTextControl constructor has six parameters common to all controls, along\\nwith a text parameter that specifies a string that is to initially appear in the editable field of the text field control:\\nBTextControl(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*text,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nPassing a string in the text parameter of the BTextControl constructor is useful\\nif you want to alert the user that a default string or value is to be used in the event\\nthat the user doesn\\'t enter a string or value. If a value of NULL is passed as the\\ntext parameter, no text initially appears in the editable field.\\nAs with all control types, you must define a unique message constant that will be\\npaired with the control. To assist in keeping track of the text field control, you can\\noptionally include a data member in the window class in which the control is to\\nreside:\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_FIELD_MSG\\n\\n\\'txtf\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBTextControl *fTextField;\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create the control, pass the BTextControl constructor a boundary rectangle,\\nname, static text label, initial editable text, and a new BMessage object. Then add\\nthe new text field to the view the control will reside in:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Number of dependents:\", \"0\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nGetting and Setting the Text\\nAfter creating a text field control, your program can obtain or set the editable field\\ntext at any time. To obtain the text currently in the text field, invoke the\\nBTextControl member function Text(). Here, the text in a control is returned to\\nthe program and saved to a string named textFieldText:\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n\\nThe text that appears in the editable field of the control is initially set in the\\nBTextControl constructor, and is then edited by the user. The contents of the\\neditable field can also be set at any time by your program by invoking the\\nBTextControl member function SetText(). This routine overwrites the current\\ncontents of the editable field with the string that was passed to SetText(). Here\\nthe current contents of a control\\'s editable field are obtained and checked for\\nvalidity. If the user-entered string isn\\'t consistent with what\\'s expected, the string\\n\"Invalid Entry\" is written in place of the incorrect text the user entered:\\nchar\\nbool\\n\\n*textFieldText;\\ntextValid;\\n\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n...\\n// check for validity of user-entered text that\\'s now held in textFieldText\\n...\\nif (!textValid)\\nfTextField->SetText(\"Invalid Entry\");\\n\\nReproportioning the Static Text and Editable\\nText Areas\\nThe label parameter specifies the static text that is to appear to the left of the\\neditable field. If NULL is passed here, all of the control\\'s boundary rectangle (as\\ndefined by the frame parameter) is devoted to the text field. Any label string\\nother than NULL tells the constructor to devote half the width of the frame\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nrectangle to the static text label and the other half of this rectangle to the editable\\ntext area. Consider this snippet:\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Name:\", \"George Washington Carver\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nIn this code, a text field control with a width of 200 pixels is created. By default,\\nthe static text field and the editable text field of the control each have a width that\\nis one-half of the control\\'s boundary rectangle, or 100 pixels. The result is shown\\nin the top window in Figure 6-12. Because the label is a short string, and because\\nthe value that might be entered in the editable text field may be a long string, it\\nwould make sense and be more aesthetically pleasing to change the proportions\\nof the two text areas. Instead of devoting 100 pixels to the static text label\\n\"Name:\", it would be better to give that text just, say, 35 pixels of the 200 pixels\\nthat make up the control\\'s width. Such reproportioning is possible using the\\nBTextControl member function SetDivider().\\n\\nFigure 6-12. The two areas of a text field control can be proportioned in different ways\\n\\nWhen passed a floating-point value, SetDivider() re-establishes the dividing\\npoint between the two text areas of a text field control. SetDivider() uses the\\nBTextControl object\\'s local coordinate system (meaning that the left edge of the\\ntext edit control has a value of 0.0, regardless of where the control is positioned in\\na window). The following addition to the above snippet changes the ratio to 35\\npixels for the static text field and 165 pixels for the editable text field. The bottom\\nwindow in Figure 6-12 shows the result. Notice that the placement and overall\\nwidth of the control are unaffected by the call to SetDivider().\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nfloat\\n\\nxCoordinate = 35.0;\\n\\nfTextField->SetDivider(xCoordinate);\\n\\nText Field Example Project\\nThe TextField project demonstrates how to include a text field in a window, obtain\\nthat control\\'s user-entered string, and make use of that string elsewhere. When the\\nuser clicks the window\\'s button, the program gets the string from the text field and\\nuses that string as the new label for the push button. Figure 6-13 shows the program\\'s window after the button has been clicked.\\n\\nFigure 6-13. The window that results from running the TextField program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the text field\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file is edited to include a control message constant\\nfor the window\\'s two controls.\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG\\n\\n\\'newT\\'\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s views, the MyHelloWindow class now holds three\\ndata members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBTextControl\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNewTitle;\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nCreating the text field\\nThe text field and button information are defined together just before the implementation of the MyHelloWindow constructor. The push button label will initially\\nbe \"Beep One\" and the text that will appear initially in the editable field of the text\\nfield control is the string \"Beep Me!\":\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*textNewTitleName = \"TextTitle\";\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*textNewTitleLabel = \"Enter New Button Name:\";\\n*textNewTitleText = \"Beep Me!\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates the window\\'s main view, then creates\\nand adds the button control and text field control to that view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfTextNewTitle = new BTextControl(textNewTitleRect, textNewTitleName,\\ntextNewTitleLabel, textNewTitleText,\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextNewTitle);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a text field entry and a button click\\nA program can make use of a text field control in two ways. First, a window can\\nobtain the user-entered text from a text field control at any time--without regard\\nfor whether the text field has issued a message. Second, a window can await a\\nmessage sent by the text field and then respond. The MessageReceived() function demonstrates both these options.\\nWhen the window\\'s push button is clicked, the window receives a message from\\nthe button. At that time, the editable text of the text field control is retrieved and\\nused in a call to the button\\'s SetLabel() function. While the retrieving of the text\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nfield control\\'s editable text takes place in response to a message, that message is\\none issued by the push button--not the text field control.\\nWhen the user clicks in the text field, that control becomes the focus view. Recall\\nfrom Chapter 4 that a window can have only one focus view, and that view\\nbecomes the recipient of keystrokes. Once a text field is the focus view (as indicated by the editable text field being highlighted and the I-beam appearing in it),\\nand once that control\\'s editable text has been altered in any way, the control is\\ncapable of sending a message. That happens when the user presses the Return,\\nEnter, or Tab key. In response to a message sent by the text field control,\\nMessageReceived() resets the push button\\'s label to its initial title of \"Beep One\"\\n(as defined by the buttonBeep1Label constant):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNewTitle->Text();\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMultiple Control Example Project\\nThe numerous example projects in this chapter demonstrated how to incorporate\\none, or perhaps two, types of controls in a window. Your real-world program\\nmight very well include numerous controls. ControlDemo is such a program--its\\none window holds the six controls shown in Figure 6-14.\\nTo use ControlDemo, enter a number in the range of 1 to 9 in the text field control, click a radio button control to choose one of three drawing colors, then click\\nthe Draw button. The ControlDemo program responds by drawing colored, overlapping circles. The number of circles drawn is determined by the value entered in\\nthe text field. Before drawing the circles, ControlDemo erases the drawing area--\\nso you can try as many combinations of circles and colors as you want. You can\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-14. The window that results from running the ControlDemo program\\n\\nalso click the Disable colors checkbox to disable the radio buttons and force drawing to take place in the last selected color.\\n\\nPreparing the Window Class for the Controls\\nThe program\\'s window holds six controls, so you can expect to see six application-defined message constants in the MyHelloWindow.h file:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_DRAW_MSG\\nRADIO_RED_MSG\\nRADIO_GREEN_MSG\\nRADIO_BLACK_MSG\\nTEXT_NUM_CIRCLES_MSG\\nCHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG\\n\\n\\'draw\\'\\n\\'rred\\'\\n\\'rgrn\\'\\n\\'rblk\\'\\n\\'crcl\\'\\n\\'setc\\'\\n\\nEach control is kept track of by a data member in the MyHelloWindow class.\\nThere\\'s also the familiar data member that exists to keep track of the window\\'s\\nmain view:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBTextControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBButton\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNumCircles;\\n*fCheckBoxSetColor;\\n*fRadioRed;\\n*fRadioGreen;\\n*fRadioBlack;\\n*fButtonDraw;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nCreating the Controls\\nAll of the variables that are to be used as arguments to the control constructors are\\ndeclared together in MyHelloWindow.cpp. Each of the controls is then created in\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor. There are no surprises here--just use new with\\nthe appropriate control constructor and assign the resulting object to the proper\\nMyHelloWindow data member.\\nYou should be quite familiar with this process by now. To see the complete\\nMyHelloWindow constructor listing, refer to MyHelloWindow.cpp.\\n\\nHandling the Messages\\nAll application-defined control messages are handled in the body of the switch\\nstatement in MessageReceived(). The checkbox message is handled by first\\nchecking the control\\'s value, then disabling or enabling the three radio buttons as\\nappropriate:\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetColor->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON) {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(false);\\n}\\nelse {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(true);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nEach of the radio buttons does nothing more than set the high color to an RGB\\ncolor that matches the button\\'s label:\\ncase RADIO_RED_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_GREEN_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_BLACK_MSG:\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nClicking the Draw button results in a number of colored circles being drawn. Here\\nthe text field value is obtained to see how many circles to draw, and the high\\ncolor is used in the drawing of those circles. Before drawing the circles, any old\\ndrawing is erased by whiting out an area of the window that is at least as big as\\nthe drawing area:\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nnumCircles;\\ni;\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst char *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNumCircles->Text();\\nnumCircles = (int32)textFieldText[0] - 48;\\nif ((numCircles < 1) || (numCircles > 9))\\nnumCircles = 5;\\nfMyView->FillRect(areaRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfor (i=1; i<=numCircles; i++) {\\nfMyView->StrokeEllipse(circleRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe text field message is completely ignored. The program obtains the editable\\ntext when the user clicks the Draw button. As written, the program checks the text\\nfield input to see if the user entered a numeric character in the range of 1 to 9. If\\nany other value (or character or string) has been entered, the program arbitrarily\\nsets the number of circles to draw to five. This is a less-than-perfect way of doing\\nthings in that it allows the user to enter an invalid value. One way to improve the\\nprogram would be to have the program react to a text field control message. That\\ntype of message is delivered to MessageReceived() when the user ends a typing session (that is, when the user clicks elsewhere, or presses the Enter, Return,\\nor Tab key). MessageReceived() could then check the user-entered value and, if\\ninvalid, set the editable text area to a valid value (and, perhaps, post a window\\nthat informs the user what has taken place).\\n\\nModifying the ControlDemo Project\\nWhat the program draws isn\\'t important to the demonstration of how to include a\\nnumber of controls in a window. With the graphics information found in Chapter 4\\nyou should be able to modify ControlDemo so that it draws something far more\\ninteresting. Begin by enlarging the window so that you have some working room.\\nIn the MyHelloWorld.cpp file, change the size of the BRect passed to the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nMyHelloWindow constructor. Here I\\'m setting the window to have a width of 500\\npixels and a height of 300 pixels:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nLimiting drawing to only three colors isn\\'t a very user-friendly thing to do, so your\\nnext change might be to include a BColorControl object that lets the user\\nchoose any of the 256 system colors. The details of working with a color control\\nwere covered back in Chapter 5. Recall that you can easily support this type of\\ncontrol by first adding a BColorControl data member to the MyHelloWindow\\nclass:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nBColorControl\\n*fColorControl;\\n};\\n\\nThen, in the MyHelloWindow constructor, create the control and add it to the window. You\\'ll need to determine the appropriate coordinates for the BPoint and a\\nsuitable Be-defined constant for the color_control_layout in order to position\\nthe color control in the window you\\'re designing:\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_4x64;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n\\nFinally, when it comes time to draw, check to see which color the user has\\nselected from the color control. You can do that when the user clicks the Draw\\nbutton:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n// now load up this section with plenty of graphics-drawing code\\nbreak;\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nNow, review Chapter 4 to come up some ideas for drawing some really interesting graphics. Then add them under the BUTTON_DRAW_MSG case label in\\nMessageReceived()!\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Introduction to\\nControls\\n Buttons\\n Picture Buttons\\n Checkboxes\\n Radio Buttons\\n Text Fields\\n Multiple Control\\nExample Project\\n\\n6.\\n\\nControls and\\nMessages\\n\\nA control is a graphic image that resides in a window and acts as a device that\\naccepts user input. The BeOS API includes a set of classes that make it easy to add\\ncertain predefined controls to a program. These standard controls include the button, checkbox, radio button, text field, and color control. There\\'s also a Be-defined\\nclass that allows you to turn any picture into a control. That allows you to create\\ncontrols that have the look of real-world devices such as switches and dials.\\nChapter 5, Drawing, described the color control and the BColorControl class\\nused to create such controls. This chapter discusses other control types and the\\nclasses used to create each. Also discussed is the BControl class, the class from\\nwhich all other control classes are derived.\\nWhen the user clicks on a control, the system responds by sending a message to\\nthe window that holds the control. This message indicates exactly which control\\nhas been clicked. The message is received by the window\\'s MessageReceived()\\nhook function, where it is handled. Since the BWindow version of\\nMessageReceived() won\\'t know how to go about responding to messages that\\noriginate from your controls, you\\'ll override this routine. Your application then\\ngains control of how such messages are handled, and can include any code necessary to carry out the task you want the control to perform. This chapter includes\\nexamples that demonstrate how to create controls and how to override\\nMessageReceived() such that the function handles mouse clicks on controls of\\nany of the standard types.\\n\\nIntroduction to Controls\\nWhen a BWindow object receives a message, it either handles the message itself or\\nlets one of its views handle it. To handle a message, the window invokes a\\nBWindow hook function. For example, a B_ZOOM message delivered to a window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nresults in that window invoking the BWindow hook function Zoom() to shrink or\\nenlarge the window. To allocate the handling of a message to one of its views, the\\nwindow passes the message to the affected view, and the view then invokes the\\nappropriate BView hook function. For example, a B_MOUSE_DOWN message results\\nin the affected view invoking the BView hook function MouseDown().\\nBesides being the recipient of system messages, a window is also capable of\\nreceiving application-defined messages. This lets you implement controls in your\\napplication\\'s windows. When you create a control (such as a button object from\\nthe BButton class), define a unique message type that becomes associated with\\nthat one control. Also, add the control to a window. When the user operates the\\ncontrol (typically by clicking on it, as for a button), the system passes the application-defined message to the window. How the window handles the message is\\ndetermined by the code you include in the BWindow member function\\nMessageReceived().\\n\\nControl Types\\nYou can include a number of different types of controls in your windows. Each\\ncontrol is created from a class derived from the abstract class BControl. The\\nBControl class provides the basic features common to all controls, and the\\nBControl-derived classes add capabilities unique to each control type. In this\\nchapter, you\\'ll read about the following control types:\\nButton\\nThe BButton class is used to create a standard button, sometimes referred to\\nas a push button. Clicking on a button results in some immediate action taking place.\\nPicture button\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a button that can have any size,\\nshape, and look to it. While picture buttons can have an infinite variety of\\nlooks, they act in the same manner as a push button--a mouse click results in\\nan action taking place.\\nCheckbox\\nThe BCheckBox class creates a checkbox. A checkbox has two states: on and\\noff. Clicking a checkbox always toggles the control to its opposite state or\\nvalue. Clicking on a checkbox usually doesn\\'t immediately impact the program. Instead, a program typically waits until some other action takes place\\n(such as the click of a certain push button) before gathering the current state\\nof the checkbox. At that time, some program setting or feature is adjusted\\nbased on the value in the checkbox.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nRadio button\\nThe BRadioButton class is used to create a radio button. Like a checkbox, a\\nradio button has two states: on and off. Unlike a checkbox, a radio button is\\nnever found alone. Radio buttons are grouped together in a set that is used to\\ncontrol an option or feature of a program. Clicking on a radio button turns off\\nwhatever radio button was on at the time of the mouse click, and turns on the\\nnewly clicked radio button. Use a checkbox in a yes or no or true or false situation. Use radio buttons for a condition that offers multiple choices that are\\nmutually exclusive (since only one button can be on at any given time).\\nText field\\nThe BTextControl class is used to create a text field. A text field is a control\\nconsisting of a static string on the left and an editable text area on the right.\\nThe static text acts as a label that provides the user with information about\\nwhat is to be typed in the editable text area of the control. Typing text in the\\neditable text area of a control can have an immediate effect on the program,\\nbut it\\'s more common practice to wait until some other action takes place (like\\na click on a push button) before the program reads the user-entered text.\\nColor control\\nThe BColorControl class, shown in Chapter 5, creates color controls. A color\\ncontrol displays the 256 system colors, each in a small square. The user can\\nchoose a color by clicking on it. A program can, at any time, check to see\\nwhich color the user has currently selected, and perform some action based\\non that choice. Often the selected color is used in the next, or all subsequent,\\ndrawing operation the program performs.\\nFigure 6-1 shows four of the six types of controls available to you. In the upper\\nleft of the figure is a button. The control in the upper right is a text field. The\\nlower left of the figure shows a checkbox in both its on and off states, while the\\nlower right of the figure shows a radio button in both its states. A picture button\\ncan have any size and look you want, so it\\'s not shown. All the buttons are associated with labels that appear on or next to the controls themselves.\\nThe sixth control type, the color control based on the BColorControl class, isn\\'t\\nshown either--it was described in detail in Chapter 5 and will only be mentioned\\nin passing in this chapter.\\nA control can be in an enabled statewhere the user can interact with itor a\\ndisabled state. A disabled control will appear dim, and clicking on the control will\\nhave no effect. Figure 6-2 shows a button control in both its enabled state (leftmost in the figure) and its disabled state (rightmost in the figure). Also shown is\\nwhat an enabled button looks like when it is selected using the Tab key (middle\\nin the figure). A user can press the Tab key to cycle through controls, making each\\none in turn the current control. As shown in Figure 6-2, a button\\'s label will be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFigure 6-1. Examples of button, text field, checkbox, and radio button controls\\n\\nunderlined when it\\'s current. Once current, other key presses (typically the Return\\nand Enter key) affect that control.\\n\\nFigure 6-2. A button control that\\'s (from left to right) enabled, current, and disabled\\n\\nCreating a Control\\nA control is created from one of six Interface Kit classes--each of which is covered in detail in this chapter. Let us start by examining the BControl class from\\nwhich they are derived.\\nThe BControl class\\nThe BControl class is an abstract class derived from the BView and BInvoker\\nclasses. Control objects are created from BControl-derived classes, so all controls\\nare types of views.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to create controls that aren\\'t based on the BControl\\nclass. In fact, the Be API does that for the BListView and\\nBMenuItem classes. These are exceptions, though. You\\'ll do best by\\nbasing each of your application\\'s controls on one of the six\\nBControl-derived classes. Doing so means your controls will\\nbehave as expected by the user.\\n\\nBControl is an abstract class, so your project will create BControl-derived class\\nobjects rather than BControl objects. However, because the constructor of each\\nBControl-derived class invokes the BControl constructor, a study of the\\nBControl constructor is a worthwhile endeavor. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nBControl(BRect\\nconst char\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nFour of the six BControl constructor parameters match BView constructor parameters. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags arguments get passed to the\\nBView constructor by the BControl constructor. These parameters are discussed\\nin Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so here I\\'ll offer only a brief recap of\\ntheir purposes. The frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of\\nthe view. The name parameter establishes a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The resizingMode parameter is a mask that defines the behavior of the view should the size of the view\\'s parent view change. The flags\\nparameter is a mask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of notifications (such as update) the view is to be aware of.\\nThe remaining two BControl constructor parameters are specific to the control.\\nThe label parameter is a string that defines the text associated with it. For\\ninstance, for a button control, the label holds the words that appear on the button. The message parameter is a BMessage object that provides a means for the\\nsystem to recognize the control as a unique entity. When the control is selected by\\nthe user, it is this message that the system will send to the window that holds the\\ncontrol.\\nYour project won\\'t create BControl objects, so a sample call to the BControl\\nconstructor isn\\'t useful here. Instead, let\\'s look at the simplest type of BControlderived object: the BButton.\\nThe BButton class\\nCreating a new push button involves creating a new BButton object. The\\nBButton constructor parameters are an exact match of those used by the\\nBControl constructor:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor invokes the BControl constructor, passing all of its\\narguments to that routine. The BControl constructor uses the label argument to\\ninitialize the button\\'s label, and uses the message argument to assign a unique\\nmessage to the button. The BControl constructor then invokes the BView constructor, passing along the remaining four arguments it received from the BButton\\nconstructor. The BView constructor then sets up the button as a view. After the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nBControl and BView constructors have executed, the BButton constructor carries on with its creation of a button object by implementing button-specific tasks.\\nThis is, in essence, how the constructor for each of the BControl-derived classes\\nworks.\\nCreating a button\\nA button is created by defining the arguments that are passed to the BButton constructor and then invoking that constructor using new. To become functional, the\\nbutton must then be added to a window. That\\'s what\\'s taking place in this snippet:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nconst char* buttonName = \"OKButton\";\\nconst char* buttonLabel = \"OK\";\\nBButton\\n*buttonOK;\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonOK);\\n\\nIn the above code, the BRect variable buttonRect defines the size and location\\nof the button. This push button will be 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels high. The\\nbuttonName string gives the button the name \"OKButton.\" This is the name used\\nto locate and access the button by view name using the BView member function\\nFindView(). The name that actually appears on the button itself, \"OK,\" is defined\\nby the buttonLabel string. The message associated with the new button control\\nis a new BMessage object of type BUTTON_OK_MSG. I\\'ll explain the BMessage class\\nin a minute. Here it suffices to say that, as shown above, creating a new message\\ncan be as easy as defining a four-character string and passing this constant to the\\nBMessage constructor.\\nThe BButton constructor prototype lists six parameters, yet the above invocation\\nof that constructor passes only four arguments. The fifth and sixth parameters,\\nresizingMode and flags, offer default values that are used when these arguments are omitted. The default resizingMode value (B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP) creates a button that will remain a fixed distance from the left and\\ntop edges of the control\\'s parent view should the parent view be resized. The\\ndefault flags value (B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE) specifies that the control\\nneeds to be redrawn if altered, and that it can become the focus view in response\\nto keyboard actions.\\nAdding a control to a window means adding the control to a view. In the above\\nsnippet, it\\'s assumed that a view (perhaps an object of the application-defined\\nBView-derived MyDrawView class) has already been created.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nEnabling and disabling a control\\nWhen a control is created, it is initially enabled--the user can click on the control\\nto select it. If you want a control to be disabled, invoke the control\\'s\\nSetEnabled() member function. The following line of code disables the\\nbuttonOK button control that was created in the previous snippet:\\nbuttonOK->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nSetEnabled() can be invoked on a control at any time, but if the control is to\\nstart out disabled, call SetEnabled() before displaying the window the control\\nappears in. To again enable a control, call SetEnabled() with an argument of\\ntrue.\\nThis chapter\\'s CheckBoxNow project demonstrates the enabling and disabling of a\\nbutton. The technique in that example can be used on any type of control.\\nTurning a control on and off\\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are two-state controls--they can be on or off.\\nWhen a control of either of these two types is created, it is initially off. If you want\\nthe control on (to check a checkbox or fill in a radio button), invoke the\\nBControl member function SetValue(). Passing SetValue() the Be-defined\\nconstant B_CONTROL_ON sets the control to on. Turning a control on and off in\\nresponse to a user action in the control is the responsibility of the system--not\\nyour program. So after creating a control and setting it to the state you want, you\\nwill seldom need to call SetValue(). If you want your program to \"manually\"\\nturn a control off (as opposed to doing so in response to a user action), have the\\ncontrol invoke its SetValue() function with an argument of B_CONTROL_OFF.\\nA button is a one-state device, so turning a button on or off doesn\\'t make sense.\\nInstead, this snippet turns on a two-state control--a checkbox:\\nrequirePasswordCheckBox->SetValue(B_CONTROL_ON)\\n\\nCreating checkboxes hasn\\'t been covered yet, so you\\'ll want to look at the CheckBox example project later in this chapter to see the complete code for creating and\\nturning on a checkbox.\\n\\nTechnically, a button is also a two-state control. When it is not being\\nclicked, it\\'s off. When the control is being clicked (and before the\\nuser releases the mouse button), it\\'s on. This point is merely an\\naside, though, as it\\'s unlikely that your program will ever need to\\ncheck the state of a button in the way it will check the state of a\\ncheckbox or radio button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo check the current state of a control, invoke the BControl member function\\nValue(). This routine returns an int32 value that is either B_CONTROL_ON (which\\nis defined to be 1) or B_CONTROL_OFF (which is defined to be 0). This snippet\\nobtains the current state of a checkbox, then compares the value of the state to the\\nBe-defined constant B_CONTROL_ON:\\n\\ncontrolState;\\n\\ncontrolState = requirePasswordCheckBox->Value();\\nif (controlState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// password required, display password text field\\n\\nChanging a control\\'s label\\nBoth checkboxes and radio buttons have a label that appears to the right of the\\ncontrol. A text field has a label to the left of the control. The control\\'s label is set\\nwhen the control is created, but it can be changed on the fly.\\nThe BControl member function SetLabel() accepts a single argument: the text\\nthat is to be used in place of the control\\'s existing label. In this next snippet, a\\nbutton\\'s label is initially set to read \"Click,\" but is changed to the string \"Click\\nAgain\" at some point in the program\\'s execution:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonName = \"ClickButton\";\\n*buttonLabel = \"Click\";\\n*buttonClick;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_CLICK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonClick);\\n...\\n...\\nbuttonClick->SetLabel(\"Click Again\");\\n\\nThe labels of other types of controls are changed in the same manner. The last\\nexample project in this chapter, the TextField project, sets the label of a button to\\na string entered by the user.\\n\\nHandling a Control\\nBControl-derived classes take care of some of the work of handling a control. For\\ninstance, in order to properly update a control in response to a mouse button\\nclick, your program doesn\\'t have to keep track of the control\\'s current state, and it\\ndoesn\\'t have to include any code to set the control to the proper state (such as\\ndrawing or erasing the check mark in a checkbox). What action your program\\ntakes in response to a mouse button click is, however, your program\\'s responsibility. When the user clicks on a control, a message will be delivered to the affected\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nwindow. That message will be your program\\'s prompt to perform whatever action\\nis appropriate.\\nMessages and the BMessage class\\nWhen the Application Server delivers a system message to an application\\nwindow, that message arrives in the form of a BMessage object. Your code determines how to handle a system message simply by overriding a BView hook function (such as MouseDown()). Because the routing of a message from the Application Server to a window and then possibly to a view\\'s hook function is\\nautomatically handled for you, the fact that the message is a BMessage object may\\nnot have been important (or even known) to you. A control also makes use of a\\nBMessage object. However, in the case of a control, you need to know a little bit\\nabout working with BMessage objects.\\nThe BMessage class defines a message object as a container that holds information. Referring to the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book, you\\'ll find that this information consists of a name, some number of\\nbytes of data, and a type code. You\\'ll be pleased to find out that when using a\\nBMessage in conjunction with a control, a thorough knowledge of these details of\\nthe BMessage class isn\\'t generally necessary (complex applications aside). Instead,\\nall you need to know of this class is how to create a BMessage object. The snippet a few pages back that created a BButton object illustrated how that\\'s done:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\n// variable declarations here\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nThe only information you need to create a BMessage object is a four-character literal, as in the above definition of BUTTON_OK_MSG as `btmg\\'. This value, which\\nwill serve as the what field of the message, is actually a uint32. So you can\\ndefine the constant as an unsigned 32-bit integer, though most programmers find it\\neasier to remember a literal than the unsigned numeric equivalent. This value then\\nbecomes the argument to the BMessage constructor in the BButton constructor.\\nThis newly created message object won\\'t hold any other information.\\nThe BMessage class defines a single public data member named what. The what\\ndata member holds the four-character string that distinguishes the message from all\\nother message types--including system messages--the application will use. In the\\nprevious snippet, the constant btmg becomes the what data member of the\\nBMessage object created when invoking the BButton constructor.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nWhen the program refers to a system message by its Be-defined constant, such as\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED or B_KEY_DOWN, what\\'s really of interest is the what data\\nmember of the system message. The value of each Be-defined message constant is\\na four-character string composed of a combination of only uppercase characters\\nand, optionally, one or more underscore characters. Here\\'s how Be defines a few\\nof the system message constants:\\nenum {\\nB_ABOUT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n...\\n...\\n};\\n\\n= \\'_ABR\\',\\n\\n= \\'_QRQ\\',\\n\\n= \\'_MDN\\',\\n\\nBe intentionally uses the message constant value convention of uppercase-only\\ncharacters and underscores to make it obvious that a message is a system message. You can easily avoid duplicating a Be-defined message constant by simply\\nincluding one or more lowercase characters in the literal of your own applicationdefined message constants. And to make it obvious that a message isn\\'t a Bedefined one, don\\'t start the message constant name with \"B_\". In this book\\'s\\nexamples, I have chosen to use a fairly informative convention in choosing symbols for application-defined control messages: start with the control type, include a\\nword or words descriptive of what action the control results in, and end with\\n\"MSG\" for \"message.\" The value of each constant may hint at the message type\\n(for instance, `plSD\\' for \"play sound\"), but aside from avoiding all uppercase characters, the value is somewhat arbitrary. These two examples illustrate the convention I use:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_PLAY_SOUND_MSG\\nCALCULATE_VALUES\\n\\n\\'plSD\\'\\n\\'calc\\'\\n\\nMessages and the MessageReceived() member function\\nThe BWindow class is derived from the BLooper class, so a window is a type of\\nlooper--an object that runs a message loop that receives messages from the Application Server. The BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, so a window is also a handler--an object that can handle messages that are dispatched\\nfrom a message loop. A window can both receive messages and handle them.\\nFor the most part, system messages are handled automatically; for instance, when\\na B_ZOOM message is received, the operating system zooms the window. But you\\ncannot completely entrust the handling of an application-defined message to the\\nsystem.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nWhen a user selects a control, the Application Server delivers a message object\\nwith the appropriate what data member value to the affected BWindow object.\\nYou\\'ve just seen a snippet that created a BButton associated with a BMessage\\nobject. That BMessage had a what data member of `btmg\\'. If the user clicked on\\nthe button that results from this object, the Application Server would deliver such\\na message to the affected BWindow. It\\'s up to the window to include code that\\nwatches for, and responds to, this type of message. The BWindow class member\\nfunction MessageReceived() is used for this purpose.\\nWhen an application-defined message reaches a window, it looks for a\\nMessageReceived() function. This routine receives the message, examines the\\nmessage\\'s what data member, and responds depending on its value. The\\nBHandler class defines such a MessageReceived() function. The BHandlerderived class BWindow inherits this function and overrides it. The BWindow version includes a call to the base class BHandler version, thus augmenting what\\nBHandler offers. If the BWindow version of MessageReceived() can\\'t handle a\\nmessage, it passes it up to the BHandler version of this routine. Figure 6-3 shows\\nhow a message that can\\'t be handled by one version of MessageReceived() gets\\npassed up to the next version of this function.\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBHandler\\nversion\\nmessage\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow\\nversion\\nmessage\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nmessage\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow-derived\\nversion\\n\\nFigure 6-3. Message passed to parent class\\'s version of MessageReceived()\\n\\nHere is how the MessageReceived() looks in BWindow:\\nvoid BWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle B_KEY_DOWN and scripting-related system messages\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\ndefault:\\nBHandler::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nYour project\\'s windows won\\'t be based directly on the BWindow class. Instead,\\nwindows will be objects of a class you derive from BWindow. While such a\\nBWindow-derived class will inherit the BWindow version of MessageReceived(),\\nthat version of the function won\\'t suffice--it won\\'t know anything about the application-defined messages you\\'ve paired with the window\\'s controls. Your BWindowderived class should thus do what the BWindow class does: override the inherited\\nversion of MessageReceived() and, within the new implementation of this function, invoke the inherited version:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle application-defined messages\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhat messages your BWindow-derived class version of MessageReceived() looks\\nfor depends on the controls you\\'re adding to windows of that class type. If I add a\\nsingle button to windows of the MyHelloWindow class, and the button\\'s BButton\\nconstructor pairs a message object with a what constant of BUTTON_OK_MSG (as\\nshown in previous snippets), the MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived()\\nwould look like this:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\n// handle a click on the OK button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe particular code that appears under the control\\'s case label depends entirely\\non what action you want to occur in response to the control being clicked. For\\nsimplicity, assume that we want a click on the OK button to do nothing more than\\nsound a beep. The completed version of MessageReceived() looks like this:\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nButtons\\nThe BButton class is used to create a button--a labeled push button that is operated when the button is clicked. The previous sections used the BButton class\\nand button objects for its specific examples and in its code snippets. That section\\nprovided some background on creating and working with buttons, so the emphasis here will be on incorporating the button-related code in a project.\\n\\nCreating a Button\\nThe BButton constructor has six parameters, each of which was described in the\\n\"The BButton class\" section of this chapter:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor calls the BControl constructor, which in turn calls the\\nBView constructor. Together, these routines set up and initialize a BButton object.\\nAfter attaching the button to a window, the height of the button may automatically be adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the button\\'s label and\\nthe border of the button. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates result in\\na button that isn\\'t high enough, the BButton constructor will increase the button\\nheight by increasing the value of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact\\nheight of the button depends on the font in which the button label is displayed.\\nFor the example button creation code, assume that a window is keeping track of\\nBView and BButton objects in data members named fView and fButton, respectively, and that the button\\'s message type is defined by the constant BUTTON_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_MSG\\n\\n\\'bttn\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nprivate:\\nBView\\nBButton\\n\\n*fView;\\n*fButton;\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe code that creates a new button and adds it to the view fView might then look\\nlike this:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, \"MyButton\",\\n\"Click Me\", new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfView->AddChild(fButton);\\n\\nMaking a Button the Default Button\\nOne button in a window can be made the default button--a button that the user\\ncan select either by clicking or by pressing the Enter key. If a button is the default\\nbutton, it is given a wider border so that the user recognizes it as such a button.\\nTo make a button the default button, call the BButton member function\\nMakeDefault():\\nfButton->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nIf the window that holds the new default button already had a default button, the\\nold default button automatically loses its default status and becomes a \"normal\"\\nbutton. The system handles this task to ensure that a window has only one default\\nbutton.\\nWhile granting one button default status may be a user-friendly gesture, it might\\nalso not make sense in many cases. Thus, a window isn\\'t required to have a\\ndefault button.\\n\\nButton Example Project\\nThe TwoButtons project demonstrates how to create a window that holds two buttons. Looking at Figure 6-4, you can guess that a click on the leftmost button\\n(which is the default button) results in the playing of the system sound a single\\ntime, while a click on the other button produces the beep twice.\\nPreparing the window class for the buttons\\nA few additions to the code in the MyHelloWindow.h file are in order. First, a pair\\nof constants are defined to be used later when the buttons are created. The choice\\nof constant names and values is unimportant, provided that the names don\\'t begin\\nwith \"B_\" and that the constant values don\\'t consist of all uppercase characters.\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-4. The window that results from running the TwoButtons program\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s two buttons, a pair of data members of type\\nBButton are added to the already present data member of type MyDrawView. And\\nnow that the window will be receiving and responding to application-defined\\nmessages, the BWindow-inherited member function MessageReceived() needs to\\noverridden:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the buttons\\nThe buttons are created and added to the window in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, the constructor declares several variables that will be\\nused in the pair of calls to the BButton constructor and assigns them values:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*buttonBeep2Label = \"Beep Two\";\\n\\nIn the past, you\\'ve seen that I normally declare a variable within the routine that\\nuses it, just before its use. Here I\\'ve declared the six variables that are used as\\nBButton constructor arguments outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor--but\\nthey could just as well have been declared within the MyHelloWindow constructor. I opted to do things this way to get in the habit of grouping all of a window\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nlayout-defining code together. Grouping all the button boundary rectangles,\\nnames, and labels together makes it easier to lay out the buttons in relation to one\\nanother and to supply them with logical, related names and labels. This technique\\nis especially helpful when a window holds several controls.\\nThe buttons will be added to the fMyView view. Recall that this view is of the\\nBView-derived application-defined class MyDrawView and occupies the entire content area of a MyHelloWindow. In the MyHelloWindow constructor, the view is\\ncreated first, and then the buttons are created and added to the view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling button clicks\\nMessageReceived() always has a similar format. The Application Server passes\\nthis function a message as an argument. The message data member what holds\\nthe message type, so that data member should be examined in a switch statement, with the result compared to any application-defined message types the window is capable of handling. A window of type MyHelloWindow can handle a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_1_MSG and a BUTTON_BEEP_2_MSG. If a different type of message is\\nencountered, it gets passed on to the BWindow version of MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPicture Buttons\\nA picture button is a button that has a picture on its face rather than a text label.\\nThe picture button behaves like a standard push button--clicking and releasing\\nthe mouse button while over the picture button selects it.\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a picture button. Associated with one\\nBPictureButton object are two BPicture objects. One of the pictures acts as the\\nbutton when the button is in its normal state (that is, when the user isn\\'t clicking\\non it). The other picture acts as the button when the user clicks on the button.\\nYou\\'ll supply a BPictureButton object with the two pictures, and the system will\\nbe responsible for switching back and forth between the pictures in response to\\nthe user\\'s actions.\\n\\nCreating a Picture Button\\nA picture button is created by the BPictureButton constructor. As is the case for\\nother controls, this constructor invokes the BControl constructor, which in turn\\ninvokes the BView constructor:\\nBPictureButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*off,\\n*on,\\n*message,\\nbehavior = B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BPictureButton constructor has eight parameters, five of which you\\'re\\nalready familiar with. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags parameters\\nget passed to the BView constructor and are used in setting up the picture button\\nas a view. The message parameter is used by the BControl constructor to assign\\na message type to the picture button. The remaining three parameters, off, on,\\nand behavior, are specific to the creation of a picture button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nThe off and on parameters are BPicture objects that define the two pictures to\\nbe used to display the button. In Chapter 5, you saw how to create a BPicture\\nobject using the BPicture member functions BeginPicture() and\\nEndPicture(). Here I create a picture composed of a white circle within a black\\ncircle:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\n\\nA second BPicture object should then be created in the same way. These two\\nBPicture objects could then be used as the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBPictureButton constructor.\\n\\nFor more compelling graphic images, you can use bitmaps for button pictures. Once a bitmap exists, all that needs to appear between\\nthe BeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls is a call to the BView\\nmember function DrawBitMap(). Chapter 10, Files, discusses bitmaps.\\n\\nPicture buttons are actually more versatile than described in this section. Here the\\npicture button is treated as a one-state device--just as a standard push button is.\\nThe BPictureButton class can also be used, however, to create a picture button\\nthat is a two-state control. Setting the behavior parameter to the constant B_TWO_\\nSTATE_BUTTON tells the BPictureButton constructor to create a picture button\\nthat, when clicked on, toggles between the two pictures represented by the\\nBPicture parameters off and on. Clicking on such a picture button displays one\\npicture. Clicking on the button again displays the second picture. The displayed\\npicture indicates to the user the current state of the button. To see a good realworld use of a two-state picture button, run the BeIDE. Then choose Find from\\nthe Edit menu. In the lower-left area of the Find window you\\'ll find a button that\\nhas a picture of a small file icon on it. Click on the button and it will now have a\\npicture of two small file icons on it. This button is used to toggle between two\\nsearch options: search only the currently open, active file, and search all files\\npresent in the Find window list. Figure 6-5 shows both of this button\\'s two states.\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe two states of the same\\npicture button\\n\\nFigure 6-5. The Find window of the BeIDE provides an example of a picture button\\n\\nPicture Button Example Project\\nThe PictureButton project creates a program that displays a window that holds a\\nsingle picture button. Figure 6-6 shows this one window under two different conditions. The leftmost window in the figure shows the button in its normal state.\\nThe rightmost window shows that when the button is clicked it gets slightly\\nsmaller and its center is filled in.\\n\\nFigure 6-6. The window that results from running the PictureButton program\\n\\nThe picture button can include other pictures, which will be used if\\nthe program lets the button be disabled. Now that you know the\\nbasics of working with the BPictureButton class, the details of\\nenhancing your picture buttons will be a quick read in the\\nBPictureButton section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be\\nBook.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the picture button\\nThis chapter\\'s TwoButtons example project (presented in the \"Buttons\" section)\\nprovided a plan for adding a control, and support of that control, to a window.\\nHere\\'s how the window class header file (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this\\nproject) is set up for a new control:\\n\\n\\nDefine a constant to be used to represent an application-defined message type\\n\\n\\n\\nOverride MessageReceived() in the window class declaration\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a control data member in the window class declaration\\n\\nHere\\'s how the MyHelloWindow class is affected by the addition of a picture button to a window of this class type:\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fPicButtonBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nI\\'ve defined the PICTURE_BEEP_MSG constant to have a value of\\n\\'bep1\\'. Looking back at the TwoButtons example project, you\\'ll see\\nthat this is the same value I gave to that project\\'s BUTTON_BEEP_1_\\nMSG constant. If both controls were present in the same application,\\nI\\'d give one of these two constants a different value so that the\\nMessageReceived() function could distinguish between a click on\\nthe Beep One push button and a click on the picture button.\\n\\nCreating the picture button\\nThe process of creating a control can also be expressed in a number of steps. All\\nof the following affect the window source code file (the MyHelloWindow.cpp file\\nin this particular example):\\n\\n\\nDeclare and assign values to the variables to be used in the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate the control using new and the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach the control to the window by adding it to one of the window\\'s views\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nFollowing the above steps to add a picture button to the MyHelloWindow constructor results in a new version of this routine that looks like this:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n*buttonOnPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect offRect;\\nfMyView->FillRect(offRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(offRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect onRect;\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOnPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfPicButtonBeep = new BPictureButton(pictureBeep1Rect, pictureBeep1Name,\\nbuttonOffPict, buttonOnPict,\\nnew BMessage(PICTURE_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fPicButtonBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe two BPicture objects are defined using a few of the basic drawing techniques covered in Chapter 5. As you read the following, refer back to the picture\\nbutton in its off state (normal, or unclicked) and on state (being clicked) in\\nFigure 6-5.\\nThe off picture fills in a rectangle with the B_SOLID_LOW pattern (solid white) to\\nerase the on picture that might currently be displayed (if the user has just clicked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nthe picture button, the on picture will be serving as the picture button). Then a\\nrectangle is outlined to serve as the off button.\\nThe on picture erases the off picture (should it be currently drawn to the window\\nas the picture button) by drawing a white (B_SOLID_LOW) rectangle outline with\\nthe boundaries of the off picture rectangle. That rectangle is then inset two pixels\\nin each direction and a new rectangle is framed in black (B_SOLID_HIGH). The\\nrectangle is then inset two more pixels, and this new area is filled with black.\\nHandling a picture button click\\nTo handle a click on the picture button, MessageReceived() now looks for a\\nmessage of type PICTURE_BEEP_MSG. Should that message reach the window, the\\ncomputer sounds the system beep one time:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckboxes\\nThe BCheckBox class is used to add checkboxes to a window. A BCheckBox\\nobject includes both the checkbox itself and a label, or title, to the right of the\\nbox. A checkbox is a two-state control: in the on state, the checkbox has an \"X\" in\\nit; when off, it is empty. When a user clicks on a checkbox, its state is toggled. It\\'s\\nworthy of note that a checkbox label is considered a part of the checkbox control. That means that a user\\'s click on the checkbox itself or anywhere on the\\ncheckbox label will toggle the checkbox to its opposite state.\\nWhether a click results in a checkbox being turned on (checked) or off\\n(unchecked), a message is sent to the window that holds the checkbox. While a\\nprogram can immediately respond to a click on a checkbox, it is more typical for\\nthe program to wait until some other action takes place before responding. For\\ninstance, the setting of some program feature could be done via a checkbox.\\nClicking the checkbox wouldn\\'t, however, immediately change the setting. Instead,\\nwhen the user dismisses the window the checkbox resides in, the value of the\\ncheckbox can be queried and the setting of the program feature could be performed at that time.\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nCreating a Checkbox\\nThe BCheckBox constructor has six parameters:\\nBCheckBox(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BCheckBox parameters match those used in the BButton constructor--if you\\nknow how to create a button, you know how to create a checkbox. Adding to the\\nsimilarities is that after you attach the checkbox to a window, the control\\'s height\\nwill be automatically adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the control\\'s label. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates don\\'t produce a\\nrectangle with a height sufficient to display the checkbox label, the BCheckBox\\nconstructor will increase the checkbox boundary rectangle height by increasing the\\nvalue of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact height of the checkbox\\ndepends on the font in which the control\\'s label is displayed.\\nAs for other control types, you\\'ll define a message constant that is to be paired\\nwith the control. For instance:\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_MSG\\n\\n\\'ckbx\\'\\n\\nThen, optionally, add a data member of the control type to the class declaration of\\nthe window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBButton\\n*fCheckBox;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet is typical of the code you\\'ll write to create a new checkbox\\nand add that control to a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfCheckBox = new BCheckBox(checkBoxRect,\"MyCheckbox\"\\n\"Check Me\", new BMessage(CHECKBOX_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBox);\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Now) Example Project\\nClicking a checkbox may have an immediate effect on some aspect of the program, or it may not have an impact on the program until the user confirms the\\ncheckbox selection--usually by a click on a button. The former use of a check-\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nbox is demonstrated in the example project described here: CheckBoxNow. For an\\nexample of the other usage, a checkbox that has an effect after another action is\\ntaken, look over the next example, the CheckBoxLater project.\\nThe use of a checkbox to initiate an immediate action is often in practice when\\nsome area of the window the checkbox resides in is to be altered. For instance, if\\nsome controls in a window are to be rendered unusable in certain conditions, a\\ncheckbox can be used to disable (and then later enable) these controls. This is\\nhow the checkbox in the CheckBoxNow example works. The CheckBoxNow\\nproject creates a program with a window that holds two controls: a button and a\\ncheckbox. When the program launches, both controls are enabled, and the checkbox is unchecked--as shown in the top window in Figure 6-7. As expected, clicking on the Beep One button produces a single system beep. Clicking on the\\ncheckbox disables beeping by disabling the button. The bottom window in\\nFigure 6-7 shows how the program\\'s one window looks after clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox.\\n\\nFigure 6-7. The windows that result from running the CheckBoxNow program\\n\\nPreparing the Window class for the checkbox\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h file prepares for the window\\'s support of a button and a\\ncheckbox by defining a constant for each control\\'s message:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'stbp\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class now holds three data members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nBButton\\nBCheckBox\\n\\n*fCheckBoxSetBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the checkbox\\nI\\'ve declared and initialized the button and checkbox boundary rectangles near\\none another so that I could line them up--Figure 6-6 shows that the checkbox is\\njust to the right of the button and centered vertically with the button.\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*checkBoxSetBeepName = \"SetBeep\";\\n= \"Beep One\";\\n*checkBoxSetBeepLabel = \"Disable Beeping\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates both the button and checkbox:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfCheckBoxSetBeep = new BCheckBox(checkBoxSetBeepRect, checkBoxSetBeepName,\\ncheckBoxSetBeepLabel,\\nnew BMessage(CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBoxSetBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a checkbox click\\nWhen the checkbox is clicked, the system will toggle it to its opposite state and\\nthen send a message of the application-defined type CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG to\\nthe MyHelloWindow MessageReceived() routine. In response, this message\\'s\\ncase section obtains the new state of the checkbox and enables or disables the\\nBeep One button as appropriate. If the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, or\\non, the button is disabled by passing a value of false to the button\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nSetEnabled() routine. If the checkbox is unchecked, or off, a value of true is\\npassed to this same routine in order to enable the button:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, deactivate beep button\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, activate beep button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Later) Example Project\\nThe CheckBoxNow project responds immediately to a click on a checkbox. More\\noften, programs let users check or uncheck the checkboxes without any immediate effect. Thus, your program might reserve action until the choice is confirmed\\nby the user\\'s click on a button (such as OK, Done, or Accept). The CheckBoxLater project demonstrates this approach. Figure 6-7 shows that the CheckBoxLater program displays a window that looks similar to that displayed by the\\nCheckBoxNow program. The program differs in when the state of the checkbox is\\nqueried by the program. In the CheckBoxLater program, clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox any number of times has no immediate effect on the Beep One\\nbutton (in Figure 6-8, you see that the checkbox is checked, yet the button isn\\'t\\ndisabled). It\\'s only when the user clicks the Beep One button that the program\\nchecks to see if the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked. If it isn\\'t checked, the\\nbutton click plays the system beep. If it is checked, the button can still be clicked,\\nbut no sound will be played.\\nThe only changes that were made to the CheckBoxNow code to turn it into the\\ncode for the CheckBoxLater project are in the MessageReceived() function.\\nHere\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-8. The window that results from running the CheckBoxLater program\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, meaning DON\\'T beep\\n;\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, meaning DO beep\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\n// Here we don\\'t do anything. Instead, we wait until the user\\n// performs some other action before checking the value of the\\n// checkbox break;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIn MessageReceived(), the body of the CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case section\\nperforms no action--a message of this type is now essentially ignored. The program would run the same even if this case section was removed, but I\\'ve left the\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case label in the switch so that it\\'s evident that\\nMessageReceived() is still the recipient of such messages.\\n\\nRadio Buttons\\nA radio button is similar to a checkbox in that it is a two-state control. Unlike a\\ncheckbox, though, a radio button always appears grouped with at least one other\\ncontrol of its kind.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFor any given radio button group, no more than one radio button can be on at\\nany time. When the user clicks on one button in a group, the button that was on\\nat the time of the click is turned off and the newly clicked button is turned on. A\\nradio button group is responsible for updating the state of its buttons--your code\\nwon\\'t need to turn them on and off.\\n\\nCreating a Radio Button\\nThe BRadioButton constructor has the same six parameters described back in this\\nchapter\\'s \"The BControl class\" section:\\nBRadioButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nLike other types of controls, a radio button\\'s height will be adjusted if the height\\nspecified in the frame rectangle isn\\'t enough to accommodate the font being used\\nto display the radio button\\'s label.\\nBefore creating a new radio button, define a constant to be used as the control\\'s\\nmessage type. Here\\'s an example from a project that has two radio buttons in a\\nwindow:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess to a radio button is easiest if a data member of the control type is added to\\nthe class declaration of the window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet shows the creation of two radio buttons, each of which is\\nadded to the same view:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\"One\", new BMessage(RADIO_1_MSG));\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\n\"Two\", new BMessage(RADIO_2_MSG));\\n\\nBy adding radio buttons to the same view, you designate that the buttons be considered a part of a radio button group. The simple act of placing a number of buttons in the same view is enough to have these buttons act in unison. A click on\\none radio button turns that button on, but not until that button turns off all other\\nradio buttons in the same view.\\nA single window can have any number of radio button groups, or sets. For\\ninstance, a window might have one group of three buttons that provides the user\\nwith the option of displaying graphic images in monochrome, grayscale, or color.\\nThis same window could also have a radio button group that provides the user\\nwith a choice of four filters to apply to the image. In such a scenario, the window\\nwould need to include a minimum of two views--one for the group of three\\ncolor-level radio buttons and another for the group of four filter radio buttons.\\n\\nRadio Buttons Example Project\\nThe RadioButtonGroup project demonstrates how to create a group of radio buttons. As shown in Figure 6-9, the RadioButtonGroup program\\'s window includes a\\ngroup of three radio buttons that allow the user to alter the behavior of the Beep\\npush button.\\n\\nFigure 6-9. The window that results from running the RadioButtonGroup program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the radio buttons\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file includes four control message constants--one\\nper control. The push button constant has been given the value \\'bEEp\\' just to\\nillustrate that an application-defined message constant can include uppercase characters (to avoid conflicting with Be-defined control message constants, it just\\nshouldn\\'t consist of all uppercase characters).\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\'bEEp\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nThis project\\'s version of the MyHelloWindow class includes six data members: one\\nto keep track of the window\\'s view, one to keep track of each of the window\\'s\\nfour controls, and one to keep track of the number of beeps to play when the\\npush button is clicked:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLaying out the radio buttons\\nA number of radio buttons are defined as a group when they all reside in the same\\nview. A MyHelloWindow object includes a view (MyDrawView) that occupies its\\nentire content area--so I could add the three radio buttons to this view and have\\nthem automatically become a radio button group. That, however, isn\\'t what I\\'m\\nabout to do. Instead, I\\'ll create a new view and add it to the existing view. If at a\\nlater time I want to add a second group of radio buttons (to control some other,\\nunrelated, option) to the window, the buttons that will comprise that group will\\nneed to be in a new view--otherwise they\\'ll just be absorbed into the existing\\nradio button group. By creating a new view that exists just for one group of radio\\nbuttons, I\\'m getting in the habit of setting up a radio button group as an isolated\\nentity.\\nPlacing a radio button group in its own new view also proves beneficial if it\\nbecomes necessary to make a change to the layout of all of the group\\'s radio buttons. For instance, if I want to relocate all of the buttons in a group to another\\narea of the window, I just redefine the group\\'s view rectangle rather than redefining each of the individual radio button boundary rectangles. When the view\\nmoves, so do the radio buttons in it. Or, consider that I may, for aesthetic reasons, want to outline the area that holds the radio buttons. I can easily do so by\\nframing the radio button group view.\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe following variable declarations appear near the top of the MyHelloWindow.\\ncpp file. Note that the boundary rectangle for each of the three radio buttons has a\\nleft coordinate of 10.0, yet the radio buttons are certainly more than 10 pixels in\\nfrom the left side of the window.\\nKeep in mind that after being created, the radio buttons will be added to a new\\nBView that is positioned in the window based on the radioGroupRect rectangle.\\nThus, the coordinate values of the radio button rectangles are relative to the new\\nBView. Figure 6-10 clarifies my point by showing where the radio group view will\\nbe placed in the window. In that figure, the values 125 and 50 come from the left\\nand top values in the radioGroupRect rectangle declared here:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\n*radioBeep1Label = \"One Beep\";\\n*radioBeep2Label = \"Two Beeps\";\\n*radioBeep3Label = \"Three Beeps\";\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-10. A group of radio buttons can reside in their own view\\n\\nCreating the radio buttons\\nThe three radio buttons are created, as expected, in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, a generic view (a view of the Be class BView) to which the\\nradio buttons will be added is created and added to the view of type MyDrawView.\\nBy default, each new radio button is turned off. A group of radio buttons must\\nalways have one button on, so after the three radio buttons are created, one of\\nthem (arbitrarily, the One Beep button) is turned on by calling the button\\'s\\nSetValue() member function. The data member fNumBeeps is then initialized to\\na value that matches the number of beeps indicated by the turned-on radio button:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBView\\n\\n*radioGroupView;\\n\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\",\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a radio button click\\nWhen a radio button is clicked, a message of the appropriate application-defined\\ntype reaches the window\\'s MessageReceived() function. The clicking of a radio\\nbutton, like the clicking of a checkbox, typically doesn\\'t cause an immediate\\naction to occur. Such is the case in this example. MessageReceived() handles\\nthe button click by simply setting the MyHelloWindow data member fNumBeeps to\\nthe value indicated by the clicked-on radio button. When the user eventually clicks\\non the Beep push button, beep() is invoked the appropriate number of times:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 3;\\nbreak;\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nfor (i = 1; i <= fNumBeeps; i++) {\\nbeep();\\nif (i != fNumBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nView Hierarchy and Controls\\nChapter 4 introduced the concept of the window view hierarchy--the organization of views within a window. In this chapter\\'s most recent example you\\'ve just\\nseen a window that included a number of views (keeping in mind that a control is\\na type of view). Now that you\\'ve encountered the first example that includes several views, this a good time to revisit the topic of the view hierarchy in order to fill\\nin some of the details. Figure 6-11 shows the view hierarchy for a window--an\\nobject of the MyHelloWindow class--from the RadioButtonGroup program.\\nAdding views to the hierarchy\\nA window\\'s top view is always a \"built-in\" part of the window--you don\\'t explicitly add the top view as you add other views. The BView-derived fMyView view\\nlies directly below the top view, telling you that this view has been added to the\\nwindow. The BButton fButtonBeep1 view and the BView radioGroupView lie\\ndirectly below the fMyView view, so you know that each has been added to\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTop View\\n\\nfmyView\\n\\n\\nradioGroupView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-11. The view hierarchy for the RadioButtonGroup window\\n\\nfMyView. Finally, the three BRadioButton views are beneath radioGroupView,\\ntelling you that these three views have been added to radioGroupView. You can\\nconfirm this by looking at the six AddChild() calls in the MyHelloWindow constructor--they indicate which parent view each view was added to:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n...\\n...\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAccessing views\\nThe names of the views in Figure 6-12 tell you how each view is referenced.\\nYou don\\'t draw to the top view--it merely serves as a container for organizing\\nother views. To reference this view (as when adding a view to the window), reference the window itself. In the window\\'s constructor, just call the desired BWindow\\nmember function, as in:\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFrom outside a window member function, use the fMyWindow data member from\\nthe MyHelloApplication object. If the fMyView view was to be added in the\\nBApplication constructor after the window was created, the call to AddChild()\\nwould look like this:\\nfMyWindow->AddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe Be naming convention states that the name of a class data member should\\nstart with a lowercase \"f\" character. In Figure 6-11 you see that five of the six\\nviews below the top view are referenced by data members. To work with any one\\nof these views, use the data member that references it. For instance, to invoke the\\nBView member function FillRect() to fill a rectangle in the window\\'s fMyView\\nview, just call the routine like this:\\nfMyView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nI haven\\'t kept a data member reference in the MyHelloWindow class to the BView\\nthat groups the three radio buttons. If it became necessary to reference this view,\\nyou could call the BView member function FindView() to locate the view object\\nand return a reference to it. Recall that when a view is created, you give it a name.\\nFor example, the radio group view was given the name \"RadioView\":\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n\\nYou can find the view at any time by calling FindView() from the parent view.\\nFor instance, to fill a rectangle in the radio group view, call FindView() from that\\nview\\'s parent view, fMyView:\\nBView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\naView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nKeep in mind that there are always two, and may be three, references, associated with one view. When a view is created, the view\\nobject is returned to the program and referenced by a variable (such\\nas radioGroupView in the preceding example). When invoking the\\nBView (or BView-derived) class constructor, a name for the view is\\nsupplied in quotes (as in \"RadioView\" in the preceding example).\\nFinally, some views have a label--a name that is displayed on the\\nview itself (as in a control such as a BButton--the button displays a\\nname such as OK or Beep).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nView Updating\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, the MyHelloWindow constructor creates a view\\nreferenced by the MyHelloWindow data member fMyView and a view referenced\\nby the local BView variable radioGroupView. This one MyHelloWindow constructor shows two ways of working with views, so it will be worth our while to again\\nsidetrack from the discussion of controls in order to gain a better understanding of\\nthe very important topic of views.\\nBView-derived classes and the generic BView class\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, and several projects preceding it, I\\'ve opted to\\nfill the content area of a window with a view of the application-defined BViewderived class MyDrawView. One of the chief reasons for defining such a class is to\\nlet the system become responsible for updating a view. This is accomplished by\\nhaving my own class override the BView member function Draw().\\nA second way to work with a view is to not define a view class, but instead simply create a generic BView object within an application-derived routine. That\\'s\\nwhat the RadioButtonGroup project does in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\n\\nAfter you attach the new view to an existing view, drawing can take place in the\\nnew view. For instance, if in addition to beeping, you want the program to draw a\\nborder around the three radio buttons in response to a click on the window\\'s one\\npush button, add the following code under the BUTTON_BEEP_MSG case label in\\nthe MessageReceived() function:\\nBView\\nBRect\\n\\n*radioView;\\nradioFrame;\\n\\nradioView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\nradioFrame = radioView->Bounds();\\nradioView->StrokeRect(radioFrame);\\n\\nSuperficially, this approach of creating a generic BView and then drawing in it is\\nsimpler than defining a BView-derived class and then implementing a Draw()\\nfunction for that class. But in taking this easier approach, you lose the benefit of\\nhaving the system take responsibility for updating the view. Consider the above\\nsnippet. That code will nicely frame the three radio buttons. But if the window\\nthat holds the buttons ever needs updating (and if the user is allowed to move the\\nwindow, of course at some point it will), the frame that surrounds the buttons\\nwon\\'t be redrawn. The system will indeed invoke a Draw() function for\\nradioGroupView, but it will be the empty BView version of Draw().\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nImplementing a BView-derived class in the RadioButtonGroup project\\nWhat if I do want my RadioButtonGroup program to frame the radio buttons, and\\nto do so in a way that automatically updates the frame as needed? Instead of placing the radio buttons in a generic BView object, I can define a new BView-derived\\nclass just for this purpose:\\nclass MyRadioView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyRadioView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyRadioView constructor can be empty--just as the MyDrawView constructor\\nis:\\nMyRadioView::MyRadioView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyRadioView version of the Draw() function is quite simple as well:\\nvoid MyRadioView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nWhile I could keep track of an instance of the MyRadioView class by calling the\\nparent view\\'s FindView() function as needed, I\\'d opt for the method of storing a\\nreference to the view in the window that will hold the view. Here I\\'ve added such\\na reference to the six existing data members in the MyHelloWindow class of the\\nRadioButtonGroup project:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nMyRadioView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n*fMyRadioView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create a MyRadioView object, I replace the generic BView creation code in the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor with the following:\\nfMyRadioView = new MyRadioView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\");\\nfMyView->AddChild(fMyRadioView);\\n\\nNow, when a radio button is created, I add it to the MyRadioView object\\nfMyRadioView, like this:\\n\\nThanks to the Draw() function of the MyRadioView class, the new radio button\\ngroup will have a border drawn around it, exactly as was shown back in\\nFigure 6-10. Better yet, obscuring the window and then bringing it back to the\\nforefront doesn\\'t cause the border to disappear--the update message that the\\nApplication Server sends to the MyHelloWindow window results in the calling of\\nthe Draw() function of each \"out-of-date\" view in the window.\\nIf you want to see all of the code for this new version of the RadioButtonGroup\\nprogram, you\\'ll find it in the RadioButtonGroupFrame project.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve followed this discussion, you should be able to quickly\\nanswer the following question: in the original RadioButtonGroup\\nproject, why didn\\'t I create a new BView-derived class like the\\nMyRadioView class and use an object of that type to hold the radio\\nbuttons? Answer: because I use the radio button view only as a\\nmeans to group the radio buttons together--I don\\'t draw to the\\nview. The simple approach of creating a BView on the fly works for\\nthat purpose.\\n\\nText Fields\\nThe BTextControl class is used to add a text field to a window. A text field consists of both a static, uneditable label and an editable field that allows the user to\\nenter a single line of text. The label appears to the left of the editable field, and is\\ngenerally used to provide the user with an idea of what to enter in the editable\\nfield (\"Enter your age in years:\" is an example).\\nA text field is often handled like a checkbox or radio button: no immediate action\\nis taken by the program in response to the user\\'s action. Typically, the program\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nacquires the text in the text field only when a button labeled OK, Accept, Save, or\\nsomething similar is clicked on.\\nIf your program needs to get or set the editable text of a text field as soon as the\\nuser has finished typing, the BTextControl accommodates you. Like other controls, a text field issues a message that will be received by the\\nMessageReceived() function of the control\\'s window. Such a message is sent\\nwhen the control determines that the user has finished entering text in the editable field, as indicated by a press of the Enter, Return, or Tab key or a mouse button click in the editable field of a different text field control. In all of these\\ninstances, the text that was previously in the editable field must have been modified in order for the control to send the message. If the user, say, clicks in an editable field of a text field, then presses the Enter key, no message will be sent.\\n\\nCreating a Text Field\\nThe BTextControl constructor has six parameters common to all controls, along\\nwith a text parameter that specifies a string that is to initially appear in the editable field of the text field control:\\nBTextControl(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*text,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nPassing a string in the text parameter of the BTextControl constructor is useful\\nif you want to alert the user that a default string or value is to be used in the event\\nthat the user doesn\\'t enter a string or value. If a value of NULL is passed as the\\ntext parameter, no text initially appears in the editable field.\\nAs with all control types, you must define a unique message constant that will be\\npaired with the control. To assist in keeping track of the text field control, you can\\noptionally include a data member in the window class in which the control is to\\nreside:\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_FIELD_MSG\\n\\n\\'txtf\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBTextControl *fTextField;\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create the control, pass the BTextControl constructor a boundary rectangle,\\nname, static text label, initial editable text, and a new BMessage object. Then add\\nthe new text field to the view the control will reside in:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Number of dependents:\", \"0\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nGetting and Setting the Text\\nAfter creating a text field control, your program can obtain or set the editable field\\ntext at any time. To obtain the text currently in the text field, invoke the\\nBTextControl member function Text(). Here, the text in a control is returned to\\nthe program and saved to a string named textFieldText:\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n\\nThe text that appears in the editable field of the control is initially set in the\\nBTextControl constructor, and is then edited by the user. The contents of the\\neditable field can also be set at any time by your program by invoking the\\nBTextControl member function SetText(). This routine overwrites the current\\ncontents of the editable field with the string that was passed to SetText(). Here\\nthe current contents of a control\\'s editable field are obtained and checked for\\nvalidity. If the user-entered string isn\\'t consistent with what\\'s expected, the string\\n\"Invalid Entry\" is written in place of the incorrect text the user entered:\\nchar\\nbool\\n\\n*textFieldText;\\ntextValid;\\n\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n...\\n// check for validity of user-entered text that\\'s now held in textFieldText\\n...\\nif (!textValid)\\nfTextField->SetText(\"Invalid Entry\");\\n\\nReproportioning the Static Text and Editable\\nText Areas\\nThe label parameter specifies the static text that is to appear to the left of the\\neditable field. If NULL is passed here, all of the control\\'s boundary rectangle (as\\ndefined by the frame parameter) is devoted to the text field. Any label string\\nother than NULL tells the constructor to devote half the width of the frame\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nrectangle to the static text label and the other half of this rectangle to the editable\\ntext area. Consider this snippet:\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Name:\", \"George Washington Carver\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nIn this code, a text field control with a width of 200 pixels is created. By default,\\nthe static text field and the editable text field of the control each have a width that\\nis one-half of the control\\'s boundary rectangle, or 100 pixels. The result is shown\\nin the top window in Figure 6-12. Because the label is a short string, and because\\nthe value that might be entered in the editable text field may be a long string, it\\nwould make sense and be more aesthetically pleasing to change the proportions\\nof the two text areas. Instead of devoting 100 pixels to the static text label\\n\"Name:\", it would be better to give that text just, say, 35 pixels of the 200 pixels\\nthat make up the control\\'s width. Such reproportioning is possible using the\\nBTextControl member function SetDivider().\\n\\nFigure 6-12. The two areas of a text field control can be proportioned in different ways\\n\\nWhen passed a floating-point value, SetDivider() re-establishes the dividing\\npoint between the two text areas of a text field control. SetDivider() uses the\\nBTextControl object\\'s local coordinate system (meaning that the left edge of the\\ntext edit control has a value of 0.0, regardless of where the control is positioned in\\na window). The following addition to the above snippet changes the ratio to 35\\npixels for the static text field and 165 pixels for the editable text field. The bottom\\nwindow in Figure 6-12 shows the result. Notice that the placement and overall\\nwidth of the control are unaffected by the call to SetDivider().\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nfloat\\n\\nxCoordinate = 35.0;\\n\\nfTextField->SetDivider(xCoordinate);\\n\\nText Field Example Project\\nThe TextField project demonstrates how to include a text field in a window, obtain\\nthat control\\'s user-entered string, and make use of that string elsewhere. When the\\nuser clicks the window\\'s button, the program gets the string from the text field and\\nuses that string as the new label for the push button. Figure 6-13 shows the program\\'s window after the button has been clicked.\\n\\nFigure 6-13. The window that results from running the TextField program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the text field\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file is edited to include a control message constant\\nfor the window\\'s two controls.\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG\\n\\n\\'newT\\'\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s views, the MyHelloWindow class now holds three\\ndata members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBTextControl\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNewTitle;\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nCreating the text field\\nThe text field and button information are defined together just before the implementation of the MyHelloWindow constructor. The push button label will initially\\nbe \"Beep One\" and the text that will appear initially in the editable field of the text\\nfield control is the string \"Beep Me!\":\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*textNewTitleName = \"TextTitle\";\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*textNewTitleLabel = \"Enter New Button Name:\";\\n*textNewTitleText = \"Beep Me!\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates the window\\'s main view, then creates\\nand adds the button control and text field control to that view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfTextNewTitle = new BTextControl(textNewTitleRect, textNewTitleName,\\ntextNewTitleLabel, textNewTitleText,\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextNewTitle);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a text field entry and a button click\\nA program can make use of a text field control in two ways. First, a window can\\nobtain the user-entered text from a text field control at any time--without regard\\nfor whether the text field has issued a message. Second, a window can await a\\nmessage sent by the text field and then respond. The MessageReceived() function demonstrates both these options.\\nWhen the window\\'s push button is clicked, the window receives a message from\\nthe button. At that time, the editable text of the text field control is retrieved and\\nused in a call to the button\\'s SetLabel() function. While the retrieving of the text\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nfield control\\'s editable text takes place in response to a message, that message is\\none issued by the push button--not the text field control.\\nWhen the user clicks in the text field, that control becomes the focus view. Recall\\nfrom Chapter 4 that a window can have only one focus view, and that view\\nbecomes the recipient of keystrokes. Once a text field is the focus view (as indicated by the editable text field being highlighted and the I-beam appearing in it),\\nand once that control\\'s editable text has been altered in any way, the control is\\ncapable of sending a message. That happens when the user presses the Return,\\nEnter, or Tab key. In response to a message sent by the text field control,\\nMessageReceived() resets the push button\\'s label to its initial title of \"Beep One\"\\n(as defined by the buttonBeep1Label constant):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNewTitle->Text();\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMultiple Control Example Project\\nThe numerous example projects in this chapter demonstrated how to incorporate\\none, or perhaps two, types of controls in a window. Your real-world program\\nmight very well include numerous controls. ControlDemo is such a program--its\\none window holds the six controls shown in Figure 6-14.\\nTo use ControlDemo, enter a number in the range of 1 to 9 in the text field control, click a radio button control to choose one of three drawing colors, then click\\nthe Draw button. The ControlDemo program responds by drawing colored, overlapping circles. The number of circles drawn is determined by the value entered in\\nthe text field. Before drawing the circles, ControlDemo erases the drawing area--\\nso you can try as many combinations of circles and colors as you want. You can\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-14. The window that results from running the ControlDemo program\\n\\nalso click the Disable colors checkbox to disable the radio buttons and force drawing to take place in the last selected color.\\n\\nPreparing the Window Class for the Controls\\nThe program\\'s window holds six controls, so you can expect to see six application-defined message constants in the MyHelloWindow.h file:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_DRAW_MSG\\nRADIO_RED_MSG\\nRADIO_GREEN_MSG\\nRADIO_BLACK_MSG\\nTEXT_NUM_CIRCLES_MSG\\nCHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG\\n\\n\\'draw\\'\\n\\'rred\\'\\n\\'rgrn\\'\\n\\'rblk\\'\\n\\'crcl\\'\\n\\'setc\\'\\n\\nEach control is kept track of by a data member in the MyHelloWindow class.\\nThere\\'s also the familiar data member that exists to keep track of the window\\'s\\nmain view:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBTextControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBButton\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNumCircles;\\n*fCheckBoxSetColor;\\n*fRadioRed;\\n*fRadioGreen;\\n*fRadioBlack;\\n*fButtonDraw;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nCreating the Controls\\nAll of the variables that are to be used as arguments to the control constructors are\\ndeclared together in MyHelloWindow.cpp. Each of the controls is then created in\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor. There are no surprises here--just use new with\\nthe appropriate control constructor and assign the resulting object to the proper\\nMyHelloWindow data member.\\nYou should be quite familiar with this process by now. To see the complete\\nMyHelloWindow constructor listing, refer to MyHelloWindow.cpp.\\n\\nHandling the Messages\\nAll application-defined control messages are handled in the body of the switch\\nstatement in MessageReceived(). The checkbox message is handled by first\\nchecking the control\\'s value, then disabling or enabling the three radio buttons as\\nappropriate:\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetColor->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON) {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(false);\\n}\\nelse {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(true);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nEach of the radio buttons does nothing more than set the high color to an RGB\\ncolor that matches the button\\'s label:\\ncase RADIO_RED_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_GREEN_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_BLACK_MSG:\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nClicking the Draw button results in a number of colored circles being drawn. Here\\nthe text field value is obtained to see how many circles to draw, and the high\\ncolor is used in the drawing of those circles. Before drawing the circles, any old\\ndrawing is erased by whiting out an area of the window that is at least as big as\\nthe drawing area:\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nnumCircles;\\ni;\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst char *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNumCircles->Text();\\nnumCircles = (int32)textFieldText[0] - 48;\\nif ((numCircles < 1) || (numCircles > 9))\\nnumCircles = 5;\\nfMyView->FillRect(areaRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfor (i=1; i<=numCircles; i++) {\\nfMyView->StrokeEllipse(circleRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe text field message is completely ignored. The program obtains the editable\\ntext when the user clicks the Draw button. As written, the program checks the text\\nfield input to see if the user entered a numeric character in the range of 1 to 9. If\\nany other value (or character or string) has been entered, the program arbitrarily\\nsets the number of circles to draw to five. This is a less-than-perfect way of doing\\nthings in that it allows the user to enter an invalid value. One way to improve the\\nprogram would be to have the program react to a text field control message. That\\ntype of message is delivered to MessageReceived() when the user ends a typing session (that is, when the user clicks elsewhere, or presses the Enter, Return,\\nor Tab key). MessageReceived() could then check the user-entered value and, if\\ninvalid, set the editable text area to a valid value (and, perhaps, post a window\\nthat informs the user what has taken place).\\n\\nModifying the ControlDemo Project\\nWhat the program draws isn\\'t important to the demonstration of how to include a\\nnumber of controls in a window. With the graphics information found in Chapter 4\\nyou should be able to modify ControlDemo so that it draws something far more\\ninteresting. Begin by enlarging the window so that you have some working room.\\nIn the MyHelloWorld.cpp file, change the size of the BRect passed to the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nMyHelloWindow constructor. Here I\\'m setting the window to have a width of 500\\npixels and a height of 300 pixels:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nLimiting drawing to only three colors isn\\'t a very user-friendly thing to do, so your\\nnext change might be to include a BColorControl object that lets the user\\nchoose any of the 256 system colors. The details of working with a color control\\nwere covered back in Chapter 5. Recall that you can easily support this type of\\ncontrol by first adding a BColorControl data member to the MyHelloWindow\\nclass:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nBColorControl\\n*fColorControl;\\n};\\n\\nThen, in the MyHelloWindow constructor, create the control and add it to the window. You\\'ll need to determine the appropriate coordinates for the BPoint and a\\nsuitable Be-defined constant for the color_control_layout in order to position\\nthe color control in the window you\\'re designing:\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_4x64;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n\\nFinally, when it comes time to draw, check to see which color the user has\\nselected from the color control. You can do that when the user clicks the Draw\\nbutton:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n// now load up this section with plenty of graphics-drawing code\\nbreak;\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nNow, review Chapter 4 to come up some ideas for drawing some really interesting graphics. Then add them under the BUTTON_DRAW_MSG case label in\\nMessageReceived()!\\n\\x0c\\nMenus\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Menu Basics\\n Working with Menus\\n Multiple Menus\\n Pop-up Menus\\n Submenus\\n\\n7.\\n\\nMenus are the interface between the user and the program, and are the primary\\nmeans by which a user carries out tasks. A Be program that makes use of menus\\nusually places a menubar along the top of the content area of each application\\nwindow--though it\\'s easy enough to instead specify that a menubar appear elsewhere in a window.\\nA menu is composed of menu items, and resides in a menubar. You\\'ll rely on the\\nBMenuBar, BMenu, and BMenuItem classes to create menubar, menu, and menu\\nitem objects. Early in this chapter, you\\'ll see how to create objects of these types\\nand how to interrelate them to form a functioning menubar. After these menubar\\nbasics are described, the chapter moves to specific menu-related tasks such as\\nchanging a menu item\\'s name during runtime and disabling a menu item or entire\\nmenu.\\nTo offer the user a number of related options, create a single menu that allows\\nonly one item to be marked. Such a menu is said to be in radio mode, and places\\na checkmark beside the name of the most recently selected item. If these related\\nitems all form a subcategory of a topic that is itself a menu item, consider creating\\na submenu. A submenu is a menu item that, when selected, reveals still another\\nmenu. Another type of menu that typically holds numerous related options is a\\npop-up menu. A pop-up menu exists outside of a menubar, so it can be placed\\nanywhere in a window. You\\'ll find all the details of how to put a menu into radio\\nmode, create a submenu, and create a pop-up menu in this chapter.\\n\\nMenu Basics\\nA Be application can optionally include a menubar within any of its windows, as\\nshown in Figure 7-1. In this figure, a document window belonging to the\\n\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nStyledEdit program includes a menubar that holds four menus. As shown in the\\nFont menu, a menu can include nested menus (submenus) within it.\\n\\nFigure 7-1. An application window can have its own menubar\\n\\nMenus can be accessed via the keyboard rather than the mouse. To make the\\nmenubar the focus of keyboard keystrokes, the user presses both the Command\\nand Escape keys. Once the menubar is the target of keystrokes, the left and right\\narrow keys can be used to drop, or display, a menu. Once displayed, items in a\\nmenu can be highlighted using the up and down arrow keys. The Enter key\\nselects a highlighted item.\\nA second means of navigating menus and choosing menu items from the keyboard is through the use of triggers. One character in each menu name and in\\neach menu item name is underlined. This trigger character is used to access a\\nmenu or menu item. After making the menubar the focus of the keyboard, pressing a menu\\'s trigger character drops that menu. Pressing the trigger character of an\\nitem in that menu selects that item.\\nThe topics of menubars, menus, and menu items are intertwined in such a way\\nthat moving immediately into a detailed examination of each in turn doesn\\'t make\\nsense. Instead, it makes more sense to conduct a general discussion of menu\\nbasics: creating menu item, menu, and menubar objects, adding menu item objects\\nto a menu object, and adding a menu object to a menubar. That\\'s what takes place\\non the next several pages. Included are a couple of example projects that include\\nthe code to add a simple menubar to a window. With knowledge of the interrelationship of the various menu elements, and a look at the code that implements a\\nfunctional menubar with menus, it will be appropriate to move on to studies of\\nthe individual menu-related elements.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nAdding a Menubar to a Window\\nThe menubar, menu, and menu item are represented by objects of type BMenuBar,\\nBMenu, and BMenuItem, respectively. To add these menu-related elements to your\\nprogram, carry out the following steps:\\n1. Create a BMenuBar object to hold any number of menus.\\n2. Add the BMenuBar object to the window that is to display the menu.\\n3. For each menu that is to appear in the menubar:\\na. Create a BMenu object to hold any number of menu items.\\nb. Add the BMenu object to the menubar that is to hold the menu.\\nc. Create a BMenuItem object for each menu item that is to appear in the\\nmenu.\\nA menubar must be created before a menu can be added to it, and a menu must\\nbe created before a menu item can be added to it. However, the attaching of a\\nmenubar to a window and the attaching of a menu to a menubar needn\\'t follow\\nthe order shown in the above list. For instance, a menubar, menu, and several\\nmenu items could all be created before the menu is added to a menubar.\\n\\nWhen an example project in this book makes use of a menubar, its\\ncode follows the order given in the above list. It\\'s worth noting that\\nyou will encounter programs that do things differently. Go ahead\\nand rearrange the menu-related code in the MyHelloWindow constructor code in this chapter\\'s first example project to prove that it\\ndoesn\\'t matter when menu-related objects are added to parent\\nobjects.\\n\\nCreating a menubar\\nThe menubar is created through a call to the BMenuBar constructor. This routine\\naccepts two arguments: a BRect that defines the size and location of the menubar,\\nand a name for what will be the new BMenuBar object. Here\\'s an example:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\nBRect\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nmenuBarRect;\\n*menuBar;\\n\\n\\nmenuBarRect = Bounds();\\nmenuBarRect.bottom = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT;\\nmenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nConvention dictates that a menubar appear along the top of a window\\'s content\\narea. Thus, the menubar\\'s top left corner will be at point (0.0, 0.0) in window\\ncoordinates. The bottom of the rectangle defines the menu\\'s height, which is typically 18 pixels. Because a window\\'s menubar runs across the width of the window--regardless of the size of the window--the rectangle\\'s right boundary can be\\nset to the current width of the window the menubar is to reside in. The call to the\\nBWindow member function Bounds() does that. After that, the bottom of the rectangle needs to be set to the height of the menu (by convention it\\'s 18 pixels).\\nCreating a menubar object doesn\\'t automatically associate that object with a particular window object. To do that, call the window\\'s BWindow member function\\nAddChild(). Typically a window\\'s menubar will be created and added to the\\nwindow from within the window\\'s constructor. Carrying on with the above snippet, in such a case the menubar addition would look like this:\\nAddChild(menuBar);\\n\\nCreating a menu\\nCreating a new menu involves nothing more than passing the menu\\'s name to the\\nBMenu constructor. For many types of objects, the object name is used strictly for\\n\"behind-the-scenes\" purposes, such as in obtaining a reference to the object. A\\nBMenu object\\'s name is also used for that purpose, but it has a second use as\\nwell--it becomes the menu name that is displayed in the menubar to which the\\nmenu eventually gets attached. Here\\'s an example:\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\n\\nBecause one thinks of a menubar as being the organizer of its menus, it may be\\ncounterintuitive that the BMenuBar class is derived from the BMenu class--but\\nindeed it is. A menubar object can thus make use of any BMenu member function,\\nincluding the AddItem() function. Just ahead you will see how a menu object\\ninvokes AddItem() to add a menu item to itself. Here you see how a menubar\\nobject invokes AddItem() to add a menu to itself:\\nmenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\n\\nCreating a menu item\\nEach item in a menu is an object of type BMenuItem. The BMenuItem constructor\\nrequires two arguments: the menu item name as it is to appear listed in a menu,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nand a BMessage object. Here\\'s how a menu item to be used as an Open item in a\\nFile menu might be created:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\n\\nAdd the menu item to an existing menu by invoking the menu object\\'s BMenu\\nmember function AddItem(). Here menu is the BMenu object created in the previous section:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nWhile the above method of creating a menu item and adding it to a menu in two\\nsteps is perfectly acceptable, the steps are typically carried out in a single action:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG)));\\n\\nHandling a Menu Item Selection\\nHandling a menu item selection is so similar to handling a control click that if you\\nknow one technique, you know the other. You\\'re fresh from seeing the control\\n(you either read Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, before this chapter, or you just\\njumped back and read it now, right?), so a comparison of menu item handling to\\ncontrol handling will serve well to cement in your mind the practice used in each\\ncase: message creation and message handling.\\nIn Chapter 6, you read that to create a control, such as a button, you define a message constant and then use new along with the control\\'s constructor to allocate\\nboth the object and the model message--as in this snippet that creates a standard\\npush button labeled \"OK\":\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonOK;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, \"OKButton\",\\n\"OK\", new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nMenu item creation is similar: define a message constant and then create a menu\\nitem object:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nAn application-defined message is sent from the Application Server to a window.\\nThe window receives the message in its MessageReceived() function. So the\\nrecipient window\\'s BWindow-derived class must override MessageReceived()--\\nas demonstrated in Chapter 6 and again here:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\n...\\n...\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe implementation of MessageReceived() defines the action that occurs in\\nresponse to each application-defined message. You saw several examples of this\\nin Chapter 6, including a few projects that simply used beep() to respond to a\\nmessage. Here\\'s how MessageReceived() would be set up for a menu item message represented by a constant named MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\n// open a file;\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMenubar Example Project\\nThe SimpleMenuBar project generates a window that includes a menubar like the\\none in Figure 7-2. Here you see that the window\\'s menubar extends across the\\nwidth of the window, as expected, and holds a menu with a single menu item in\\nit. Choosing the Beep Once item from the Audio menu sounds the system beep.\\n\\nFigure 7-2. The SimpleMenuBar program\\'s window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nPreparing the window class for a menubar\\nIf a window is to let a user choose items from a menubar, its BWindow-derived\\nclass must override MessageReceived(). Additionally, you may opt to keep track\\nof the window\\'s menubar by including a BMenuBar data member in the class. You\\ncan also include BMenu and BMenuItem data members in the class declaration, but\\nkeeping track of the menubar alone is generally sufficient. As demonstrated later\\nin this chapter, it\\'s a trivial task to find any menu or menu item and get a reference to it by way of a menubar reference. Here\\'s how the window class header\\nfile (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this project) is set up for menu item handling:\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the menubar, menu, and menu item\\nBy default, the height of a menubar will be 18 pixels (though the system will automatically alter the menubar height to accommodate a large font that\\'s used to display menu names). So we\\'ll document the purpose of this number by defining a\\nconstant:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\n\\nAfter the constant definition comes the MyHelloWindow constructor. In past examples, the first three lines of this routine created a view that occupies the entire content area of the new window. This latest version of the constructor uses the same\\nthree lines, but also inserts one new line after the call to OffsetTo():\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe frame is the BRect that defines the size and screen location of the new window. Calling the BRect function OffsetTo() with an argument of B_ORIGIN\\nredefines the values of this rectangle\\'s boundaries so that the rectangle remains the\\nsame overall size, but has a top left corner at window coordinate (0.0, 0.0). That\\'s\\nperfect for use when placing a new view in the window. Here, however, I want\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\nthe view\\nthat will\\nheight of\\nrectangle\\n\\n\\nto start not at the window\\'s top left origin, but just below the menubar\\nsoon be created. Bumping the top of the frame rectangle down the\\nthe menu, plus one more pixel to avoid an overlap, properly sets up the\\nfor use in creating the view.\\n\\nIf you work on a project that adds a view and a menubar to a window, and mouse clicks on the menubar\\'s menus are ignored, the\\nproblem most likely concerns the view. It\\'s crucial to reposition a\\nwindow\\'s view so that it lies below the area that will eventually hold\\nthe menubar. If the view occupies the area that the menubar will\\nappear in, the menubar\\'s menus may not respond to mouse clicks.\\n(Whether a menu does or doesn\\'t respond will depend on the order\\nin which the view and menubar are added to the window.) If the\\nview overlaps the menubar, mouse clicks may end up directed at the\\nview rather than the menubar.\\n\\nThe menubar is created by defining the bar\\'s boundary and then creating a new\\nBMenuBar object. A call to the BWindow function AddChild() attaches the\\nmenubar to the window:\\nBRect\\n\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nmenuBarRect = Bounds();\\nmenuBarRect.bottom = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT;\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\n\\nThe menubar\\'s one menu is created using the BMenu constructor. A call to the\\nBMenu function AddItem() attaches the menu to the existing menubar:\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\n\\nA new menu is initially devoid of menu items. Calling the BMenu function\\nAddItem() adds one item to the menu:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\n\\nSubsequent calls to AddItem() append new items to the existing ones. Because\\nthe menu item won\\'t be referenced later in the routine, and as a matter of convenience, the creation of the new menu item object is done within the call to\\nAddItem(). We could expand the calls with no difference in the result. For\\ninstance, the above line of code could be written as follows:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(theItem);\\n\\nHere, in its entirety, is the MyHelloWindow constructor for the SimpleMenuBar\\nproject:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a menu item selection\\nTo respond to the user\\'s menu selection, all I did on this project was copy the\\nMessageReceived() function that handled a click on a control in a Chapter 6\\nexample project. The simplicity of this code sharing is further proof that a menu\\nitem selection is handled just like a control:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nWindow resizing and views\\nThe SimpleMenuBar example introduces one topic that\\'s only partially related to\\nmenus: how the resizing of a window affects a view attached to that window. A\\ntitled or document window (a window whose constructor contains a third parameter value of either B_TITLED_WINDOW or B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW) is by default resizable. (Recall that a BWindow constructor fourth parameter of B_NOT_RESIZABLE\\ncan alter this behavior.) The SimpleMenuBar window is resizable, so the behavior\\nof the views within the window isn\\'t static.\\nLike anything you draw, a menubar is a type of view. When a window that displays a menubar is resized, the length of the menubar is automatically altered to\\noccupy the width of the window. This is a feature of the menubar, not your application-defined code.\\nUnlike a menubar, a BView-derived class needs to specify the resizing behavior of\\nan instance of the class. This is done by supplying the appropriate Be-defined constant in the resizingMode parameter (the third parameter) to the BView constructor. In past examples, the B_FOLLOW_ALL constant was used for the\\nresizingMode:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe B_FOLLOW_ALL constant sets the view to be resized in conjunction with any\\nresizing that takes place in the view\\'s parent. If the view\\'s parent is the window\\n(technically, the window\\'s top view) and the window is enlarged, the view will be\\nenlarged proportionally. Likewise, if the window size is reduced, the view size is\\nreduced. As a window is resized, it requires constant updating--so the Draw()\\nfunction of each view in the window is repeatedly invoked. This may not always\\nbe desirable, as the SimpleMenuBar example demonstrates. This program\\'s window is filled with a view of the class MyDrawView. In this project, the Draw()\\nfunction for the MyDrawView class draws a rectangle around the frame of the\\nview:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nIf the MyDrawView view has a resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL, the result of\\nenlarging a window will be a number of framed rectangles in the window--one\\nrectangle for each automatic call that\\'s been made to Draw(). Figure 7-3 illustrates this.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-3. A view\\'s resizing mode needs to be coordinated with window resizing\\n\\nThe SimpleMenuBar project avoids the above phenomenon by using the\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE constant for the resizingMode:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThis constant sets the view to remain a fixed size and at a fixed location in its parent--regardless of what changes take place in the parent\\'s size. Figure 7-4 shows\\nhow the view in the SimpleMenuBar project\\'s window looks when the program\\'s\\nwindow is enlarged.\\n\\nFigure 7-4. A fixed-size view is unaffected by window resizing\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nMenubar and Control Example Project\\nNow that you know how to add controls and menus to a window, there\\'s a strong\\nlikelihood that you may want to include both within the same window. The\\nMenuAndControl project demonstrates how to do this. As Figure 7-5 shows, the\\nMenuAndControl program\\'s window includes the same menubar that was introduced in the previous example (the SimpleMenuBar project). Sounding the system beep is accomplished by either choosing the one menu item or by clicking on\\nthe button. The view, which in this program doesn\\'t occupy the entire window\\ncontent area, remains empty throughout the running of the program. Here the\\nview is used to elaborate on last section\\'s discussion of window resizing and\\nviews. In this chapter\\'s TwoMenus project, the view displays one of two drawings.\\n\\nFigure 7-5. The MenuAndControl application window\\n\\nPreparing the window class for a menubar and control\\nBoth the push button control and the one menu item require the definition of a\\nmessage constant:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\nTo handle messages from both the push button and the menu item, override\\nMessageReceived(). Data members for the control and menubar appear in the\\nBWindow-derived class as well:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBButton\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fButtonBeep;\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the menu-related elements and the control\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor begins with the customary creation of a view for\\nthe window. Here, however, the view doesn\\'t occupy the entire content area of\\nthe window. Recall that the SimpleMenuBar project set up the view\\'s area like this:\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\n\\nThe MenuAndControl project instead sets up the view\\'s area as follows:\\n\\nFigure 7-5 shows that the resulting view occupies the right side of the program\\'s\\nwindow. Since a view in past examples occupied the entire content area of a window, items were added to the view in order to place them properly. For instance,\\nif the MyHelloWindow defined a BButton data member named fButtonBeep and\\na MyDrawView data member named fMyView, the addition of the button to the\\nwindow would look like this:\\nfMyView->AddChild(fButtonBeep);\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class declared in the MenuAndControl project does in fact\\ninclude the two data members shown in the above line of code. This project\\'s\\nMyHelloWindow constructor, however, adds the button directly to the window\\nrather than to the window\\'s view. A call to the BButton function MakeDefault()\\nserves to outline the button:\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\nfButtonBeep->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nLooking back at Figure 7-5, you can see that in this project it wouldn\\'t make sense\\nto add the button to the window\\'s view. If I did that, the button would end up\\nbeing placed not on the left side of the window, but on the right side.\\nAfter adding the button to window, we create the menubar and add it to the window, create the menu and add it to the menubar, and create the menu item and\\nadd it to the menu. The menu-related code is identical to that used in the previous example (the SimpleMenuBar project). Note that there is no significance to my\\nplacing the control-related code before the menu-related code--the result is the\\nsame regardless of which component is added to the window first:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButtOnBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabEl, new BMessage(BUTTON_BEEP_MSG));\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\nfButtonBeep->MakeDefault(true);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a menu item selection and a control click\\nIt\\'s important to keep in mind that \"a message is a message\"--a window won\\'t distinguish between a message issued by a click on a control and a message generated by a menu item selection. So the same MessageReceived() function handles both message types:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nBecause a click on the Beep One button and a selection of the Beep Once menu\\nitem both result in the same action--a sounding of the system beep--I could have\\ndefined a single message constant. For instance, instead of defining both the\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG and the MENU_BEEP_1_MSG constants, I could have simply\\ndefined, say, a BEEP_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe One View Technique\\nNow you\\'ve seen numerous examples that establish one window-encompassing view, and one example that doesn\\'t. Which method should you use? Sorry,\\nbut the answer is an ambiguous \"It depends.\" It depends on whether your program will be making \"universal\" changes to a window, but it behooves you to\\nget in the habit of always including a window-filling view in each of your\\nBWindow-derived classes. If, much later in project development, you decide a\\nwindow needs to be capable of handling some all-encompassing change or\\nchanges, you can just issue appropriate calls to the view and keep changes to\\nyour project\\'s code to a minimum.\\nAs an example of a universal change to a window, consider a window that displays several controls and a couple of drawing areas. If for some reason all of\\nthese items need to be shifted within the window, it would make sense to have\\nall of the items attached to a view within the window rather than to the window itself. Then a call to the BView MoveBy() or MoveTo() member function\\neasily shifts the window\\'s one view, and its contents, within the window.\\nThe second reason to include a window-filling view--programmer\\'s preference--is related to the first reason. For each BWindow-derived class you define,\\nyou might prefer as a matter of habit to also define a BView-derived class:\\nclass MyFillView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nIf you have no immediate plans for the view, simply implement the view class\\nmember functions as empty:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n}\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n}\\n\\n--Continued--\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nIn the window\\'s constructor, create and add a view. Then add all of the window\\'s controls and other views to this main view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyFillView(frame, \"MyFillWindowView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fButton);\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nThe BButton constructor would then make use of this new message constant:\\nfButtonBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabel, new BMessage(BEEP_MSG));\\n\\nThe creation of the menu item makes use of this same message constant:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nA click on the button or a selection of the menu item would both result in the\\nsame type of message being sent to the window, so the MessageReceived()\\nfunction would now need only one case label:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThis scenario further demonstrates the notion that a window isn\\'t interested in the\\nsource of a message--it cares only about the type of the message (as defined by\\nthe message constant). That\\'s all well and good, but what\\'s the likelihood of a\\nreal-world application having a window that includes both a control and a menu\\nitem that produce the same action? Perhaps higher than you might guess. It\\'s a\\ncommon practice in many programs to include a control window (usually referred\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nto as a palette) that as a matter of convenience holds a number of buttons that\\nmimic the actions of commonly used menu items.\\nWindow resizing and the view hierarchy\\nThis chapter\\'s first example, the SimpleMenuBar project, illustrated how window\\nresizing affects a view. Including a control in the window of the MenuAndControl\\nproject provides an opportunity to illuminate resizing further.\\nA view created with a resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL is one that is resized\\nalong with its resized parent. A resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_NONE fixes a view in\\nits parent--even as the parent is resized. A view can also be kept fixed in size, but\\nmove within its parent. How it moves in relationship to the parent is dependent\\non which of the Be-defined constants B_FOLLOW_RIGHT, B_FOLLOW_LEFT, B_\\nFOLLOW_BOTTOM, or B_FOLLOW_TOP are used for the resizingMode. Each constant forces the view to keep its present distance from one parent view edge. Constants can also be used in combination with one another by using the OR operator (|). In the MenuAndControl project, the MyDrawView constructor combines B_\\nFOLLOW_RIGHT and B_FOLLOW_BOTTOM:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_RIGHT | B_FOLLOW_BOTTOM, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe result of this pairing of constants is a view that remains fixed to the parent\\nview\\'s (the window here) right and bottom. In Figure 7-6, the MenuAndControl\\nwindow\\'s size has been reduced horizontally and increased vertically, yet you see\\nthat the view has kept its original margin of about ten pixels from the window\\'s\\nright side and about ten pixels from the window\\'s bottom edge.\\n\\nFigure 7-6. A view that keeps a constant-size right and bottom border in its parent\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nA complete description of all the resizingMode constants is found\\nin the BView section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book.\\n\\nFigure 7-6 raises an interesting issue regarding the window\\'s view hierarchy. In the\\nfigure, you see that the view appears to be drawn behind the button. As of this\\nwriting, the view hierarchy determines the drawing order of the views in a\\nwindow. When a window requires updating, each view\\'s Draw() function is automatically invoked. The order in which the Draw() functions are called is first\\ndependent on the view hierarchy, starting from the window\\'s top view down to its\\nbottom views. For views on the same view hierarchy level, the order in which\\ntheir Draw() functions are invoked depends on the order in which the views were\\nadded, or attached, to their parent view. The first view added becomes the first\\nview redrawn. Such is the case with the BButton view and the MyDrawView. Each\\nwas added to the window, so these two views are at the same level of the view\\nhierarchy, just under the window\\'s top view. The MyDrawView was added first, so\\nit is updated first. After its Draw() function is called, the BButton Draw() routine\\nis called--thus giving the button the appearance of being in front of the\\nMyDrawView:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButtonBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_BEEP_MSG));\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nIf the order of the two calls to AddChild() were switched, you would expect the\\nbutton to be redrawn first, and the MyDrawView to be updated next. Give it a try\\nby editing the MyHelloWindow.cpp file of the MenuAndControl project. When you\\ndo that, you\\'ll see that running the program and shrinking the window results in\\nthe MyDrawView obscuring the button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nNotice that the discussion of view updating order starts of with \"As\\nof this writing...\". There is no guarantee that this order based on\\nview hierarchy will always be in effect. In short, don\\'t make assumptions about view updating order. Instead, make an effort not to overlap views.\\n\\nWorking with Menus\\nYour program can get by with simple, static menus and menu items--but why\\nstop there? The menubar, menus, and menu items of a program should reflect the\\ncurrent state of a program. You can make sure they do that by implementing\\nmenus so that they give the user visual cues as to what is being done, and what\\ncan and can\\'t be done. For instance, a menu item can be marked with a checkmark to let the user know the item is currently in force. Or a menu item\\'s name\\ncan be changed, if appropriate, to what is currently taking place in the program. A\\nmenu item--or an entire menu--can be disabled to prevent the user from attempting to perform some action that doesn\\'t make sense at that point in the program is\\nat. These and other menu-altering techniques are covered in this section.\\n\\nCreating a Menu Item\\nEach menu item in a menu is an object based on the BMenuItem class. Menu item\\nobjects were introduced earlier in this chapter--here they\\'re studied in much\\ngreater detail.\\nThe BMenuItem class\\nA menu item is created using the BMenuItem constructor, the prototype of which\\nis shown here:\\nBMenuItem(const char\\nBMessage\\nchar\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nshortcut = 0,\\nmodifiers = 0)\\n\\nThe first BMenuItem parameter, label, assigns the item its name, which is displayed as the item\\'s label when the user pulls down the menu in which the item\\nappears.\\nThe message parameter assigns a message of a particular type to the menu item.\\nWhen the user chooses the item, the message is delivered to the window\\nthat holds the menubar containing the menu item. That window\\'s\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nMessageReceived() function becomes responsible for carrying out the action\\nassociated with the menu item.\\nThe third BMenuItem constructor parameter, shortcut, is optional. The default\\nvalue used by the constructor is 0, but if a character is passed, that character\\nbecomes the menu item\\'s keyboard shortcut. When the user presses the shortcut\\nkey in conjunction with a modifier key, the menu item is considered selected--just\\nas if the user chose it from the menu. The fourth parameter, modifiers, specifies\\nwhat key is considered the modifier key. A keyboard shortcut must include the\\nCommand key (which by default is the Alt key on a PC and the Command key on\\na Macintosh) as its modifier key, but it can also require that one or more other\\nmodifier keys be pressed in order to activate the keyboard shortcut. Any of the Bedefined modifier key constants, including B_COMMAND_KEY, B_SHIFT_KEY,\\nB_OPTION_KEY, and B_CONTROL, can be used as the modifiers parameter. For\\ninstance, to designate that a key combination of Command-Q represent a means of\\nactivating a Quit menu item, pass \\'Q\\' as the shortcut parameter and B_COMMAND_\\nKEY as the modifiers parameter. To designate that a key combination of Alt-Shift-W\\n(on a PC) or Command-Shift-W (on a Mac) represents a means of closing all open\\nwindows, pass \\'W\\' as the shortcut parameter, and the ored constants\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY as the modifiers parameter.\\nCreating a BMenuItem object\\nA menu item is often created and added to a menu in one step by invoking the\\nBMenuItem constructor from right within the parameter list of a call to the BMenu\\nfunction AddItem():\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG)));\\n\\nAlternatively, a menu item can be created and then added to a menu in a separate\\nstep:\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nRegardless of the method used, to this point the BMenuItem constructor has been\\npassed only two arguments. To assign a keyboard shortcut to a menu item,\\ninclude arguments for the optional third and fourth parameters. Here a menu item\\nnamed \"Start\" is being given the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-S (with the\\nassumption that the slightly more intuitive keyboard shortcut Command-S is perhaps already being used for a \"Save\" menu item):\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG), \\'S\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY));\\n\\nIf a menu item is associated with a keyboard shortcut, and if that shortcut uses a\\nmodifier key, a symbol for that modifier key appears to the right of the menu item.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe symbol provides the user with an indication of what key should be pressed in\\nconjunction with the character key that follows the symbol. Figure 7-7 provides\\nseveral examples. In that figure, I\\'ve set up a menu with four items. The name I\\'ve\\ngiven each item reflects the modifier key or keys that need to be pressed in order\\nto select the item. For instance, the first menu item is selected by pressing Command-A. This next snippet provides the code necessary to set up the menu shown\\nin Figure 7-7:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command\", new BMessage(A_MSG), \\'A\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift\", new BMessage(B_MSG), \\'B\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift-Option\", new BMessage(C_MSG), \\'C\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY | B_OPTION_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift-Option-Control\",\\nnew BMessage(D_MSG), \\'D\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY |\\nB_OPTION_KEY | B_CONTROL_KEY));\\n\\nFigure 7-7. A menu that includes items that use several shortcut modifier keys\\n\\nAs illustrated in the preceding snippet and Figure 7-7, menu items are displayed in\\na menu in the order in which they were added to the BMenu object. To reposition\\nitems, simply rearrange the order of the calls to AddItem().\\nA separator is a special menu item that is nothing more than an inactive gray line.\\nIt exists only to provide the user with a visual cue that some items in a menu are\\nlogically related, and are thus grouped together. To add a separator item, invoke\\nthe BMenu function AddSeparatorItem():\\nmenu->AddSeparatorItem();\\n\\nFigure 7-15, later in this chapter, includes a menu that has a separator item.\\n\\nAccessing a Menu Item\\nIf a program is to make a change to a menu item, it of course needs access to the\\nitem. That can be accomplished by storing either the BMenuItem object or the\\nBMenuBar object as a data member.\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nStoring a menu item in a data member\\nIf you need access to a menu item after it is created, just store it in a local variable:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nThis snippet creates a menu item and adds it to a menu--as several previous\\nexamples have done. Here, though, the menu item object created by the\\nBMenuItem constructor is assigned to the BMenuItem variable menuItem. Now the\\nproject has access to this one menu item in the form of the menuItem variable.\\nThis menu item access technique is of limited use. Access to a menu item may\\nneed to take place outside of the function which created the menu item. If that\\'s\\nthe case, a window class data member can be created to keep track of an item for\\nthe life of the window:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*fMenuItem;\\n\\n};\\n\\nNow, when the menu item is created, store a reference to it in the fMenuItem\\ndata member:\\nmenu->AddItem(fMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nUsing this technique for creating the menu item, the menu item can be accessed\\nfrom any member function of the window class.\\nStoring a menubar in a data member\\nIf several menu items are to be manipulated during the running of a program, it\\nmay make more sense to keep track of just the menubar rather than each individual menu item:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIf the menubar can be referenced, the BMenu member function FindItem() can\\nbe used to access any menu item in any of its menus. Pass FindItem() a menu\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nlabel (the string that represents the menu item name that is displayed to the user),\\nand the function returns that menu item\\'s BMenuItem object:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Beep\");\\n\\nMarking Menu Items\\nWhen selected, a menu item can be given a check mark to the left of the item\\nname. When selected again, this same menu item can become unchecked.\\nFigure 7-8 shows a menu with two marked items.\\n\\nFigure 7-8. A menu with marked, or checked, menu items\\n\\nMarking a menu item\\nTo mark or unmark a menu item, invoke the item\\'s BMenuItem function\\nSetMarked(). Passing this function a value of true marks the item, while passing a value of false unmarks it. Attempting to mark an already marked item or\\nunmark an already unmarked item has no effect. This next snippet sets up the\\nWindows menu items shown in Figure 7-8. Assume that data members exist to\\nkeep track of each of the three Windows menu items, and that the menubar and\\nmenu have already been created:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\nmenu->AddItem(fLockWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Lock Control Window\",\\nnew BMessage(LOCK_WIND_MSG)));\\nfLockWindMenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->AddItem(fResizeWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Allow Window Resizing\",\\nnew BMessage(RESIZE_WIND_MSG)));\\nfResizeWindMenuItem ->SetMarked(true)\\nmenu->AddItem(fMultipleWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Allow Multiple Windows\",\\nnew BMessage(MULTIPLE_WIND_MSG)));\\n\\nIf a menu item is to be initially marked (as the Lock Control Window and Allow\\nWindow Resizing items are in the above snippet), save a reference to the item\\nwhen creating it. Then use that BMenuItem object to mark the item.\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nTo find out whether a menu item is marked, call the BMenuItem function\\nIsMarked(). For instance, after the user selects a menu item, call IsMarked() to\\ndetermine whether to pass SetMarked() a value of true or false and thus toggle the menu\\'s mark. The updating of an item\\'s mark can take place in the\\nMessageReceived() function, as shown here for the first menu item from the\\nWindows menu of Figure 7-8:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase LOCK_WIND_MSG:\\nBMenuItem *theItem;\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Lock Control Window\");\\nif (theItem->IsMarked()) {\\ntheItem->SetMarked(false);\\n// code to unlock a window (allow user to move it)\\n}\\nelse {\\ntheItem->SetMarked(true);\\n// code to lock a window (prevent user from moving it)\\n}\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMarking a menu item in a menu of related items\\nA menu may treat all of its items as related options, with the intent of allowing\\nonly one item to be in force at any time. The Audio menu in Figure 7-9 provides\\nan example of such a menu. Here the user is expected to choose one of the two\\nbeeping options. A subsequent click on the Beep button sounds the system beep\\neither once or twice, depending on the currently selected menu item.\\n\\nFigure 7-9. A menu with related options\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nIf all of the items in a menu are to act as a single set of options, you can set up\\nthe menu to automatically handle the checking and unchecking of its items. The\\nBMenu function SetRadioMode() instructs a menu to allow only one of its items\\nto be marked at any time. Additionally, setting a menu to radio mode provides the\\nmenu with the power to automatically mark whatever item the user chooses, and\\nto unmark the previously selected item. To set a menu to radio mode, pass\\nSetRadioMode() a value of true. This next snippet sets up the Audio menu pictured in Figure 7-9, marks the Beep Twice item, and sets the Audio menu to radio\\nmode:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\",\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\n\\nWhile a menu in radio mode will properly update its item mark in response to\\nmenu item selections, it is your responsibility to check which item is to be initially\\nmarked. As shown above, that\\'s accomplished via a call to SetMarked(). If a\\nmenu item is checked, your code should also make sure that the feature or option\\nto be set is in fact set.\\nThe BMenu function FindMarked() returns the menu item object of the currently\\nmarked item in a menu. When a menu is in radio mode, only one item can be\\nmarked at any time. In the next snippet, the Audio menu shown in Figure 7-9 is\\nkept track of by a BMenu data member named fAudioMenu. Calling\\nFindMarked() on this item returns the BMenuItem object of the currently marked\\nitem:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fAudioMenu->FindMarked();\\n\\nFindMarked() can be used on a menu that isn\\'t set to radio mode, too--but its\\nusefulness is then diminished because there may be more than one item marked.\\nIf more than one item is marked, FindMarked() returns a reference to the first\\nmarked item encountered (it starts at the first item in a menu and moves down).\\n\\nChanging a Menu Item\\'s Label\\nA menu item\\'s label can be changed at any time. To do that, gain access to the\\nmenu item and then invoke the BMenuItem function SetLabel(). In the next\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nsnippet, a menu item named \"Start Simulation\" is being renamed to \"Stop Simulation.\"\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Stop Simulation\");\\n\\nTo find out the current label of a menu item, call the BMenuItem function\\nLabel(). A call to this routine can be made prior to a call to SetLabel() to\\ndetermine the item\\'s current label before changing it to a new string. The type of\\nlabel-changing shown in the above snippet is a good candidate for the use of both\\nLabel() and SetLabel(). If the user starts some sort of action by choosing a\\nmenu item, that menu item\\'s label might change in order to provide the user with\\na means of stopping the action. The MessageReceived() function holds the\\nlabel-changing code:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_SIMULATION_RUN_MSG:\\nconst char *menuItemLabel;\\nmenuItemLabel = fSimMenuItem->Label();\\nif ((strcmp(menuItemLabel, \"Start Simulation\") == 0)) {\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Stop Simulation\");\\n// invoke application-defined routine to start simulation\\n}\\nelse {\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Start Simulation\");\\n// invoke application-defined routine to stop simulation\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThis snippet is the first in this book to make use of a standard C library function.\\nWhile the member functions of the classes of the BeOS take care of many of your\\nprogramming needs, they of course can\\'t account for every task your program is to\\nperform. Before writing an application-defined routine, don\\'t forget to fall back on\\nyour C and C++ background to select a standard library function where appropriate. Here I use the string comparison routine strcmp() to compare the characters\\nin a menu item\\'s label to the string \"Start Simulation.\" If the strings are identical,\\nstrcmp() returns a value of 0. In such a case, the menu item label needs to be\\nchanged to signal that the simulation is running and to allow the user to halt the\\naction. As shown in the two comments in the above code, whatever it is that is to\\nbe simulated is left as an exercise for the reader!\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nDisabling and Enabling Menus and Menu Items\\nWhen a menu is created, the menu and each of its items are all initially enabled.\\nThe entire menu--including the menu\\'s name in the menubar and all its items--or\\nany individual menu item can be disabled.\\nDisabling and enabling a menu item\\nA disabled menu item appears dim and is inactive--the user can see the item and\\nread its label, but can\\'t select it (releasing the mouse button while the cursor is\\nover the item has no effect). A menu item can be disabled or re-enabled by invoking the BMenuItem member function SetEnabled(). An argument of true\\nenables the item, while an argument of false disables the item. By default, a\\nmenu item is enabled upon creation. To disable a newly created menu item, call\\nSetEnabled() just after the menu item is created. Assuming that the menu\\'s window keeps track of its menubar in a data member named fMenuBar, the following snippet could be used to disable a menu item named \"Start\":\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Start\");\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nThe current state of a menu item can be found by invoking the item\\'s\\nIsEnabled() function. This routine returns a value of true if the item is presently enabled, false if it\\'s disabled.\\nIf the enabling or disabling of a menu item is to take place in response to a message (whether initiated by a different menu item selection or a control click),\\ninclude the menu item enabling/disabling code in MessageReceived(). Here a\\nmenu item named Advanced Options is enabled or disabled in response to an\\napplication-defined TOGGLE_OPTIONS_MSG message:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase TOGGLE_OPTIONS_MSG:\\nBMenuItem *theItem;\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Advanced Options\");\\nif (theItem->IsEnabled())\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\nelse\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(true);\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when SetEnabled() or IsEnabled() is invoked\\ndepends on the state of the menu the item resides in. If the menu\\nitself is disabled, attempting to enable an individual item in that\\nmenu will fail. Thus, even if your code hasn\\'t explicitly disabled a\\nspecific menu item, IsEnabled() could return a value of false for\\nthat item.\\n\\nDisabling and enabling a menu\\nWhen an entire menu is disabled, its name appears dim in the menubar. Clicking\\non the menu opens the menu and displays its items, but each of the items will be\\ndisabled. Now that you know of the BMenuItem() function SetEnabled(), it\\nshould come as no surprise that there is also a BMenu version of this routine. Passing a value of false to a menu object\\'s SetEnabled() function disables the\\nentire menu. If a program keeps track of an Audio menu in a BMenu data member\\nnamed fAudioMenu, you could disable that menu with just this line of code:\\nfAudioMenu->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nThe current state of a menu can be found by invoking the item\\'s IsEnabled()\\nfunction. Like the BMenuItem version, the BMenu version of this routine returns a\\nvalue of true if the object is presently enabled.\\nA menu\\'s state usually changes in response to a message. If that\\'s the case, include\\nthe menu enabling or disabling code in MessageReceived().\\n\\nMenu and Menu Item Keyboard Access\\nMenu items can be accessed by the mouse, of course, but they can also be\\naccessed from the keyboard.\\nShortcut keys\\nThis chapter\\'s \"Creating a Menu Item\" section demonstrated how to assign a new\\nBMenuItem a keyboard shortcut. Here the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBMenuItem constructor set the new menu item to have a keyboard shortcut of\\nCommand-M:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command\", new BMessage(A_MSG), \\'M\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY));\\n\\nIn most instances the above method works fine for establishing a keyboard shortcut. However, your program may want to assign a keyboard shortcut on the fly.\\nThis is particularly true if your program gives the user the power to modify menu\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nitem keyboard shortcuts. If an existing menu item doesn\\'t have a keyboard shortcut, or your program needs to change its currently defined keyboard shortcut,\\ninvoke the item\\'s SetShortcut() function. The two arguments to this routine are\\nidentical to the third and fourth arguments that can be passed to the BMenuItem\\nconstructor. Here the keyboard shortcut for an Open menu item is being set to\\nCommand-Shift-O:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Open\");\\ntheItem->SetShortcut(\\'O\\', B_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY)\\n\\nTo determine the current keyboard shortcut of a menu item, invoke the item\\'s\\nShortcut() function. Pass this function a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer\\nvariable. Shortcut() will fill this variable with a mask that consists of all of the\\nmodifier keys that are a part of the shortcut for the menu item. Shortcut() will\\nalso return the shortcut character for the menu item:\\nchar\\n\\n*shortcutModifiers;\\nshortcutChar;\\n\\nshortcutChar = theItem->Shortcut(shortcutModifiers);\\n\\nTo determine which modifier key or keys are a part of the shortcut, perform a bitwise AND on the uint32 parameter. In the next snippet, a menu item named Calculate is examined to determine its shortcut key. If the character returned by\\nShortcut() is null, the item has no shortcut key. If the menu item does have a\\nshortcut, the code goes on to determine which modifier keys are involved.\\nBecause all shortcut key combinations must include the Command key, no check\\nis made to see if that key is a modifier. The code does, however, check to see if\\nthe Shift or Option keys are included in the shortcut key combination:\\nBMenuItem\\nchar\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\n*theItem;\\n*shortcutModifiers;\\nshortcutChar;\\nhasShortcut = true;\\nshiftKeyModifier = false;\\noptionKeyModifier = false;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Calculate\");\\nshortcutChar = theItem->Shortcut(shortcutModifiers);\\nif (shortcutChar == \\'\\\\0\\')\\n// menu item doesn\\'t have a shortcut key\\nhasShortcut = false;\\nelse {\\n// menu item has a shortcut key\\nif (*shortcutModifiers & B_SHIFT_KEY)\\nshiftKeyModifier = true;\\nif (*shortcutModifiers & B_OPTION_KEY)\\noptionKeyModifier = true;\\n}\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nKeyboard triggers\\nA menu item can optionally be supplied with a shortcut key to benefit users who\\nprefer the keyboard over the mouse. But every menu item is supplied with a trigger for the same reason. A trigger is a single character the user types in order to\\nselect a menu item. A trigger differs from a shortcut key in two ways. First, the\\ntrigger doesn\\'t involve the use of a modifier key--simply pressing the trigger key\\nis enough to choose the menu item. The second difference is that the trigger\\nworks only when the menu that holds the item in question is open, or dropped.\\nOnce a menu is open onscreen, the user can simply press a trigger key to select\\nan item.\\nThe trigger is one of the characters in the menu item name, and is indicated by\\nbeing underlined. Typically, the trigger is the first character of one of the words\\nthat make up the menu item\\'s name. Looking back at Figure 7-9 reveals two examples--there you see that the Audio menu\\'s two items, Beep Once and Beep Twice,\\nhave triggers of \"O\" and \"T,\" respectively.\\nBecause a trigger can be used only on an open menu, different menus in the same\\nmenubar can have items with the same trigger. A menu item\\'s trigger is assigned\\nto the item by the system, so your program doesn\\'t have to worry about which\\nitems end up with which triggers. If you do want responsibility for assigning a\\nmenu item a particular trigger, invoke that item\\'s SetTrigger() function. Simply\\npass SetTrigger() the character that is to serve as the new trigger. Here a menu\\nitem named Jump is given a trigger of \"u\":\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Jump\");\\ntheItem->SetTrigger(\\'u\\');\\n\\nThe character you pass to SetTrigger() must be either the menu item\\'s shortcut\\nkey or a character in the menu item name. Failing both of these, the item will not\\nbe given a trigger--and whatever character had previously been assigned to the\\nitem won\\'t be used either (so passing SetTrigger() an invalid character provides the exception to the rule that every menu item must have a trigger).\\nYou can verify that a call to SetTrigger() worked according to plan by invoking the item\\'s Trigger() function. Double-check to see if the above snippet\\nworks by following it with a call to Trigger():\\nchar\\n\\ntheTrigger;\\n\\ntheTrigger = theItem->Trigger();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nWith the exception of a menu item that\\'s been given a trigger via a\\ncall to SetTrigger(), the system doesn\\'t assign menu items triggers until runtime. That\\'s done to avoid duplication of triggers within\\na menu. For this reason, calling Trigger() on a menu item that\\nhasn\\'t been manually assigned a trigger (by your project invoking\\nthe item\\'s SetTrigger() function) serves little purpose--\\nTrigger() will simply return NULL in such cases.\\n\\nFigure 7-9 shows that the menu itself has a trigger--the \"A\" key serves as the trigger for the Audio menu. Like a menu item trigger, the system automatically assigns\\na trigger to a menu. Again like a menu item, your project can override the systemsupplied trigger character. To do that, invoke the BMenu version of SetTrigger()\\non a menu object. Here the Audio menu is created and its trigger set to \"U\":\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\n...\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->SetTrigger(\\'U\\');\\n// now add menu items to menu\\n\\nMenu Characteristics Example Projects\\nIn this chapter\\'s example projects folder you\\'ll find three projects that alter the\\ncharacteristics of menus: TwoItemMenu, DisableMenuItem, and FindItemByMark.\\nEach contains only a few lines of new code, so I\\'ll forego thorough code walkthroughs and describe each only briefly.\\nAdding and altering menu items example project\\nThe menu in each of this chapter\\'s previous example projects consisted of just a\\nsingle item. The TwoItemMenu project adds a second item. This project also adds\\na shortcut key to each item--Command-1 for the Beep Once item and Command-2\\nfor the Beep Twice item. Figure 7-10 shows that the system has assigned each item\\na trigger that is the same character as that used in the item\\'s shortcut key. Finally,\\nthe project demonstrates a menu set to radio mode--selecting one menu item\\nchecks that item and unchecks the other item.\\nMost of the code included in the TwoMenuItem project will be quite familiar to\\nyou. The code that\\'s pertinent to the menu item topics in this section comes from\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-10. Menu items with shortcut keys\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG),\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\n\\nMenu item disabling and enabling example project\\nThe DisableMenuItem project adds a few lines of code to the TwoMenuItem\\nproject to demonstrate how your program can toggle a menu item\\'s state based on\\na message sent by a control. Clicking on the Beep button disables the Beep Once\\nmenu item in the Audio menu. Clicking on the Beep button again enables the\\nsame item. This menu-related code is found in the MessageReceived() case section for the message issued by the button control:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\n// code to beep the appropriate number of times goes here\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Beep Once\");\\nif (theItem->IsEnabled())\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\nelse\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(true);\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nAccessing a menu item from a menu object\\nThe preceding two projects use a MyHelloWindow class data member named\\nfNumBeeps to keep track of how many times the system beep should sound in\\nresponse to a click on the Beep button. The FindItemByMark project omits this\\ndata member, and doesn\\'t keep track of which menu item is currently selected.\\nInstead, it waits until the user clicks the Beep button before determining which\\nmenu item is currently marked. Clicking the Beep button results in the issuing of a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG that reaches the MessageReceived() function. Here the\\nBMenu member function FindMarked() is used to find the currently checked\\nmenu item. Once the item object is obtained, its place in the menu is found by\\ncalling the BMenu function IndexOf(). A menu\\'s items are indexed starting at 0,\\nso adding 1 to the value returned by IndexOf() provides the number of beeps to\\nplay. The following snippet is from the MessageReceived() function of the\\nproject\\'s MyHelloWindow class:\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000;\\ni;\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n// one second\\n\\n*theItem;\\nitemIndex;\\nnumBeeps;\\n\\ntheItem = fAudioMenu->FindMarked();\\nitemIndex = fAudioMenu->IndexOf(theItem);\\nnumBeeps = itemIndex + 1;\\nfor (i = 1; i <= numBeeps; i++)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nif (i != numBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nMultiple Menus\\nRather than jumping right into new topics, I\\'ll provide a bit of a transition by presenting an example that includes two menus in its menubar. The example isn\\'t\\nentirely gratuitous, though--much of its code will reappear in upcoming discus-\\n\\x0cMultiple Menus\\n\\n\\nsions. Figure 7-11 shows the window, and the new Visual menu that\\'s been added\\nto the existing Audio menu, for the TwoMenus program. Choosing Draw Circles\\nfrom the Visual menu draws a number of concentric circles in the window, while\\nDraw Squares draws, yes, a number of concentric squares!\\n\\nFigure 7-11. The TwoMenus application window\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file in the TwoMenus project defines five message\\nconstants--one for the window\\'s button and one for each of the four menu items.\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG\\nMENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG\\nMENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\'circ\\'\\n\\'squa\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class holds four data members. fMyView is used for drawing\\nthe circles or squares, and fNumBeeps holds the number of times the system beep\\nis to be played when the Beep button is clicked. Once the button and menubar\\nare created, they aren\\'t accessed outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor. Thus,\\nI could have declared BButton and BMenuBar variables local to that routine rather\\nthan making each a data member. However, I\\'ve opted to set the project up from\\nthe start with the assumption that it will grow in complexity well beyond this trivial version. If I later need to add features that alter either the button or menu items\\n(such as disabling and so forth), I\\'m all set.\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fButtonBeep;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nSome of the MyHelloWindow constructor code is familiar to you, so I won\\'t show\\nthe routine in its entirety. Here\\'s the constructor without the view and button\\ncode:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\n...\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\nBRect\\nmenuBarRect;\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\",\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Visual\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MessageReceived() routine handles each of the five types of messages the\\nwindow might receive. A selection of either of the items from the Visual menu\\nresults in the application-defined function SetViewPicture() being called, followed by a call to the BView routine Invalidate() to force the view to update.\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\n// beep fNumBeeps times\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\n\\x0cMultiple Menus\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_CIRCLES);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_SQUARES);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe drawing code could have been kept in the MessageReceived() function, but\\nI\\'ve decided to place it in a MyDrawView member function in order to keep\\nMessageReceived() streamlined. The SetViewPicture() function defines a\\nBPicture object based on the int32 argument passed to the routine. The value\\nof that argument is in turn based on the menu item selected by the user:\\nvoid MyDrawView::SetViewPicture(int32 pictureNum)\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nswitch (pictureNum)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_SQUARES:\\nBeginPicture(fPicture);\\nfor (i = 0; i < 30; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\nbreak;\\ncase PICTURE_CIRCLES:\\nBeginPicture(fPicture);\\nfor (i = 0; i < 30; i++) {\\nStrokeEllipse(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe picture defined in SetViewPicture() is a new data member that\\'s been\\nadded to the MyDrawView class. Here you see the BPicture data member and the\\nnewly added declaration of the SetViewPicture() function:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_SQUARES\\nPICTURE_CIRCLES\\n\\n\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nBPicture\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPicture;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe whole purpose of storing the circles or squares BPicture object in a\\nMyDrawView data member is so that the picture will be automatically updated\\nwhenever the view it\\'s drawn in needs updating. That\\'s accomplished by adding a\\ncall to the BView function DrawPicture() to the MyDrawView member function\\nDraw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\nDrawPicture(fPicture);\\n}\\n\\nPop-up Menus\\nA pop-up menu is a menu that exists within the content area of a window rather\\nthan within a menubar. The pop-up menu can be positioned anywhere in a window (or anywhere in a view in a window). Like a menu in a menubar, a pop-up\\nmenu\\'s content is displayed when the user clicks on the menu. Figure 7-12 shows\\na pop-up menu, both before and after being clicked, that holds two items.\\n\\nFigure 7-12. An example of a pop-up menu\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nA pop-up menu\\'s default state is radio mode--the most recently selected item in\\nthe menu appears checked when the menu pops up. Figure 7-12 illustrates this for\\na menu with two items in it. A pop-up menu is most often in radio mode, so such\\na menu should be used to hold a related set of options. If the menu is to hold\\nitems that aren\\'t directly related to one another, the menu should be housed\\nwithin a menubar rather than existing as a pop-up menu. A context-sensitive popup menu is an exception--it behaves like a normal menu, albeit one that is not\\ntied to a specific location in a window.\\n\\nThe BPopUpMenu Class\\nA pop-up menu is an object of the class BPopUpMenu. The BPopUpMenu class is\\nderived from a class you\\'ve already studied--the BMenu class. Here\\'s the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor:\\nBPopUpMenu(const char\\nbool\\nbool\\nmenu_layout\\n\\n*name,\\nradioMode = true,\\nlabelFromMarked = true,\\nlayout = B_ITEMS_IN_COLUMN)\\n\\nLike any menu, a pop-up menu has a name. The name is defined by the first\\nBPopUpMenu constructor parameter and is present on the pop-up menu when the\\nmenu initially appears in a window. This pop-up menu name, however, can be\\nchanged to reflect the user\\'s selection from the menu. The labelFromMarked\\nparameter determines if that is to be the case.\\nThe value of the radioMode parameter sets the pop-up menu\\'s radio mode setting. By default, radioMode has a value of true. A value of true here means the\\nsame as it does for any other menu: choosing one item checks that item and\\nunchecks whatever item was previously selected. The pop-up menu\\'s radio mode\\nvalue can be toggled by calling the BMenu function SetRadioMode().\\nIf the labelFromMarked parameter is set to true--as it is by default--the user\\'s\\nmenu item choice from the pop-up menu determines the name the pop-up menu\\ntakes on. The original name won\\'t reappear during the life of the window to\\nwhich the pop up is attached. In Figure 7-12, for instance, the pop-up menu\\'s\\nname is Visual. If the user chooses, say, the Draw Squares item, the pop-up\\nmenu\\'s name will change to Draw Squares. Setting labelFromMarked to true has\\nthe interesting side effect of automatically setting the pop-up menu to radio mode.\\nThat is, regardless of the value passed as the radioMode parameter of the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor, the menu will be set to radio mode. If\\nlabelFromMarked is false, the pop-up menu\\'s name will be fixed at its initial\\nname (as defined by the value passed in as the first parameter) and its radio mode\\nstate will be determined by the value of the radioMode parameter.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe last BPopUpMenu parameter defines the layout of the pop-up menu. By\\ndefault, a pop-up menu\\'s items appear in a column--just like a menu held in a\\nmenubar. To instead have the items appear in a row, replace the B_ITEMS_IN_\\nCOLUMN value with another Be-defined constant: B_ITEMS_IN_ROW.\\n\\nThe BMenuField Class\\nA pop-up menu won\\'t be placed in a menubar, so it doesn\\'t have to be added to a\\nBMenuBar object. A pop-up menu does, however, need to be added to an object\\ncapable of controlling the menu. The BMenuField class exists for this purpose.\\nWhen a BMenuField object is created, a BPopUpMenu object is associated with it.\\nHere\\'s the BMenuField constructor:\\nBMenuField(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMenu\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*menu,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BMenuField is derived from the BView class. When a BMenuField object is\\ncreated, four of the six BMenuField constructor parameters (frame, name,\\nresizingMode, and flags) are passed on to the BView constructor.\\nThe frame is a rectangle that defines the size of the BMenuField, which includes\\nboth a label and a pop-up menu. In Figure 7-12, you saw an example of a\\nBMenuField object that has a label of \"Drawing:\" and a menu with the name\\n\"Visual.\" Recall that the source of the menu\\'s name is the name parameter of the\\nBPopUpMenu object. The BMenuField name parameter serves as a name for the\\nBMenuField view, and isn\\'t displayed onscreen. The resizingMode parameter\\nspecifies how the BMenuField is to be resized as its parent view is resized. The\\ndefault value of B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP means that the distance from\\nthe menu field\\'s left side and its parent\\'s parent\\'s left side will be fixed, as will the\\ndistance from the menu field\\'s top and its parent\\'s top. The flags parameter specifies the notification the menu field is to receive. The default flags value of\\nB_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE means that the menu field view contains drawing, and should thus be subject to automatic updates, and that the menu field is\\ncapable of receiving and responding to keyboard input.\\nThe BMenuField label parameter defines an optional label for the menu field. If\\nyou pass a string here, that string is displayed to the left of the pop-up menu that\\nis a part of the menu field. To omit a label, pass NULL as the label parameter.\\nThe menu parameter specifies the pop-up menu that is to be controlled by the\\nmenu field. While the class specified is BMenu, it is most likely that you\\'ll pass a\\nBPopUpMenu object here (BPopUpMenu is derived from BMenu, so it can be used).\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nCreating a Pop-up Menu\\nTo create a pop-up menu, you first create a BPopUpMenu object, and then create a\\nBMenuField object. Three of the four BPopUpMenu constructor parameters have\\ndefault values, and those values generally suffice when creating a pop-up menu\\nobject--so creating the BPopUpMenu object often involves passing only a single\\nargument to the BPopUpMenu constructor. Here a BPopUpMenu object for a pop-up\\nmenu named \"Visual\" is being created:\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\n*popUpMenu;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Visual\");\\n\\nFor a \"regular\" menu--one that resides in a menubar--the next step would typically be to add the new menu object to the existing menubar object with a call to\\nAddItem(). A pop-up menu won\\'t be placed in a menubar, so the above step is\\nunnecessary. The pop-up menu does, however, need to be added to a menu field.\\nThe next steps are to create a BMenuField object that incorporates the\\nBPopUpMenu object and then add this new menu field to a view (or window):\\nBMenuField\\nBRect\\n\\n*menuField;\\n\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"VisualPopUp\", \"Drawing\",\\npopUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\n\\nThe third argument to the BMenuField constructor specifies that the menu field\\nhave a label of \"Drawing.\" In the previous snippet, the sole argument to the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor specified that the pop-up menu have the name \"Visual.\"\\nThe result of executing the above two snippets would be the menu field shown\\non the left side of Figure 7-12. The pop-up menu would be devoid of any items.\\nTo add a menu item to a pop up, have the pop-up menu invoke the BMenu function AddItem(). BPopUpMenu is derived from BMenu, and BPopUpMenu doesn\\'t\\noverride the BMenu version of AddItem()--so adding menu items to a pop-up\\nmenu is handled in the exact same way as adding menu items to a \"normal\" menu\\nthat resides in a menubar. Here two items are added to the pop-up menu that was\\njust created:\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\n\\nAt this point the menu field, and the pop-up menu that is a part of the menu field,\\nmatch those shown on the right of Figure 7-12.\\nOne reason the menu field label exists is to provide the user with information\\nregarding the purpose of the menu field\\'s pop-up menu. Once the user chooses\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nan item from the pop-up menu, the pop-up menu\\'s name disappears, so the menu\\nfield label may then be of help. If the contents of the pop-up menu make the popup menu\\'s purpose obvious, you may choose to forego the menu field label. To\\ndo that, simply pass NULL as the third argument to the BMenuField constructor.\\nCompare this BMenuField object creation with the one created a couple of snippets back:\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"VisualPopUp\", NULL, popUpMenu);\\n\\nThe left side of Figure 7-13 shows how the menu field looks now. The middle part\\nof the figure shows a menu item selection being made, while the right side of the\\nfigure shows how the menu field looks after choosing an item.\\n\\nFigure 7-13. A menu field before, during, and after a menu item selection\\n\\nYou\\'ll find the code that generates the window shown in Figure 7-13 in the\\nMenuAndPopup project. The code varies little from that shown in the coverage of\\nthis chapter\\'s TwoMenus project. But the MyHelloWindow constructors are different. The MenuAndPopup project uses the following code for adding a second\\nmenu to the menubar:\\nBMenuField\\nBPopUpMenu\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\n\\n*menuField;\\n*popUpMenu;\\n*popUpName = \"VisualPopUp\";\\n*popUpLabel = NULL;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Visual\");\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, popUpName, popUpLabel, popUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nAltering the Label/Pop-up Menu Divider\\nWhile no physical vertical line divides a menu field\\'s label from its pop-up menu,\\nthere is indeed a defined boundary. By default, half of a menu field\\'s width is\\ndevoted to the label, and half is assigned to the menu. Consider this snippet:\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\n*popUpMenu;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Click Here\");\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Small\", new BMessage(SML_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Medium\", new BMessage(MED_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Large\", new BMessage(LRG_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Extra Large\", new BMessage(XLG_MSG)));\\nBMenuField\\nBRect\\n\\n*menuField;\\n\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"PopUp\", \"Size\", popUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\n\\nThis code creates a pop-up menu and adds it to a menu field. The BMenuField\\nobject has a width of 120 pixels (150.0  30.0). Thus the menu field divider, which\\nis given in coordinates local to the menu field\\'s view, would be 60.0. As shown in\\nthe top two windows of Figure 7-14, this 1:1 ratio isn\\'t always appropriate. Here\\nthe menu field label \"Size\" requires much less space than the pop-up menu name\\nof \"Click Here.\" Because the pop-up menu is constrained to half the menu field\\nwidth, the pop-up name is automatically condensed--as is the \"Extra Large\" menu\\nitem after it is selected.\\nTo devote more or less of a menu field to either the label or pop-up menu, use\\nthe BMenuField function SetDivider(). Pass this routine a floating-point value\\nto be used as the new divider. This one argument should be expressed in coordinates local to the menu field. Consider our current example, which produces a\\nmenu field with a width of 120 pixels. To move the divider from its halfway point\\nof 60 pixels to 30 pixels from the left edge of the menu field, pass a value of 30.0\\nto SetDivider():\\n\\nThe bottom two windows in Figure 7-14 show how the menu field looks after\\nmoving its divider. The pop-up menu now starts 30 pixels from the left of the\\nmenu field--just a few pixels to the left of the \"Size\" label. The pop-up menu now\\nhas room to expand horizontally; rather than being limited to 60 pixels in width,\\nthe menu can now occupy up to 90 of the menu field\\'s 120 pixels.\\nYou could use trial and error to find the amount of room appropriate for your pop\\nup\\'s label. But of course you\\'ll instead rely on the BView function\\nStringWidth()--the BMenuField class is derived from the BView class, so any\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-14. A menu field with its default divider (top) and an adjusted divider (bottom)\\n\\nview member function can be invoked by a pop-up menu object. When passed a\\nstring, StringWidth() returns the number of pixels that string requires (based on\\nthe characteristics of the font currently used by the BMenuField object). For\\ninstance:\\n#define\\nfloat\\n\\nlabelWidth;\\n\\nlabelWidth = menuField->StringWidth(\"Size\");\\nmenuField->SetDivider(labelWidth + LABEL_MARGIN);\\n\\nThe above snippet determines the width of the string \"Size\" (the label used in the\\nprevious snippets), then uses that pixel width in setting the width of the space\\nused to hold the label. Because the label starts a few pixels in from the left edge\\nof the area reserved for the label, a few pixels are added as a margin, or buffer. If\\nthat wasn\\'t done, the divider would be placed somewhere on the last character in\\nthe label, cutting a part of it off.\\n\\nSubmenus\\nA menu item can act as a submenu, or hierarchical menu--a menu within a\\nmenu. To operate a submenu, the user simply clicks on the submenu name,\\nexposing a new menu of choices. To choose an item from the submenu, the user\\nkeeps the mouse button held down, slides the cursor onto the item, and releases\\nthe mouse button. Figure 7-15 provides an example of a submenu. Here a separator item and a submenu have been added to the Visual menu that was introduced\\nin this chapter\\'s TwoMenus project. The Number of Shapes submenu consists of\\nthree items: 10, 20, and 30.\\n\\x0cSubmenus\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-15. An example of a submenu\\n\\nCreating a Submenu\\nA submenu is nothing more than a BMenu object that is added to another BMenu\\nobject in place of a menu item. Consider an Animals menu that has five types of\\nanimals for its menu items: armadillo, duck, labrador, poodle, and shepherd.\\nBecause three of the five animal types fall into the same category--dogs--this\\nexample would be well served by grouping the three dog items into a submenu.\\nFigure 7-16 shows what the Animals menu would look like with a submenu, and\\nthis next snippet shows the code needed to produce this menu:\\nBMenu\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n*subMenu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Animals\");\\nmenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Armadillo\", new BMessage(ARMADILLO_MSG)));\\nsubMenu = new BMenu(\"Dogs\");\\nmenu->AddItem(subMenu);\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Labrador\", new BMessage(LAB_MSG)));\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Poodle\", new BMessage(POODLE_MSG)));\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Shepherd\", new BMessage(SHEPHERD_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Duck\", new BMessage(DUCK_MSG)));\\n\\nNotice in this snippet that while I\\'ve given the variable used to represent the submenu the name subMenu, it really is nothing more than a BMenu object. The items\\nin the Dogs submenu were added the same way as the items in the Animal\\nmenu--by invoking the BMenu member function AddItem().\\n\\nSubmenu Example Project\\nThe MenusAndSubmenus project builds an application that displays the window\\nshown back in Figure 7-15. Most of the code in this project comes from the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-16. Categorizing things using a menu and submenu\\n\\nTwoMenus project, along with new code supporting the new submenu. The\\nMyHelloWindow class now holds a new int32 data member named fNumShapes\\nthat keeps track of the number of circles or squares that should be used when\\nDraw Circles or Draw Squares is selected:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n*fMyView;\\nBButton\\n*fButtonBeep;\\nBMenuBar\\n*fMenuBar;\\nfNumBeeps;\\nfNumShapes;\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor includes new code that adds a separator item to\\nthe Visual menu and creates and initializes the Number of Shapes submenu that\\'s\\nnow housed as the last item in the Visual menu. Here\\'s a part of the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor:\\nBMenu\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*subMenu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n// create menubar and add to window\\n// create Audio menu, add to menubar, add items to it, set\\n// to radio mode and mark one item\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Visual\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddSeparatorItem();\\nsubMenu = new BMenu(\"Number of Shapes\");\\nmenu->AddItem(subMenu);\\n\\x0cSubmenus\\n\\n\\nsubMenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"10\",\\nsubMenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nfNumShapes = 10;\\n\\nAs shown, a submenu can be set to radio mode, and an item in the submenu can\\nbe marked, just as is done for a menu that\\'s added to a menubar.\\nThe MessageReceived() function needs three new case sections--one to handle each of the three new messages that result from the submenu item selections:\\nfNumShapes = 10;\\nbreak;\\nfNumShapes = 20;\\nbreak;\\nfNumShapes = 30;\\nbreak;\\n\\nTwo of the existing case sections in MessageReceived() need modification.\\nNow the number of shapes to use in the drawing of the concentric circles or\\nsquares gets passed to the MyDrawView member function SetViewPicture():\\ncase MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_CIRCLES, fNumShapes);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_SQUARES, fNumShapes);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe MyDrawView member function SetViewPicture() makes use of the new\\nparameter as the index that determines how many times InsetRect() and\\nStrokeRect() are called.\\n\\x0c\\nText\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Fonts\\n Simple Text\\n Editable Text\\n Scrolling\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe BeOS makes it simple to display text in a view--you\\'ve seen several examples of calling the BView functions SetFont() and DrawString() to specify\\nwhich font a view should use and then draw a line of text. This approach works\\nfine for small amounts of plain text; your application, however, is more likely to\\nbe rich in both graphics and text--so you\\'ll want to take advantage of the BFont,\\nBStringView, BTextView, BScrollBar, and BScrollView classes.\\nThe BFont class creates objects that define the characteristics of fonts. You create\\na BFont object based on an existing font, then alter any of several characteristics.\\nThe BeOS is quite adept at manipulating fonts. You can alter basic font features\\nsuch as size and spacing, but you can also easily change other more esoteric font\\ncharacteristics such as shear and angle of rotation. You can use this new font in\\nsubsequent calls to DrawString(), or as the font in which text is displayed in\\nBStringView, BTextView, or BScrollView objects.\\nA BStringView object displays a line of text, as a call to the BView function\\nDrawString() does. Because the text of a BStringView exists as an object, this\\ntext knows how to update itself--something that the text produced by a call to\\nDrawString() doesn\\'t know how to do.\\nMore powerful than the BStringView class is the BTextView class. A BTextView\\nobject is used to display small or large amounts of editable text. The user can perform standard editing techniques (such as cut, copy, and paste) on the text of a\\nBTextView object. And the user (or the program itself) can alter the font or font\\ncolor of some or all of the text in such an object.\\nIf the text of a BTextView object extends beyond the content area of the object, a\\nscrollbar simplifies the user\\'s viewing. The BScrollBar class lets you add a scrollbar to a BTextView. Before adding that scrollbar, though, you should consider\\n\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\ncreating a BScrollView object. As its name implies, such an object has built-in\\nsupport for scrollbars. Create a BTextView object to hold the text, then create a\\nBScrollView object that names the text view object as the scroll view\\'s target. Or,\\nif you\\'d like to scroll graphics rather than text, name a BView object as the target\\nand then include a BPicture in that BView. While this chapter\\'s focus is on text,\\nit does close with an example adding scrollbars to a view that holds a picture.\\n\\nFonts\\nIn the BeOS API, the BFont class defines the characteristics of a font--its style,\\nsize, spacing, and so forth. While the BFont class has not been emphasized in\\nprior chapters, it has been used throughout this book. Every BView object (and\\nthus every BView-derived object) has a current font that affects text displayed in\\nthat view. In previous examples, the BView-derived MyDrawView class used its\\nAttachedToWindow() function to call a couple of BView functions to adjust the\\nview\\'s font: SetFont() to set the font, and SetFontSize() to set the font\\'s size:\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nA view\\'s current font is used in the display of characters drawn using the BView\\nfunction DrawString(). Setting a view\\'s font characteristics in the above fashion\\naffects text produced by calls to DrawString() in each MyDrawView object.\\nThe above snippet illustrates that the examples to this point have done little to\\nalter the look of a font. Making more elaborate modifications is an easy task. Later\\nin this chapter, you\\'ll use some of the following techniques on text displayed in\\ntext view objects--editable text objects based on the BTextView class.\\n\\nSystem Fonts\\nWhen designing the interface for your application, you\\'ll encounter instances\\nwhere you want a consistent look in displayed text. For example, your application may have a number of windows that include instructional text. In such a case,\\nyou\\'ll want the text to have the same look from window to window. To ensure\\nthat your application can easily do this, the BeOS defines three fonts guaranteed to\\nexist and remain constant for the running of your application.\\nThe three global system fonts\\nThe three constant fonts, or global system fonts, are BFont objects. When an application launches, these BFont objects are created, and three global pointers are\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nassigned to reference them. Table 8-1 shows these global BFont objects.\\nFigure 8-1 shows a window running on my machine; the figure includes a line of\\ntext written in each of the three system fonts.\\nTable 8-1. Global Fonts and Their Usage\\nBFont Global Pointer\\n\\nCommon Font Usage\\n\\nbe_plain_font\\n\\nControls, such as checkboxes and buttons, have their labels displayed in this font. Menu items also appear in this font.\\n\\nbe_bold_font\\n\\nWindow titles appear in this font.\\n\\nbe_fixed_font\\n\\nThis font is used for proportional, fixed-width characters.\\n\\nFigure 8-1. An example of text produced from the three global fonts\\n\\nContradictory as it sounds, the user can change the font that\\'s used for any of the\\nglobal system fonts. Figure 8-2 shows that the FontPanel preferences program lets\\nthe user pick a different plain, bold, or fixed font. This means that your application can\\'t count on a global font pointer (such as be_plain_font) always representing the same font on all users\\' machines. You can, however, count on a global font pointer to always represent only a single font on any given user\\'s\\nmachine--regardless of which font that is. So while you may not be able to anticipate what font the user will view when you make use of a global font pointer in\\nyour application, you are assured that the user will view the same font each time\\nthat global font pointer is used by your application.\\nUsing a global system font\\nYou\\'ve already seen how to specify one of the global fonts as the font to be used\\nby a particular view: just call the BView function SetFont() within one of the\\nview\\'s member functions. The AttachedToWindow() snippet that appears above\\nprovides an example. That method initializes all of the objects of a particular class\\nto use the same font. In the above example, all MyDrawView objects will initially\\ndisplay text in the font referenced by be_bold_font. For a particular view to have\\nits current font set to a different system font, have that view call SetFont() after\\nthe view has been created:\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-2. The FontPanel preferences application window\\nMyDrawView\\n\\n*theDrawView;\\n\\ntheDrawView = new MyDrawView(frameRect, \"MyDrawView\");\\ntheDrawView->SetFont(be_plain_font);\\n\\nWhile a BeOS machine may have more than the three system fonts installed, your\\napplication shouldn\\'t make any font-related assumptions. You can\\'t be sure every\\nuser has a non-system font your application uses; some users may experience\\nunpredictable results when running your application. If you want your program to\\ndisplay text that looks different from the global fonts (such as a very large font like\\n48 points), you can still use a global font to do so, as the next section illustrates.\\n\\nYour program shouldn\\'t force the user to have a particular nonsystem font on his or her machine, but it can give the user the\\noption of displaying text in a non-system font. Consider a word processor you\\'re developing. The default font should be be_plain_\\nfont. But your application could have a Font menu that allows for\\nthe display of text in any font on the user\\'s computer. Querying the\\nuser\\'s machine for available fonts is a topic covered in the BFont\\nsection of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nGlobal fonts are not modifiable\\nA global font is an object defined to be constant, so it can\\'t be altered by an application. If a program could alter a global font, the look of text in other applications\\nwould be affected. Instead, programs work with copies of global fonts. While calling a BView function such as SetFontSize() may seem to be changing the size\\nof a font, it\\'s not. A call to SetFontSize() simply specifies the point size at\\nwhich to display characters. The font itself isn\\'t changed--the system simply calculates a new size for each character and displays text using these new sizes. Consider this snippet:\\nMyDrawView\\nMyDrawView\\n\\n\\ndrawView1->DrawString(\"This will be bold, 24 point text\");\\ndrawView2->DrawString(\"This will be bold, 12 point text\");\\n\\nThis code specifies that the MyDrawView object drawView1 use the be_bold_\\nfont in the display of characters. The code also sets this object to display these\\ncharacters in a 24-point size. The second MyDrawView object, drawView2, also\\nuses the be_bold_font. When drawing takes place in drawView1, it will be 24\\npoints in size. A call to DrawString() from drawView2 doesn\\'t result in 24-point\\ntext, though. That\\'s because the call to SetFontSize() didn\\'t alter the font be_\\nbold_font itself. Instead, it only marked the drawView2 object to use 24 points\\nas the size of text it draws.\\nMaking global fonts unmodifiable is a good thing, of course. Having a global font\\nremain static means that from the time your application launches until the time it\\nterminates, you can always rely on the font having the same look. Of course, there\\nwill be times when your application will want to display text in a look that varies\\nfrom that provided by any of the three global fonts. That\\'s the topic of the next\\nsection.\\n\\nAltering Font Characteristics\\nIf you want to display text in a look that doesn\\'t match one of the system fonts,\\nand you want to be able to easily reuse this custom look, create your own BFont\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nobject. Pass the BFont constructor one of the three global system fonts and the\\nconstructor will return a copy of it to your application:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\nThe BFont object theFont is a copy of the font referenced by be_bold_font, so\\ntheFont can be modified. To do that, invoke the BFont member function appropriate for the characteristic to change. For instance, to set the font\\'s size, call\\nSetSize():\\n\\nA look at the BFont class declaration in the Font.h BeOS API header file hints at\\nsome of the other modifications you can make to a BFont object. Here\\'s a partial\\nlisting of the BFont class:\\nclass BFont {\\npublic:\\nBFont();\\nBFont(const BFont &font);\\nBFont(const BFont *font);\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n...\\nvoid\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n...\\nfloat\\n...\\n\\nSetFamilyAndStyle(const font_family family,\\nconst font_style style);\\nSetSize(float size);\\nSetShear(float shear);\\nSetRotation(float rotation);\\nGetFamilyAndStyle(font_family *family, font_style *style)\\nconst;\\nFamilyAndStyle() const;\\nSize() const;\\nShear() const;\\nRotation() const;\\nSpacing() const;\\nEncoding() const;\\nFace() const;\\nStringWidth(const char *string) const;\\n\\n}\\n\\nFor each member function that sets a font trait, there is a corresponding member\\nfunction that returns the same trait. An examination of a few of these font characteristics provides a basis for understanding how fonts are manipulated.\\nFont size\\nAn example of setting a BFont object\\'s point size was shown above. An example\\nof determining the current point size of that same BFont object follows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nfloat\\n\\ntheSize;\\n\\ntheSize = theFont.Size();\\n\\nYou\\'ve already seen that in order for a view to make use of a font, that font needs\\nto become the view\\'s current font. The BView function SetFont() performs that\\ntask. Numerous examples have demonstrated this routine\\'s use in setting a view\\'s\\nfont to one of the global system fonts, but you can use SetFont() with any\\nBFont object. Here, one view is having its font set to the global system font be_\\nplain_font, while another is having its font set to an application-defined BFont\\nobject:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\n\\nThis snippet demonstrates how to replace whatever font a view is currently using\\nwith another font--the drawView1 view was making use of some font before the\\ncall to SetFont(). There will be times when you won\\'t want to replace a view\\'s\\nfont, but rather simply alter one or more of the traits of the view\\'s current font. To\\ndo that, call the BView function GetFont() to first get a copy of the view\\'s current font. Make the necessary changes to this copy, then call SetFont() to make\\nit the view\\'s new current font. Here, a view\\'s current font has its size changed:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont;\\n\\ntheDrawView->GetFont(&theFont);\\ntheDrawView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFont shear\\nA font\\'s shear is the slope, or angle, at which the font\\'s characters are drawn. Pass\\nthe BFont function SetShear() a value in degrees and the routine will use it to\\nadjust the amount of slope characters have. The range of values SetShear()\\naccepts is 45.0 to 135.0. As Figure 8-3 shows, this angle is relative to the baseline\\non which characters are drawn. You\\'ll also note that the degrees are measured\\nclockwise. A value of 45.0 produces the maximum slant to the left, while a value\\nof 135.0 produces the maximum slant to the right. The following code generates\\nthe three strings shown in Figure 8-3:\\nBFont theFont(be_plain_font);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFigure 8-3. Output of text when the font\\'s shear is varied\\n\\nFont rotation\\nThe SetRotation() function in the BFont class makes it easy to draw text that\\'s\\nrotated to any degree. Pass SetRotation() a value in degrees, and subsequent\\ntext drawn to the view will be rotated. The degrees indicate how much the baseline on which text is drawn should be rotated. Figure 8-4 shows that the angle is\\nrelative to the original, horizontal baseline. Degrees are measured clockwise: a\\npositive rotation means that subsequent text will be drawn at an angle upward,\\nwhile a negative rotation means that text will be drawn at an angle downward.\\nThis next snippet produces the text shown in the window in Figure 8-4:\\nBFont theFont(be_plain_font);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFigure 8-4. Output of text when the font\\'s rotation is varied\\n\\nFonts Example Project\\nThe FontSetting project demonstrates how to create BFont objects and use them\\nas a view\\'s current font. As Figure 8-5 shows, this example also demonstrates how\\nto set the angle at which text is drawn, as well as how to rotate text.\\n\\nFigure 8-5. The FontSetting example program\\'s window\\n\\nI won\\'t need a sophisticated program to show off a few of the things that can be\\ndone with fonts; a single menuless window will do. The FontSetting project\\'s\\nMyHelloWindow class has only one data member: the familiar drawing view\\nfMyView. The MyDrawView class has no data members. Both the MyDrawView\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nconstructor and the MyDrawView function AttachedToWindow() are empty. The\\nonly noteworthy function is the MyDrawView routine Draw(), shown here:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nSetFont(be_plain_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point plain font\");\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point bold font\");\\nSetFont(be_fixed_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point fixed font\");\\nBFont font;\\nGetFont(&font);\\nSetFont(&font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point 60 shear fixed font\");\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nGetFont(&font);\\nSetFont(&font);\\nDrawString(\"rotated\");\\n}\\n\\nThe code in Draw() falls into five sections, each section ending with a call to\\nDrawString(). Each of the first three sections:\\n\\n\\nSets the view\\'s font to one of the three system fonts\\n\\n\\n\\nSets the view to draw text in 18-point size\\n\\n\\n\\nMoves the pen to the starting location for drawing\\n\\n\\n\\nDraws a string\\n\\nTo draw each of the first three lines of text in 18-point size, note that after each\\ncall to SetFont(), SetFontSize() needs to be called. That\\'s because a call to\\nSetFont() uses all of the characteristics of the passed-in font. Thus, the second\\ncall to SetFont()--the call that sets the drawing view to draw in be_bold_\\nfont--sets the view to draw text in whatever point size the user defines for the\\nbe_bold_font (defined for the bold font in the FontPanel preferences window).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe fourth code section demonstrates how to change one aspect of a view\\'s current font without affecting the font\\'s other attributes. A call to GetFont() returns a\\ncopy of the view\\'s current font. A call to the BFont function SetShear() alters\\nthe shear of the font. A call to SetFont() then establishes this font as the view\\'s\\nnew current font.\\nThe final section of code provides a second example of changing some characteristics of a view\\'s current font without overwriting all of its traits. Here the view\\'s\\nfont is set to be_bold_font, a copy is retrieved, and the size and rotation of the\\ncopied font are changed. This new font is then used as the view\\'s current font\\nbefore drawing the string \"rotated.\"\\n\\nSimple Text\\nThroughout this book you\\'ve seen that you can draw a string in any view by\\ninvoking the BView\\'s DrawString() function. DrawString() is a handy routine\\nbecause it\\'s easy to use--just call MovePenTo() or MovePenBy() to establish the\\nstarting point for a string, then pass DrawString() the text to draw. Drawing text\\nwith DrawString() has one distinct shortcoming, though. Unless the call is made\\nfrom within the view\\'s Draw() function, the text drawn by DrawString() won\\'t\\nautomatically be updated properly whenever all or part of the text comes back\\ninto view after being obscured. A call to DrawString() simply draws text--it\\ndoesn\\'t create a permanent association between the text and the view, and it\\ndoesn\\'t create any kind of string object with the power to update itself. The\\nBStringView class exists to overcome these deficiencies.\\nA BStringView object draws a single line of text, just as DrawString() does.\\nUnlike the DrawString() text, however, the BStringView object\\'s text automatically gets updated whenever necessary. While the text displayed by the\\nBStringView object can be changed during runtime (see the \"Setting the text in a\\nstring\" section ahead), it isn\\'t user-editable. It also doesn\\'t word-wrap, and it can\\'t\\nbe scrolled. That makes a BStringView object ideal for creating simple, static text\\nsuch as that used for a label, but undesirable for displaying large amounts of text\\nor user-editable text. For working with more sophisticated text objects, refer to the\\ndescription of the BTextView class in this chapter\\'s \"Editable Text\" section.\\n\\nThe BStringView Class\\nCreate a BStringView object by invoking the BStringView constructor. The\\nBStringView class is derived from the BView class. In creating a new string view\\nobject, the BStringView constructor passes all but its text parameter on to the\\nBView constructor:\\nBStringView(BRect frame,\\nconst char *name,\\n\\x0cSimple Text\\n\\nconst char *text,\\nuint32 resizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nuint32 flags = B_WILL_DRAW)\\n\\nThe frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of the view. The\\ntext displayed by the BStringView object won\\'t word wrap within this rectangle,\\nso it must have a width sufficient to display the entire string. The name parameter\\ndefines a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The\\nresizingMode parameter specifies the behavior of the view in response to a\\nchange in the size of the string view\\'s parent view. The flags parameter is a\\nmask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of\\nnotifications the view is to respond to.\\nThe text parameter establishes the text initially displayed by the BStringView\\nobject. The text can be passed between quotes or, as shown below, a variable of\\ntype const char * can be used as the text argument. After creating the string\\nview object, call AddChild() to add the new object to a parent view:\\nBStringView\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n*theString;\\n*theText = \"This string will be automatically updated\";\\n\\ntheString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\", theText);\\nAddChild(theString);\\n\\nFor simplicity, this snippet hardcodes the string view\\'s boundary. Alternatively,\\nyou could rely on the StringWidth() function to determine the pixel width of\\nthe string and then use that value in determining the coordinates of the view rectangle. In Chapter 7, Menus, this routine was introduced and discussed as a BView\\nmember function. Here you see that the BFont class also includes such a function. By default, a new BStringView object uses the be_plain_font (which is a\\nglobal BFont object), so that\\'s the object to use when invoking StringWidth().\\nHere, I\\'ve modified the preceding snippet to use this technique:\\n#define\\n\\nFRAME_LEFT\\n\\n\\nBStringView\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nfloat\\n\\n*theString;\\nstringFrame;\\n*theText = \"This string will be automatically updated\";\\ntextWidth;\\n\\ntextWidth = be_plain_font->StringWidth(theText);\\nstringFrame.Set(FRAME_LEFT, 10.0, FRAME_LEFT + textWidth, 30.0);\\ntheString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\", theText);\\nAddChild(theString);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nManipulating the Text in a String\\nOnce a string view object is created, its text can be altered using a variety of\\nBStringView member functions.\\nSetting the text in a string\\nThe text of a BStringView object isn\\'t directly editable by the user, but the program can change it. To do that, invoke the BStringView function SetText(),\\npassing the new text as the only parameter. In the following snippet, the text of\\nthe string view object created in the previous snippet is changed from \"This string\\nwill be automatically updated\" to \"Here\\'s the new text\":\\ntheString->SetText(\"Here\\'s the new text\");\\n\\nTo obtain the current text of a string view object, call the BStringView member\\nfunction Text():\\nconst char\\n\\n*stringViewText;\\n\\nstringViewText = theString->Text();\\n\\nAligning text in a string\\nBy default, the text of a BStringView object begins at the left border of the\\nobject\\'s frame rectangle. You can alter this behavior by invoking the BStringView\\nmember function SetAlignment(). This routine accepts one of three Be-defined\\nalignment constants: B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_ALIGN_RIGHT, or B_ALIGN_CENTER. Here\\nthe left-aligned default characteristic of the text of the BStringView object\\ntheString is altered such that it is now right-aligned:\\ntheString->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_RIGHT);\\n\\nYou can obtain the current alignment of a BStringView object\\'s text by invoking\\nthe BStringView function Alignment(). This routine returns a value of type\\nalignment. Unsurprisingly, the constants B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_ALIGN_RIGHT, and\\nB_ALIGN_CENTER are of this type, so you can compare the returned value to one\\nor more of these constants. Here, the alignment of the text in a BStringView\\nobject is checked to see if it is currently centered:\\nalignment\\n\\ntheAlignment;\\n\\ntheAlignment = theString->Alignment();\\nif (theAlignment == B_ALIGN_CENTER)\\n// you\\'re working with text that is centered\\n\\x0cSimple Text\\n\\n\\nChanging the look of the text in the string\\nA new BStringView object\\'s text is displayed in black and in the system plain\\nfont. A BStringView object is a BView object, so BView member functions such\\nas SetHighColor(), SetFont(), and SetFontSize() can be invoked to change\\nthe characteristics of a string view object\\'s text. Here, the color of the text of a\\nBStringView object is changed from black to red by altering the string view\\'s\\nhigh color. The text\\'s font and size are changed as well:\\ntheString->SetHighColor(redColor);\\ntheString->SetFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\nYou can make more sophisticated changes to the look of the text displayed in a\\nBStringView object by creating a BFont object, modifying any of the font\\'s characteristics (using the techniques shown in this chapter\\'s \"Fonts\" section), and then\\nusing that font as the BStringView object\\'s font. Here, the font currently used by\\na string view object is retrieved, its shear changed, and the altered font is again\\nused as the string view object\\'s font:\\nBFont theFont;\\ntheString->GetFont(&theFont);\\ntheString->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nString View Example Project\\nThe StringView project produces the window shown in Figure 8-6. The \"Here\\'s the\\nnew text\" string is a BStringView object, so the text is automatically redrawn\\nafter the user obscures the window and then reveals it again. The Text menu\\nholds a single item named Test that, when selected, does nothing more than generate a system beep. Subsequent examples in this chapter add to this menu.\\n\\nFigure 8-6. The StringView example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe BStringView object will be added to the window\\'s main view--the window\\'s one MyDrawView object. To make it easy for you to manipulate the string\\nlater in the program, I keep track of the string by making it a data member in the\\nMyDrawView class.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBStringView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fString;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe BStringView object\\'s frame rectangle has a left boundary of 10 pixels. The\\nBStringView object\\'s parent view is the window\\'s fMyView view. The width of\\nthe MyDrawView fMyView is the same as the window, so the default state for the\\nBStringView text has the text starting 10 pixels from the left edge of the window. Figure 8-6 makes it clear that this isn\\'t the starting point of the text. A call to\\nSetAlignment() is responsible for this discrepancy--the string view object\\'s text\\nhas been changed to right-aligned. The text\\'s look has been changed from its\\ndefault state by calling the BView functions SetFont() and SetFontSize(). You\\ncan\\'t tell from Figure 8-6 that the text appears in red rather than black. It\\'s a call to\\nSetHighColor() that makes this color change happen. Here\\'s the StringView\\nproject\\'s MyDrawView constructor, which shows all the pertinent code:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect\\nfString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\",\\n\"This string will be automatically updated\");\\nAddChild(fString);\\nfString->SetText(\"Here\\'s the new text\");\\nfString->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_RIGHT);\\nfString->SetHighColor(redColor);\\nfString->SetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nEditable Text\\nA BStringView object is ideal for displaying a small amount of uneditable text.\\nWhen your application needs to display a larger amount of text that is usereditable, though, it\\'s time to switch to a BTextView object. A BTextView object\\nautomatically implements keyboard editing, and makes it easy to add menu edit-\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\ning. And while a text view object initially displays all its text in a single font and a\\nsingle color, you can easily alter the object to support multiple fonts and multiple\\ncolors--even within the same paragraph.\\n\\nThe BTextView Class\\nThe BTextView class used to create an editable text object is derived from the\\nBView class. So, as expected, several of the BTextView constructor parameters\\nwill be immediately familiar to you:\\nBTextView(BRect\\nconst char\\nBRect\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\ntextRect,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nThe frame, name, and resizingMode parameters serve the same purposes as they\\ndo for the BView class. The flags parameter is made up of one or more Bedefined constants that determine the kinds of notifications the view is to respond\\nto. Regardless of which constant or constants you pass as the flags parameter,\\nthe BTextView constructor goes behind your back to add a couple more constants before forwarding flags to the BView constructor it invokes. These two\\nBTextView-added constants are B_FRAME_EVENTS, to allow the BTextView object\\nto reformat its text when it is resized, and B_PULSE_NEEDED, to allow the text\\ninsertion caret to blink properly.\\nThe one BTextView constructor parameter unique to the BTextView class is\\ntextRect. This rectangle specifies the boundaries for the text that will eventually\\nbe placed in the BTextView object.\\nBTextView frame and text rectangles\\nAt first glance, the purpose of the BTextView constructor\\'s textRect rectangle\\nmay seem to be redundant--the frame parameter is also a boundary-defining rectangle. Here\\'s the difference: the frame rectangle defines the size of the\\nBTextView object, as well as where the BTextView object resides in its parent\\nview. The textRect parameter defines the size of the text area within the\\nBTextView object, and where within the BTextView object this text area is to be\\nsituated. By default, a BTextView object has a frame the size of the frame rectangle drawn around it. The textRect rectangle doesn\\'t have a frame drawn around\\nit. Thus, the textRect rectangle provides for a buffer, or empty space, surrounding typed-in text and the BTextView object\\'s frame. Figure 8-7 illustrates this.\\nIn Figure 8-7, the dark-framed rectangle represents the frame rectangle, the first\\nparameter to the BTextView constructor. The light-framed rectangle represents the\\ntextRect rectangle. Neither of these rectangles would be visible to the user; I\\'ve\\nshown them in the figure only to make it obvious where their boundaries are in\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nFigure 8-7. A BTextView object consists of two rectangles\\n\\nthis particular example. The arrows would not be in the window either--I\\'ve\\nadded them to make it clear that the coordinates of the textBounds rectangle are\\nrelative to the viewFrame rectangle. Here\\'s the code that sets up a BTextView\\nobject like the one shown in Figure 8-7:\\nBTextView\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n*theTextView;\\n\\ntheTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(theTextView);\\n\\nIn this snippet, the viewFrame rectangle defines the text view object frame to be\\n170 pixels wide by 80 pixels high. The textBounds rectangle specifies that the\\nfirst character typed into the text view object will have 20 pixels of white space\\nbetween the object\\'s left edge and the character and 20 pixels of white space\\nbetween the object\\'s top edge and the top of the character. The textBounds rectangle\\'s right boundary, 130, means there will be 40 pixels of white space between\\nthe end of a line of text and the text object\\'s right boundary (see Figure 8-7).\\nWhile I\\'ve discussed at length the BTextView constructor parameters, I\\'m compelled to elaborate just a bit more on the two rectangles. Figure 8-7 and the\\naccompanying code snippet exhibit a text object whose text area rectangle provides large and non-uniform borders between it and the text object itself. But it\\'s\\nmuch more typical to define a text area rectangle that has a small, uniform border. This example exaggerated the border size simply to make the relationship\\nbetween the two rectangles clear.\\nAnother point to be aware of is that the top and bottom coordinates of the text\\narea rectangle become unimportant as the user enters text that exceeds the size of\\nthe text area rectangle. The bottom coordinate of the text area rectangle is always\\nignored--the text view object will accept up to 32K of text and will automatically\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nscroll the text as the user types, always displaying the currently typed characters.\\nAnd as the text scrolls, the top coordinate of the text area rectangle becomes\\nmeaningless; the text view object will display the top line of scrolling text just a\\npixel or so away from the top of the text view object.\\nText view example project\\nThe TextView project displays a window like the one shown in Figure 8-8. To\\nmake the text view object\\'s boundaries clear, the program outlines the object with\\na line one pixel in width. As it did for the StringView project, the Text menu holds\\na single item named Test. Choosing this item simply generates a system beep.\\n\\nFigure 8-8. The TextView example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe text view object will be added to the window-filling MyDrawView, so I\\'ve\\nadded a BTextView data member to the MyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBTextView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe normally empty MyDrawView constructor now holds the code to create a\\nBTextView object. The viewFrame rectangle defines the size and placement of\\nthe text view object. This rectangle is declared outside of the MyDrawView constructor because, as you see ahead, it sees additional use in other MyDrawView\\nmember functions. The TEXT_INSET constant is used in establishing the boundaries of the text view object\\'s text area; that area will have a 3-pixel inset from\\neach side of the text view object itself:\\n#define\\nBRect\\n\\nTEXT_INSET\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\n}\\n\\nAfter using viewFrame to establish the size and placement of the text view object,\\nthis rectangle\\'s size is expanded by 2 pixels in each direction (recall from\\nChapter 5, Drawing, that a negative number as an argument to the BView member function InsetBy() moves the affected view\\'s frame outward in one direction). This is done in preparation for drawing a border around the text view area.\\nClicking on a text view object causes a blinking insertion point caret to appear in\\nthe text area of that object. The programmer can \"jump start,\" or force, this caret to\\nappear in a text view object by making the object the focus view. The final setup\\nwork for a MyDrawView object takes place in the AttachedToWindow() member\\nfunction, so that\\'s an appropriate enough place to make a call to the BView function MakeFocus():\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nfTextView->MakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nThe AttachedToWindow() calls to SetFont() and SetFontSize()\\ndon\\'t affect the font used in the text view object. They\\'re called by\\nthe MyDrawView object, so they affect text drawn directly in such an\\nobject (there just doesn\\'t happen to be any text drawn in this example\\'s MyDrawView object). To change the font of a text view object,\\ninvoke the BTextView function SetFontAndColor() from the text\\nview object. Refer to \"Text Characteristics,\" in this chapter.\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor ended with the coordinates of the rectangle\\nviewFrame being enlarged a couple of pixels in each direction. This was done to\\ndefine a rectangle with boundaries just outside the boundaries of the text view\\nobject. When used as an argument to StrokeRect(), this rectangle provides a\\nframe for the text view object. I\\'ve placed the call to StrokeRect() in the\\nMyDrawView Draw() function so that this frame always gets appropriately\\nupdated:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nStrokeRect(viewFrame);\\n}\\n\\nYou might be tempted to try to surround a text view object with a frame by simply calling StrokeRect() from the text view object. This won\\'t work, because the\\ntext view object holds text, not graphics. Instead, draw the frame in the text view\\nobject\\'s parent view as I\\'ve done above. The fTextView object was added to the\\nMyDrawView object, so I draw the text view object\\'s border in the MyDrawView\\nobject.\\n\\nText Editing\\nBy default, the user can select and edit some or all of the text that appears in a\\ntext view object. BTextView member functions, along with several Be-defined\\nmessage constants, provide you with a great degree of control over the level of\\nediting you want to allow in each text view object in a window.\\nDefault text editing\\nRegardless of which editing menu items you choose to include or not include in\\nthe menubar of the text object object\\'s parent window, the following text editing\\nshortcut keys are automatically supported:\\n\\n\\nCommand-x: Cut\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-c: Copy\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-v: Paste\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-a: Select All\\n\\nYou can verify that this notion of automatic text editing is true in practice by running the previous example program, TextView. Then type a few characters, select\\nsome or all of it, and press the Command and \"X\" keys. Even though the TextView project includes no text editing menu items and no text editing code, the\\nselected text will be cut.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nYou can deny the user the ability to edit text in the text view object by calling the\\nBTextView function MakeEditable(), passing a value of false:\\nfTextView->MakeEditable(false);\\n\\nAfter disabling text editing, you can again enable editing by calling\\nMakeEditable() with an argument of true. You can check the current editing\\nstate of a text object by calling IsEditable():\\nbool\\n\\ncanEdit;\\n\\ncanEdit = fTextView->IsEditable();\\n\\nIf you disable text editing for a text object, you may also want to disable text\\nselection. Like text editing, by default, text in a text object can be selected by\\nclicking and dragging the mouse. If you disable text editing, the user will be able\\nto select any number of characters in the text object. Since the user will be able to\\nselect and copy text, but won\\'t be able to paste copied text back into the view,\\nthis could lead to some confusion. To prevent the user from selecting text by\\ninvoking the BTextView member function MakeSelectable(), pass a value of\\nfalse as the sole argument:\\nfTextView->MakeSelectable(false);\\n\\nYou can enable text selection by again calling MakeSelectable(), this time with\\nan argument of true. You can check the current text selection state of a text view\\nobject by calling IsSelectable():\\nbool\\n\\ncanSelect;\\n\\ncanSelect = fTextView->IsSelectable();\\n\\nMenu items and text editing\\nUsers may not intuitively know that a text object automatically handles keyboard\\nshortcuts for copying, cutting, pasting, and selecting all of the object\\'s text. When\\nit comes time to perform text editing, the user will no doubt look in the menus of\\na window\\'s menubar for the basic editing menu items: the Cut, Copy, Paste, and\\nSelect All items. If you include one or more BTextView objects in a window of\\nyour program, you\\'d be wise to include these four menu items in an Edit menu.\\nAs you\\'ve seen, a BTextView object automatically provides shortcut key editing--\\nyou don\\'t need to write any code to enable the shortcut key combinations to\\nwork. The system also automatically supports menu item editing--menu item editing is easy to enable on a text view object, but you do need to write a little of\\nyour own code. While you don\\'t do any work to give a text view object shortcut\\nkey editing, you do need to do a little work to give that same object menu editing. All you need to do is build a menu with any or all of the four basic editing\\nitems. If you include the proper messages when creating the menu items, editing\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nwill be appropriately handled without any other application-defined code being\\npresent.\\nYou\\'re most familiar with the system message: a message that has a corresponding\\nhook function to which the system passes the message. A different type of message the system recognizes and reacts to is the standard message. A standard message is known to the system, and may be issued by the system, but it doesn\\'t have\\na hook function. Among the many standard messages the BeOS provides are four\\nfor editing, represented by the Be-defined constants B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE,\\nand B_SELECT_ALL. This brief definition of the standard message should tide you\\nover until Chapter 9, Messages and Threads, where this message type is described\\nin greater detail. The following snippet demonstrates how an Edit menu that holds\\na Cut menu item could be created. Assume that this code was lifted from the constructor of a BWindow-derived class constructor, and that a menubar referenced by\\na BMenuBar object named fMenuBar already exists:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Edit\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nRecall from Chapter 7 that the first parameter to the BMenuItem constructor,\\nlabel, specifies the new menu item\\'s label--the text the user sees in the menu.\\nThe second parameter, message, associates a message with the menu item. The\\nthird parameter, shortcut, assigns a shortcut key to the menu item. To let the\\nmenu item be responsible for cutting text, you must pass the Be-defined B_CUT\\nstandard message constant as shown above. The other required step is to set the\\ncurrently selected text view object as the destination of the message.\\nThe BInvoker class exists to allow objects to send a message to a BHandler\\nobject. The BMenuItem class is derived from the BInvoker class, so a menu item\\nobject can be invoked to send a message to a target. That\\'s exactly what happens\\nwhen the user selects a menu item. A window object is a type of BHandler (the\\nBWindow class is derived from BHandler), so it can be the target of a menu item\\nmessage. In fact, by default, the target of a menu item is the window that holds\\nthe menu item\\'s menubar. Typically, a menu item message is handled by the target window object\\'s MessageReceived() function, as has been demonstrated at\\nlength in Chapter 7. While having the window as the message recipient is often\\ndesirable, it isn\\'t a requirement. The BInvoker function SetTarget() can be\\ninvoked by a BInvoker object (such as a BMenuItem object) to set the message\\ntarget to any other BHandler object. The above snippet calls SetTarget() to set\\nthe active text view object to be the Cut menu item\\'s target.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe first parameter to SetTarget() is a BHandler object, while the second is a\\nBLooper object. Only one of these two parameters is ever used; the other is\\nalways passed a value of NULL. I\\'ll examine both possibilities next.\\nIf the target object is known at compile time, you can pass it as the first argument\\nand pass NULL as the second argument. If the window involved in the previous\\nsnippet had a single text view object referenced by an fMyText data member, the\\ncall to SetTarget() could look like this:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(fMyText, NULL);\\n\\nIf the window has more than one text view object, however, setting an editing\\nmenu item message to target one specific text view object isn\\'t desirable--selecting the menu item won\\'t have any effect on text that is selected in a text view\\nobject other than the one referenced by fMyText. The remedy in such a case is to\\ncall SetTarget() as shown here:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nWhen SetTarget() is called with a first argument of NULL, the second argument\\nis a BLooper object. Passing a looper object doesn\\'t set the looper object itself as\\nthe target--it sets the looper object\\'s preferred handler to be the target. An object\\'s\\npreferred handler is dependent on the object\\'s type, and can vary as the program\\nruns. If the above line of code appears in a BWindow-derived class constructor, the\\nthis argument represents the BWindow-derived object being created. In the case\\nof a BWindow-derived object, the preferred handler is whichever of the window\\'s\\nBHandler objects is the focus object when the window receives a message. For\\nediting, this makes perfect sense--you\\'ll want an editing operation such as the cutting of text to affect the text in the current text view object.\\n\\nEarlier I mentioned that the default target of a menu item message is\\nthe menu\\'s window. In the previous call to SetTarget(), the second argument is this, which is the menu\\'s window. If that makes it\\nseem like the call to SetTarget() is redundant, keep in mind that\\nthe object passed as the second argument to SetTarget() doesn\\'t\\nbecome the new target. Instead, that object\\'s preferred handler\\nbecomes the target.\\n\\nOther editing menu items are implemented in a manner similar to the Cut menu\\nitem. This next snippet adds Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All menu items to an Edit\\nmenu and, at the same time, provides a fully functional Edit menu that supports\\nediting operations in any number of text view objects:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Edit\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Copy\", new BMessage(B_COPY), \\'C\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE), \\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nThe handling of an edit item comes from the standard message (such\\nas B_CUT) that you use for the message parameter in the invocation\\nof the BMenuItem constructor--not from the string (such as \"Cut\")\\nthat you use for the label parameter. While the user will be expecting to see the familiar Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All menu item\\nnames, you could just as well give these items the names Expunge,\\nMimic, Inject, and Elect Every. From a more practical standpoint, a\\nprogram designed for non-English speaking people can include\\nnative text in the edit menu.\\n\\nText editing menu item example project\\nThe TextViewEdit project is a modification of this chapter\\'s TextView project. As\\nshown in Figure 8-9, four menu items have been added to the already present Test\\nitem in the Text menu. For simplicity, I\\'ve added these four editing items to the\\nexisting Text menu, but your application should stick with convention and include\\nthese items in a menu titled Edit.\\n\\nFigure 8-9. The TextViewEdit example program\\'s window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nFor this TextViewEdit project, the MyDrawView class and the implementation of\\nthe MyDrawView member functions are all unchanged from the TextView project:\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView class has a BTextView data member named fTextView.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor creates a BTextView object and assigns it to\\nfTextView.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachedToWindow() sets the focus view and sets up a rectangle to serve as\\na border for the text view object.\\n\\n\\n\\nDraw() draws the text view object\\'s border.\\n\\nThe modifications to the project are all found in the MyHelloWindow constructor.\\nHere, the four editing menu items are added to the already present Test menu\\nitem:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Text\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Test\", new BMessage(TEST_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Copy\", new BMessage(B_COPY),\\n\\'C\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE),\\n\\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class includes a MessageReceived() member function that\\nhandles only the first menu item in the Test menu: the Text item. If\\nMessageReceived() receives a TEST_MSG message, a call to beep() is made.\\nThe system routes the other message types (B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_\\nSELECT_ALL) to the focus view (which in this example is the one text view object)\\nfor automatic handling by that view.\\n\\nText Characteristics\\nWhile the characteristics of the text displayed by a BStringView object can be\\naltered by invoking BView functions such as SetFont() and SetHighColor(),\\nthe characteristics of the text displayed by a BTextView object should be altered\\nby invoking member functions of the BTextView class. For instance, to change\\neither the color or font, or both, of a BTextView object\\'s text, invoke the\\nBTextView function SetFontAndColor().\\nGetting BTextView text characteristics\\nA new BTextView object\\'s text is displayed in black and in the system\\'s current\\nplain font. A BTextView object is a BView object, so you might expect that\\nchanges to the object\\'s text would be carried out by BView member functions such\\nas SetHighColor() and SetFont(). While this is in fact true, it\\'s important to\\nnote that the calls to these BView functions are made indirectly. That is, the\\nBTextView class provides its own set of graphics member functions that a\\nBTextView object should invoke in order to affect the object\\'s text. Each of these\\nBTextView functions in turn invokes whatever BView functions are needed in\\norder to carry out its specific task. The BTextView functions GetFontAndColor()\\nand SetFontAndColor() are of primary importance in changing the characteristics of text displayed in a text view object.\\nGetFontAndColor() is your means to accessing a text view object\\'s current font\\nso that you can alter its properties. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nvoid GetFontAndColor(BFont\\nrgb_color\\nbool\\n\\n*font,\\n*sameProperties,\\n*color = NULL,\\n*sameColor = NULL)\\n\\nGetFontAndColor() returns information about BTextView in its four parameters. After you call GetFontAndColor(), the font parameter holds a copy of the\\ntext view object\\'s font. The sameProperties parameter is a mask that specifies\\nwhich of a number of the text view object\\'s font properties apply to all of the\\ncharacters in the current selection. GetFontAndColor() combines a number of\\nBe-defined constants to create the mask. For instance, if all of the characters in the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nselected text are the same size, a test of the returned value of sameProperties\\nwill reveal that it includes the value of the Be-defined constant B_FONT_SIZE:\\n// invoke GetFontAndColor() here\\nif (sameProperties && B_FONT_SIZE)\\n// all characters are the same size\\n\\nIf no text is currently selected at the time of the call to\\nGetFontAndColor(), the sameProperties mask will be set such\\nthat all of the properties test true. This makes sense because all of\\nthe selected characters--all none of them--do indeed share the\\nsame properties!\\n\\nThe third parameter, color, specifies the RGB color in which the text view\\nobject\\'s text is to be displayed. The color returned in this parameter is that of the\\nfirst character in the selected text (or the character following the insertion point if\\nno text is currently selected). The sameColor parameter indicates whether or not\\nall of the selected text (or all characters if no text is currently selected) is of the\\ncolor returned by the color parameter.\\nIf your only interest is in the font of a text view object, the color and sameColor\\nparameters can be safely ignored--these two parameters have a default value of\\nNULL. Here\\'s an example:\\nBFont\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\nfTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\n\\nIf, instead, your only interest is in the color of a text view object\\'s text, pass NULL\\nas the font parameter:\\nrgb_color\\nbool\\n\\nsameProperties;\\ncolor;\\nsameColor;\\n\\nfTextView->GetFontAndColor(NULL, &sameProperties, &color, &sameColor);\\n\\nAlternatively, you can pass a variable for each of the four arguments, then simply\\nignore the returned values of the variables that aren\\'t of interest.\\nA call to GetFontAndColor() doesn\\'t affect a text view object\\'s text in any way--\\nit simply returns to your program information about the text. Once you\\'ve\\nobtained a font and color, you\\'ll want to make changes to one or the other, or\\nboth.\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nSetting BTextView text characteristics\\nAfter obtaining a copy of a BTextView object\\'s font, you can make any desired\\nchanges to the font and then pass these changes back to the text view object. The\\nsame applies to the text\\'s color. The BTextView function SetFontAndColor()\\ntakes care of both of these tasks:\\nvoid SetFontAndColor(const BFont\\nrgb_color\\n\\n*font,\\nproperties = B_FONT_ALL,\\n*color = NULL)\\n\\nThe font, properties, and color parameters are the variables filled in by a previous call to GetFontAndColor(). In between the calls to GetFontAndColor()\\nand SetFontAndColor(), invoke one or more BFont functions to change the\\ndesired font trait. For instance, to change the size of the font used to display the\\ntext of a BTextView object named theTextView, invoke the BFont function\\nSetSize() as shown in the following snippet. Note that because this snippet isn\\'t\\nintended to change the color of the text in the theTextView text view object, the\\ncall to GetFontAndColor() omits the color and sameColor parameters:\\nBFont\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\ntheTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL);\\n\\nIn this snippet, the BFont object font gets its value from GetFontAndColor(), is\\naltered by the call to SetSize(), and then is passed back to the theTextView\\nobject by a call to SetFontAndColor(). The process is not, however, the same\\nfor the sameProperties variable.\\nRecall that the GetFontAndColor() uint32 parameter sameProperties returns\\na mask that specifies which font properties apply to all of the characters in the\\ncurrent selection. The SetFontAndColor() uint32 parameter properties, on\\nthe other hand, is a mask that specifies which properties of the BFont parameter\\npassed to SetFontAndColor() should be used in the setting of the text view\\nobject\\'s font.\\nConsider the following example: your program declares a BFont variable named\\ntheBigFont and sets a variety of its properties (such as size, rotation, and shear),\\nbut you\\'d only like SetFontAndColor() to apply this font\\'s size property to a\\nview object\\'s font (perhaps your program has set other characteristics of\\ntheBigFont because it plans to use the font elsewhere as well). To do that, pass\\nthe Be-defined constant B_FONT_SIZE as the second argument to\\nSetFontAndColor():\\nBFont\\n\\ntheBigFont(be_plain_font);\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&theBigFont, B_FONT_SIZE);\\n\\nIn this snippet, you\\'ll note that there\\'s no call to GetFontAndColor(). Unlike previous snippets, this code doesn\\'t obtain a copy of the current font used by\\ntheTextView, alter it, and pass the font back to theTextView. Instead, it creates\\na new font based on the system font be_plain_font, changes some of that font\\'s\\ncharacteristics, then passes this font to SetFontAndColor(). The important point\\nto note is that passing B_FONT_SIZE as the second properties mask tells\\nSetFontAndColor() to leave all of the characteristics of the font currently used\\nby theTextView unchanged except for its size. The new size will be that of the\\nfirst parameter, theBigFont. The font control definitions such as B_FONT_SIZE\\nare located in the View.h header file.\\nTo change the color of a BTextView object\\'s text, assign an rgb_color variable\\nthe desired color and then pass that variable as the third parameter to\\nSetFontAndColor(). Here, the BTextView theTextView is set to display the\\ncharacters in the current selection in red:\\nBFont\\nrgb_color\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\ntheTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL, &redColor);\\n\\nAllowing multiple character formats in a BTextView\\nBy default, all of the text that is typed or pasted into a BTextView object shares\\nthe same characteristics. That is, it all appears in the same font, the same size, the\\nsame color, and so forth. If the object is left in this default state, user attempts to\\nchange the characteristics of some of the text will fail--all of the text in the object\\nwill take on whatever change is made to any selected text. To allow for multiple\\ncharacter formats in a single text view object, pass a value of true to the\\nBTextView function SetStylable().\\ntheTextView->SetStylable(true);\\n\\nTo reverse the setting and prevent multiple character formats in a text view object,\\npass SetStylable() a value of false. Note that in doing this any styles that\\nwere previously applied to characters in the text view will now be lost. To test a\\ntext view object\\'s ability to support multiple character formats, call the BTextView\\nfunction IsStylable():\\nbool\\n\\nsupportsMultipleStyles;\\n\\nsupportsMultipleStyles = theTextView->IsStylable();\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nChanging the background color in a BTextView\\nChanges to the characteristics of text in a BTextView object are achieved by using\\na number of BFont functions in conjunction with the BTextView functions\\nGetFontAndColor() and SetFontAndColor(). Changes to the background color\\nof the text view object itself are accomplished by calling an inherited BView function rather than a BTextView routine. The BView function SetViewColor(),\\nwhich was introduced in Chapter 5, is called to change a text view object\\'s background. The call changes the background color of the entire text view object (that\\nis, it changes the background color of the text view object\\'s boundary or framing\\nrectangle--a rectangle that includes the text area rectangle). Here, the background of a BTextView object is changed to pink:\\ntheTextView->SetViewColor(pinkColor);\\n\\nAligning text in a BTextView\\nA characteristic of the text in a BTextView that isn\\'t dependent on the font is the\\ntext\\'s placement within the text area of the text view object. By default, the text\\nthe user enters into a BTextView object is left-aligned. You can change the alignment by invoking the BTextView member function SetAlignment(). This routine works just like the BStringView version described earlier in this chapter: it\\naccepts one of the three Be-defined alignment constants. Pass B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_\\nALIGN_RIGHT, or B_ALIGN_CENTER and the text that\\'s currently in the text view\\nobject\\'s text rectangle will be appropriately aligned: each line in the text view\\nobject will start at the alignment indicated by the constant. Here, a BTextView\\nobject named theText has its alignment set to centered:\\ntheText->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_CENTER);\\n\\nAny text subsequently entered in the affected BTextView object continues to follow the new alignment.\\nThe BTextView member function Alignment() is used to obtain the current\\nalignment of a text view object\\'s text. The BTextView version of Alignment()\\nworks just like the BStringView version. In this next snippet, the alignment of\\nthe text in a BTextView object is compared to the B_ALIGN_RIGHT constant to\\nsee if the text is currently right-aligned:\\nalignment\\n\\ntheAlignment;\\n\\ntheAlignment = theText->Alignment();\\nif (theAlignment == B_ALIGN_RIGHT)\\n// the text in this object is right-aligned\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nAnother BTextView function that affects text placement is SetWordWrap(). By\\ndefault, the text in a text view object word wraps: typed or pasted text fills the\\nwidth of the object\\'s text rectangle and then continues on the following line. Text\\ncan instead be forced to remain on a single line until a newline character (a hard\\nreturn established by a press of the Return key) designates that a new line be\\nstarted. Passing SetWordWrap() a value of false turns word wrapping off for a\\nparticular text view object, while passing a value of true turns word wrapping on.\\nTo test the current word wrapping state of a text view object, call the BTextView\\nfunction DoesWordWrap().\\n\\nWhile you can change the font characteristics (such as size and\\ncolor) of individual characters within a BTextView object, you can\\'t\\nchange the alignment of individual characters, words, or lines of text\\nwithin a single BTextView object. The setting of a BTextView\\nobject\\'s alignment or wrapping affects all characters in the view.\\n\\nText characteristics example project\\nThe TextViewFont project demonstrates how to add support for multiple character formats in a BTextView object. Figure 8-10 shows a window with a Text menu\\nand a BTextView object similar to the one appearing in this chapter\\'s TextView\\nand TextViewEdit example projects. Making a text selection and then choosing\\nAlter Text from the Text menu increases the size of the font of the selected text.\\nFor good measure (and to demonstrate the use of color in a BTextView), the Alter\\nText menu also changes the color of the selected text from black to red. In\\nFigure 8-10, the current selection consists of parts of the first and second words of\\ntext, and the Alter Text item has just been selected.\\n\\nFigure 8-10. The TextViewFont example program\\'s window\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nA menu item named Alter Text is fine for this simple example, but is\\na bit ambiguous for a real-world application. If your own program\\nincludes stylable text, then it should of course include separate\\nmenu items for each possible action. For instance, if your program\\nallows the user to change the size of selected text, it should have\\nIncrease Size and Decrease Size menu items, or a menu item for\\neach possible font point size. Similarly, if your program allows the\\ncolor of text to be changed, it should have either a separate menu\\nitem for each possible color, or a menu item that brings up a color\\ncontrol (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of the BColorControl class).\\n\\nEarlier in this chapter, you saw that a standard editing message such as B_CUT is\\nassigned to the focus view by using menu-creation code like that shown here:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nYou can set application-defined messages to go directly to the focus view in a similar manner. Here, FONT_TEST_MSG is an application-defined message type:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Alter Text\",\\nnew BMessage(FONT_TEST_MSG)));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nFor a standard editing message such as B_CUT, the work in handling the message\\nis done; the system knows what to do with a Be-defined standard message. For\\nmy own application-defined message, however, a bit more code is needed\\nbecause BTextView won\\'t know how to handle an application-defined FONT_\\nTEST_MSG. To create a BTextView object that can respond to an applicationdefined message, I defined a MyTextView class derived from BTextView. From\\nMyTextView.h, here\\'s the new class and the definition of the new message type:\\n#define\\n\\nFONT_TEST_MSG\\n\\n\\'fntt\\'\\n\\nclass MyTextView : public BTextView {\\npublic:\\nMyTextView(BRect viewFrame, char *name, BRect textBounds);\\nvirtual void\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n};\\n\\nThe MyTextView class consists of just two functions: a constructor to create a new\\nobject and a version of MessageReceived() that will be capable of handling the\\napplication-defined message. The implementation of these new functions can be\\nfound in MyTextView.cp. From that file, here\\'s the MyTextView constructor:\\nMyTextView::MyTextView(BRect viewFrame, char *name, BRect textBounds)\\n: BTextView(viewFrame, name, textBounds, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe MyTextView constructor is empty--it does nothing more than invoke the\\nBTextView constructor. For this example, I\\'m satisfied with how a BTextView\\nobject looks and works, so I\\'ve implemented the MyTextView constructor such\\nthat it simply passes the arguments it receives on to the BTextView constructor.\\nThe real purpose of creating the BTextView-derived class is to create a class that\\noverrides the BTextView version of MessageReceived(). The new version of\\nthis routine handles messages of the application-defined type FONT_TEST_MSG:\\nvoid MyTextView::MessageReceived(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase FONT_TEST_MSG:\\nBFont\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\nGetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\nSetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL, &redColor);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nMessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhen an object of type MyTextView receives a FONT_TEST_MSG message,\\nGetFontAndColor() is called to obtain a copy of the object\\'s font. The size of the\\nfont is set to 24 points and SetFontAndColor() is called to pass the font back to\\nthe MyTextView object. When calling SetFontAndColor(), the rgb_color variable redColor is included in the parameter list in order to set the MyTextView\\nobject to use a shade of red in displaying text.\\nAs is always the case, it\\'s important that MessageReceived() include the default\\ncondition that invokes the inherited version of MessageReceived(). The\\nMyTextView version of MessageReceived() handles only the application-defined\\nFONT_TEST_MSG, yet a MyTextView object that is the focus view will also be\\nreceiving B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL messages. When the\\nMyTextView version of MessageReceived() encounters a message of one of\\nthese Be-defined types, it passes it on to the BTextView version of\\nMessageReceived() for handling.\\nIn this chapter\\'s previous two examples, TextView and TextViewEdit, the\\nMyDrawView class included a data member of type BTextView. Here I also\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\ninclude a data member in the MyDrawView class, but I change it to be of type\\nMyTextView:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyTextView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLike the previous example versions of the MyDrawView constructor, the TextViewFont project\\'s version of the MyDrawView constructor creates a text view object.\\nHere, however, the object is of the new MyTextView class type. Before exiting,\\nthe constructor calls the BTextView function SetStylable() to give the new\\nMyTextView object support for multiple character formats. That ensures that\\nchanges made to the MyTextView object\\'s text apply to only the current selection--not to all of the text in the object.\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new MyTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\nfTextView->SetStylable(true);\\n}\\n\\nScrolling\\nText or graphics your application uses may not always fit within the confines of a\\nview. Enter the scrollbar. The APIs for other operating systems that employ a\\ngraphical user interface include routines to work with scrollbars, but few implement this interface element as elegantly as the BeOS API does. The BScrollBar\\nclass makes it easy to add one or two scrollbars to any view. Better still, the\\nBScrollView class creates a bordered object with one or two BScrollBar\\nobjects already properly sized to fit any view you specify. Best of all, scrollbar\\noperation and updating is all automatic. Scrollbar objects are unique in that they\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\ndon\\'t receive drawing or mouse down messages--the Application Server intercepts these messages and responds accordingly.\\nAs part of the automatic handling of a scrollbar, the Application Server is responsible for changing the highlighting of a scrollbar. In Figure 8-11, you see the same\\nscrollbar with two different looks. When the contents of the view a scrollbar is\\nattached to exceed the size of the view, the scrollbar\\'s knob appears and the\\nscrollbar becomes enabled. As the content of the view increases, the scrollbar\\nknob automatically decreases in size to reflect the lessening amount of the total\\ntext being displayed within the view.\\n\\nFigure 8-11. A scrollbar\\'s look changes as the scrolled view\\'s content increases\\n\\nKeep in mind that from the ScrollBar preferences application the\\nuser can control the look and behavior of the scrollbars present in\\nall applications that run on his or her machine. For instance, the\\nScrollBar preferences control whether programs display a scrollbar\\nwith a pair of scroll arrows on each end, or just one. With that in\\nmind, you\\'ll note that the look of the scrollbars in this chapter\\'s figures differs (compare Figure 8-11 with Figure 8-13).\\n\\nScrollbars\\nTo make use of a scrollbar, create a BScrollBar object, designate a different view\\nto be the scrollbar\\'s target--the thing to be scrolled--and add the BScrollBar\\nobject to the same parent view as the target view. Or, more likely, create a\\nBScrollView object and let it do this work for you. Because the scrolling view is\\nso handy, the \"Scrolling\" section\\'s emphasis is on the BScrollView class. A\\nBScrollView object includes one or two BScrollBar objects, though, so a study\\nof the BScrollBar class won\\'t prove to be time wasted.\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nThe BScrollBar class\\nA scrollbar object is an instance of the BScrollBar class. Pass six arguments to its\\nconstructor, the prototype of which is shown here:\\nBScrollBar(BRect\\nframe,\\nconst char *name,\\nBView\\n*target,\\nfloat\\nmin,\\nfloat\\nmax,\\norientation posture)\\n\\nThe first parameter, frame, is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of the scrollbar. The coordinates of the rectangle are relative to the scrollbar\\'s parent view, not\\nto the thing that is to be scrolled. User interface guidelines state that scrollbars\\nshould be of a uniform thickness. That is, all horizontal scrollbars should be of the\\nsame height, and all vertical scrollbars should be of the same width. Use the Bedefined constants B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT and B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH to\\nensure that your program\\'s scrollbars have the same look as those used in other\\nBe applications. For instance, to set up the rectangle that defines a horizontal\\nscrollbar to run along the bottom of a text object, you might use this code:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nThe second parameter serves the same purpose as the name parameter in other\\nBView-derived classes: it allows the view to be accessed by name using the BView\\nfunction FindView().\\nA scrollbar acts on a target--a view associated with the scrollbar. The target is\\nwhat gets scrolled, and is typically an object that holds text or graphics. To bind a\\nscrollbar to the object to be scrolled, follow these steps:\\n1. Create the target object.\\n2. Add the target object to a view (its parent view).\\n3. Create a scrollbar object, using the target object as the target parameter in\\nthe BScrollBar constructor.\\n4. Add the scrollbar object to the view that serves as the target object\\'s parent.\\nFor a target that displays graphics, the min and max parameters determine how\\nmuch of the target view is displayable. The values you use for these two parameters will be dependent on the total size of the target. If the target view is a\\nBTextView object, the values assigned to min and max are inconsequential--the\\nscrollbar is always aware of how much text is currently in the target view and\\nadjusts itself accordingly. The exception is if both min and max are set to 0. In\\nsuch a case, the scrollbar is disabled and no knob is drawn, regardless of the target view\\'s contents. Refer to the \"Scrollbar range\" section just ahead for more\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\ndetails on choosing values for these two parameters when the target consists of\\ngraphics.\\nThe last parameter, posture, designates the orientation of the scrollbar. To create\\na horizontal scrollbar, pass the Be-defined constant B_HORIZONTAL. For a vertical\\nscrollbar, pass B_VERTICAL.\\nThe following snippet provides an example of a call to the BScrollBar constructor. Here a horizontal scrollbar is being created for use with a previously created\\nBTextView object named theTextView. Because the target is a text object, the\\nvalues of min and max are arbitrarily selected:\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*horizScrollBar;\\n50.0 + B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT);\\nmin = 1.0;\\nmax = 1.0;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar = new BScrollBar(scrollFrame, \"ScrollBar\", theTextView,\\nmin, max, B_HORIZONTAL);\\n\\nScrollbar example project\\nThis chapter\\'s TextView example project demonstrated how a window can support editable text through the use of a BTextView object. Because the topic of\\nscrollbars hadn\\'t been presented when TextView was developed, the program\\'s\\ntext view didn\\'t include them. Now you\\'re ready to add a vertical scrollbar, a horizontal scrollbar, or both to a text view. As shown in Figure 8-12, for the TextViewScrollBar project I\\'ve elected to add just a vertical scrollbar to the window\\'s\\nBTextView object.\\n\\nFigure 8-12. The TextViewScrollBar example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe TextView example project shows how to set up viewFrame and textBounds,\\nthe rectangles that define the boundary of the window\\'s BTextView object and\\nthe area that displays text in that object. Here I\\'ll discuss only the code that\\'s been\\nadded to the TextView project to turn it into the TextViewScrollBar project. All\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nthose additions appear in the MyDrawView constructor. The new code involves the\\ncreation of a vertical scrollbar, and appears following the call to InsetBy():\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*verticalBar;\\nscrollFrame;\\nmin = 1.0;\\nmax = 1.0;\\n\\nscrollFrame = viewFrame;\\nscrollFrame.left = scrollFrame.right;\\nscrollFrame.right = scrollFrame.left + B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\nverticalBar = new BScrollBar(scrollFrame, \"VerticalBar\", fTextView,\\nmin, max, B_VERTICAL);\\nAddChild(verticalBar);\\nverticalBar->SetResizingMode(B_FOLLOW_NONE);\\n}\\n\\nThe scrollbar will be added to the target\\'s parent view (MyDrawView), so the coordinates of the scrollbar\\'s rectangle are relative to the parent view, not to the target\\nview. The scrollFrame rectangle coordinates are first set to those of the target\\nview. That gives the scrollbar the same top and bottom coordinates as the target,\\nas desired. Then the scrollbar\\'s left and right side coordinates are adjusted so that\\nthe scrollbar lies flush on the right side of the target view. The scrollFrame rectangle is then used as the first parameter to the BScrollBar constructor. The previously created BTextView object fTextView is specified as the scrollbar\\'s target.\\nThe scrollbar is then added to MyDrawView, just as the target was previously\\nadded.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nGraphical user interface conventions dictate that a vertical scrollbar\\nbe located flush against the right side of the area that is scrollable,\\nand that a horizontal scrollbar be located flush against the bottom of\\nthe area that\\'s scrollable. But nothing in the BScrollBar class forces\\nyou to follow that convention. A scrollbar is associated with a view\\nto scroll by naming the view as the target in the BScrollBar constructor. Depending on the coordinates you choose for the frame\\nrectangle parameter of the BScrollBar constructor, the scrollbar\\ncan be placed anywhere in the parent view and it will still scroll the\\ncontents of the target view.\\n\\nNotice that in this example the resizing mode of the scrollbar is adjusted. The\\nBScrollBar constructor doesn\\'t include a sizing mode parameter. Instead, the\\nspecification of the scrolling bar\\'s orientation (the last parameter to the\\nBScrollBar constructor) defines a default behavior for the scrollbar. A vertically\\noriented scrollbar (like the one created here) resizes itself vertically. As the parent\\nview changes in size vertically, the vertical scrollbar will grow or shrink vertically.\\nAs the parent view changes in size horizontally, the vertical scrollbar will follow\\nthe parent view.\\nIn many cases these default characteristics are appropriate. In this project, they\\naren\\'t. I\\'ve given the BTextView object a resizing mode of B_FOLLOW_NONE, indicating that the text view object will remain a fixed size as the parent view changes\\nsize. In such a case, I want the target view\\'s scrollbar also to remain fixed in size\\nand location. A call to the BView function SetResizingMode() takes care of that\\ntask.\\nScrollbar range\\nIf a scrollbar\\'s target is a view that holds a graphical entity, such as a BView object\\nthat includes a BPicture object, the BScrollBar constructor min and max parameters take on significance. Together, min and max define a range that determines\\nhow much of the target view is displayable. Consider a view that is 250 pixels in\\nwidth and 200 pixels in height, and is to be displayed in a view that is 100 pixels\\nby 100 pixels in size. If this 100-by-100 pixel view has two scrollbars, and it\\'s\\ndesired that the user be able to scroll the entire view, the range of the horizontal\\nscrollbar should be 150 and the range of the vertical scrollbar should be 100.\\nFigure 8-13 illustrates this.\\nIn Figure 8-13, 100 pixels of the 250-pixel width of the view will always be displayed, so the horizontal range needs to be only 150 in order to allow the horizontal scrollbar to bring the remaining horizontal portions of the view through the\\ndisplay area. Similarly, 100 of the 200 vertical pixels will always be displayed in\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-13. An example of determining the range of a pair of scrollbars\\n\\nthe view, so the vertical range needs to be 100 in order to pass the remaining 100\\npixels through the display area. Assuming a graphics-holding view named\\ntheGraphicView, derived from a BView object, exists (as shown in Figure 8-13),\\nthe two scrollbars could be set up as shown in the following snippet. To see the\\nrelationship of the coordinates of the scrollbars to the view, refer to Figure 8-14.\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*horizScrollBar;\\n300.0 + B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT);\\nhorizMin =\\nhorizMax = 150.0;\\n*vertScrollBar;\\nvertMin =\\nvertMax = 100.0;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar = new BScrollBar(horizScrollFrame, \"HScrollBar\",\\ntheGraphicView,\\nhorizMin, horizMax, B_HORIZONTAL);\\nvertScrollBar = new BScrollBar(vertScrollFrame, \"VScrollBar\",\\ntheGraphicView,\\nvertMin, vertMax, B_VERTICAL);\\n\\nIf the target view changes size during program execution (for instance, your program may allow the user to replace the currently displayed contents of the view\\nwith different graphic), the range of any associated scrollbar should change, too.\\nThe BScrollBar function SetRange() exists for this purpose:\\nvoid SetRange(float\\nfloat\\n\\nmin,\\nmax)\\n\\nThe example just discussed has a horizontal scrollbar with a range of 0 to 150 pixels. If for some reason I wanted to allow the user to be able to scroll beyond the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-14. The coordinates of a pair of scrollbars and the picture to be scrolled\\n\\nright edge of the view, I could increase the scrollbar\\'s maximum value. Here I\\nchange the scrollbar\\'s range to allow the user to view 50 pixels of white space\\npast the view\\'s right edge:\\n\\nThe companion function to SetRange() is GetRange(). As expected, this function returns the current minimum and maximum scrolling values of a scrollbar:\\nvoid GetRange(float\\nfloat\\n\\n*min,\\n*max)\\n\\nIf this next snippet is executed after the preceding call to SetRange(), min should\\nhave a value of 0.0 and max should have a value of 200.0:\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nmin;\\nmax;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar->GetRange(&min, &max);\\n\\nThe ScrollViewPicture example near the end of this chapter provides an example\\nof setting the scrollbar range for a BView object that\\'s used as the target for a\\nBScrollView object--a view that has built-in scrollbars.\\n\\nScrolling View\\nIt\\'s a relatively easy assignment to add scrollbars to a view, as just demonstrated in\\nthe TextViewScrollBar project. However, the BeOS API makes it easier still. The\\nBScrollView class creates a scroll view object that serves as a container for\\nanother view. This contained view can hold either text (as a BTextView does) or\\ngraphics (as a BPicture does). Regardless of the content of its contained view,\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nthe BScrollView object is responsible for adding scrollbars that allow for scrolling through the entire content and for making itself the parent of the contained\\nview.\\nThe BScrollView class\\nThe seven parameters of the BScrollView constructor make it possible to create a\\nscrolling view object that has one, two, or even no scrollbars:\\nBScrollView(const char\\nBView\\nbool\\nbool\\nborder_style\\n\\n*name,\\n*target,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = 0,\\nhorizontal = false,\\nvertical = false,\\nborder = B_FANCY_BORDER)\\n\\nThe name, resizingMode, and flags parameters serve the purposes expected of\\na BView-derived class. The name parameter allows the scroll view object to be\\naccessed by its name. The resizingMode specifies how the object is to be resized\\nas the parent view changes size: the default value of B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP indicates that the distance from the scroll view\\'s left side and its\\nparent\\'s left side will be fixed, as will the distance from the scroll view\\'s top and\\nits parent\\'s top. The flags parameter specifies the notification the scroll view\\nobject is to receive. The default value of 0 means that the object isn\\'t to receive\\nany notification.\\nThe target parameter specifies the previously created view object to be surrounded by the scroll view object. The contents of the target view are what is to\\nbe scrolled. There\\'s no need to specify any size for the new scroll view object. It\\nwill automatically be given a framing rectangle that accommodates the target view,\\nany scrollbars that may be a part of the scroll view object, and a border (if\\npresent).\\nA scroll view object can have a horizontal scrollbar, a vertical scrollbar, both, or\\nneither. The horizontal and vertical parameters specify which scrollbar or\\nbars should be a part of the scroll view object. By default, the object includes no\\nscrollbars (meaning the object serves as nothing more than a way to draw a border around a different view, as discussed in the border parameter description\\nnext). To include a scrollbar, simply set the appropriate horizontal or vertical\\nparameter to true.\\nThe border parameter specifies the type of border to surround the scroll view\\nobject. By default, a scroll view object has a fancy border; the appearance of a\\ngroove surrounds the object. To specify a plain line border, pass the Be-defined\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nconstant B_PLAIN_BORDER as the last argument to the BScrollView constructor.\\nTo omit the border completely, pass B_NO_BORDER instead.\\nIn this next snippet, a scroll view object is created with a plain border and a vertical scrollbar. Here it\\'s assumed that theTextView is a BTextView object that isn\\'t\\nresizable. Because the target is fixed in the window in which it resides, the scroll\\nview too can be fixed. As evidenced by the value of the resizingMode parameter (B_FOLLOW_NONE), theScrollView won\\'t be resizeable:\\nBScrollView\\n\\n*theScrollView;\\n\\ntheScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", theTextView, B_FOLLOW_NONE,\\n0, false, true, B_PLAIN_BORDER);\\n\\nScroll view example project\\nThis chapter\\'s TextViewScrollBar project modified the TextView example project to\\ndemonstrate how a BScrollBar object can be used to scroll the contents of a\\nBTextView object. This latest project, ScrollViewText, achieves the same effect.\\nHere, however, a BScrollView object is used to create the BTextView object\\'s\\nscrollbar. The resulting window looks similar to the one generated by the TextViewScrollBar project (refer back to Figure 8-12). Thanks to the BScrollView,\\nhowever, here the border around the text view object has shading, as shown in\\nFigure 8-15.\\n\\nFigure 8-15. The ScrollViewText example program\\'s window\\n\\nWhile the results of the TextViewScrollBar and ScrollView Text projects are similar, the effort expended to obtain the results differs. Using a BScrollView object\\nto supply the scrollbar (as done here) rather than using a BScrollBar object\\nmeans there\\'s no need to supply the scrollbar\\'s coordinates. The BScrollView\\nobject takes care of the scrollbar\\'s placement based on the location of the designated target. Additionally, there\\'s no need to draw a border around the text view;\\nthe BScrollBar object takes care of that task too.\\nThe MyDrawView class declaration is the same as it was for the original TextView\\nproject, with the addition of a BScrollView object:\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor holds the scroll view code:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView, B_FOLLOW_NONE,\\n0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n}\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor begins by setting up and creating a BTextView\\nobject. This code is the same as the code that appears in the TextView version of\\nthe MyDrawView constructor, with one exception. Here, a call to AddChild()\\ndoesn\\'t immediately follow the creation of the text view object. The newly created\\nBTextView object isn\\'t added to the drawing view because it is instead added to\\nthe BScrollView object when it is passed to the scroll view\\'s constructor. The\\nBScrollView object is then added to the drawing view. When the program creates a window, that window\\'s view hierarchy will look like the one pictured in\\nFigure 8-16. In this figure, you see that the BScrollView object fScrollView is\\nthe parent to two views: the target view fMyTextView and a BScrollBar object\\ncreated by the BScrollView constructor. Later, in the ScrollViewPicture project,\\nyou\\'ll see how your code can easily access this implicitly created scrollbar.\\nThe implementation of this project\\'s AttachedToWindow() function is identical to\\nthe TextView projects: call SetFont() and SetFontSize() to specify font information for the drawing view, then call fTextView->MakeFocus() to start the cursor blinking in the BTextView object. The implementation of Draw() is simple--\\nhere it\\'s an empty function. In the TextView project, StrokeRect() was invoked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 8-16.

Typically, a simple text editor displays a resizable window bordered by a vertical scrollbar and possibly a horizontal scrollbar. Figure 8-17 shows such a window--the window displayed by the\\nScrollViewWindow project.\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-17. The ScrollViewWindow example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe ScrollViewWindow project includes only slight modifications to the TextViewScrollBar project. All the changes are found in the MyDrawView constructor:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect viewFrame;\\nBRect textBounds;\\nviewFrame = Bounds();\\nviewFrame.right -= B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, 0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n}\\n\\nA call to the BView function Bounds() sets the coordinates of what is to be the\\nBScrollView target, the BTextView view object, to the coordinates of the drawing view. The drawing view itself is the same size as the content area of the window it resides in, so this brings me close to my goal of making the entire content\\narea of the window capable of holding user-entered text. The exception is that\\nroom needs to be allowed for the vertical scrollbar. Subtracting the width of this\\nscrollbar results in a viewFrame rectangle with the desired size.\\nThe other changes to the MyDrawView constructor involve the resizingMode\\nparameter to both the BTextView constructor and the BScrollView constructor.\\nIn the previous example, the scroll view was fixed in size, so neither the scroll\\nview nor its target needed to be concerned with resizing. Here I want the text area\\nof the window to always occupy the entire content area of the window, less\\nthe window\\'s scrollbar area. A resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL (rather than\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE) tells both the BScrollView object and its BTextView target that\\nthey should automatically resize themselves as the user changes the parent window\\'s size.\\nAccessing a BScrollView scrollbar\\nThe BScrollView constructor lets you specify whether a BScrollView object\\nshould include a horizontal scrollbar, a vertical scrollbar, or both. The constructor\\nis responsible for creating the appropriate number of BScrollBar objects and\\nplacing them within the BScrollView object. The BScrollView constructor gives\\neach of its BScrollBar objects a default range of 0.0 to 1000.0. If the\\nBScrollView object\\'s target is a BTextView, these default minimum and maximum values always suffice--the BTextView object makes sure that the ranges of\\nthe scrollbars that target it are adjusted accordingly. If the BScrollView object\\'s\\ntarget is instead a view that holds graphics, you\\'ll need to adjust the range of each\\nscrollbar so that the user is guaranteed visual access to the entire target view.\\nThis chapter\\'s \"Scrollbar range\" section describes how to determine the range for a\\nscrollbar to scroll graphics, as well as how to use the BScrollBar function\\nSetRange() to set a scrollbar\\'s minimum and maximum values. After determining\\nthe range a scroll view object\\'s scrollbar should have, invoke the BScrollView\\nfunction ScrollBar() to gain access to the scrollbar in question. Pass\\nScrollBar() the type of scrollbar (B_HORIZONTAL or B_VERTICAL) to access,\\nand the routine returns the BScrollBar object. Then invoke that object\\'s\\nSetRange() function to reset its range. Here, access to the vertical scrollbar of a\\nBScrollView object named theScrollView is gained, and the scrollbar\\'s range is\\nthen set to a minimum of 0.0 and a maximum of 340.0:\\nBScrollBar\\n\\n*scrollBar;\\n\\nscrollBar = theScrollView->ScrollBar(B_VERTICAL);\\n\\nScrollbar access example project\\nWhile topics such as the BStringView class and the BTextView class have made\\nthe display of text the focus of this chapter, I\\'ll close with an example that demonstrates how to scroll a picture. The BScrollView class (covered later in this section) places no restrictions on what type of view is to be the designated target, so\\nthe differences between scrolling text and scrolling graphics are minimal. As\\nshown in Figure 8-18, the ScrollViewPicture project demonstrates how to use a\\nBPicture object as the target of a BScrollView object.\\nThis example would work just fine with a very simple picture, such as one created by drawing a single large rectangle. I\\'ve opted to instead create a slightly\\nmore complex picture, and at the same time set up the project such that it\\'s an\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-18. The ScrollViewPicture example program\\'s window\\n\\neasy task to make the picture far more complex. I\\'ve done that by creating a\\nBView-derived class named MyPictureView. The declaration of this new class\\nappears in the MyPictureView.h header file, while the implementations of the class\\nmember functions can be found in MyPictureView.cpp. Here\\'s the MyPictureView\\ndeclaration:\\nclass MyPictureView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBPicture\\n\\nMyPictureView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPicture;\\n\\n};\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see in this example, a MyPictureView object will become the target of a\\nBScrollView object. That means the MyPictureView class could include any\\nnumber of graphics, and the scroll view object will view them all as a single entity.\\nSo while I\\'ve included a single BPicture data member in the MyPictureView,\\nyour BView-derived class could hold two, three, or three hundred pictures, along\\nwith other graphic data members such as polygons or bitmaps (see Chapter 5 for\\nshape-drawing information and Chapter 10, Files, for bitmap details).\\nThe AttachedToWindow() routine sets up the picture. Recall that such code can\\'t\\nappear in the constructor of the picture\\'s parent view. That\\'s because the\\nBPicture definition relies on the current state of the picture\\'s parent view, and\\nthe parent view\\'s state isn\\'t completely set up until the execution of\\nAttachedToWindow().\\nvoid MyPictureView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i=0; i<100; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\n}\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that your own BView class could contain more\\nthan one BPicture data member. Looking at the above version of\\nAttachedToWindow(), you might think that\\'s unnecessary because\\nyou can define a single BPicture object to include all the graphics\\na view needs. That may be the case--or it may not be. Your program might construct a BView-derived class by piecing together multiple BPicture objects. For instance, your application may give the\\nuser the opportunity to define a single large graphic by selecting\\nnumerous small pictures.\\n\\nThe BScrollView object will exist in a MyDrawView object, and will have a\\nBScrollView object as its target. I\\'ve included MyPictureView and\\nBScrollView data members in the MyDrawView class to keep track of these\\nobjects.\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyPictureView\\nBScrollView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPictureView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor begins by creating what will be the target view:\\nfPictureView. Next, it creates a BScrollView object with fPictureView as the\\ntarget. After adding the scroll view to the drawing view, the default ranges of the\\nscroll view\\'s two scrollbars are altered. Looking back at the MyPictureView version of AttachedToWindow(), you\\'ll note that the BPicture object will be 300\\npixels wide and 300 pixels high. Yet the width and height of the viewFrame rectangle that is to display this picture are each only 100 pixels. The difference in the\\nactual size of the picture and the size of the rectangle the picture\\'s displayed in is\\nused in resetting the scrollbar ranges:\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nfPictureView = new MyPictureView(viewFrame, \"MyPictureView\");\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fPictureView,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, 0, true, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\nBScrollBar\\n\\n*scrollBar;\\n\\nscrollBar = fScrollView->ScrollBar(B_VERTICAL);\\nscrollBar = fScrollView->ScrollBar(B_HORIZONTAL);\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nMessages and Threads\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n The Application Kit\\nand Messages\\n Application-Defined\\nMessages\\n\\n9.\\n\\nSeveral years ago Be, Inc. set out to develop a new operating system--one they\\neventually dubbed the Media OS. The goal was to create an operating system that\\ncould keep up with the computationally intensive demands of media professionals who routinely worked with complex and resource-hungry graphics and audio\\nfiles. From the start, Be knew that threads and messages would be of paramount\\nimportance. A multithreaded environment means that a single application can\\nsimultaneously carry out multiple tasks. On a single-processor machine, CPU idle\\ntime is reduced as the processor services one thread followed by another. On a\\nmultiprocessor machine, task time really improves as different CPUs can be dedicated to the servicing of different threads.\\nThreads can be considered roadways that allow the system to communicate with\\nan object, one object to communicate with another object, and even one application to communicate with another application. Continuing with the analogy, messages are the vehicles that carry the information, or data, that is to be passed from\\none entity to another. Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, introduced messages, and seldom since then have a couple of pages passed without a direct or\\nindirect reference to messages. In this chapter, I\\'ll formally explain of how messages and threads work. In doing so, you\\'ll see how your application can create its\\nown messages and use them to let one object tell another object what to do. You\\'ll\\nsee how sending a message can trigger an object to perform some desired action.\\nYou\\'ll also see how a message can be filled with any manner of data before it\\'s\\nsent. Once received, the recipient object has access to any and all of the data held\\nwithin the message.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nThe Application Kit and Messages\\nServers are background processes that exist to serve the basic, low-level needs of\\napplications. The BeOS end user makes indirect use of servers every time he or\\nshe runs a Be application. As a Be programmer, you make more direct use of servers by using the BeOS application programming interface. The classes of the API\\nare organized into the software kits that have been discussed at length throughout\\nthis book. The most basic, and perhaps most important, of these kits is the Application Kit. Among the classes defined in this kit is the BApplication class. Your\\napplication begins by creating a BApplication object. When an instance of that\\nclass is created, your application connects to the Application Server, and can make\\nuse of all the services provided by that server. Tasks handled by the Application\\nServer include the provision of windows, the handling of the interaction between\\nthese windows, and the monitoring and reporting of user events such as mouse\\nbutton clicks. In short, the Application Server, and indirectly the classes of the\\nApplication Kit, allow the system to communicate with an application. This communication takes place via messages that travel by way of threads.\\nThe classes of the Application Kit (shown in Figure 9-1) fall into the four categories listed below. Of these groupings, it\\'s messaging that\\'s the focus of this chapter.\\nMessaging\\nThe Application Server delivers system messages to an application. Additionally, an application can send application-defined messages to itself (the purpose being to pass information from one object to another). The Application\\nKit defines a number of message-related classes that are used to create,\\ndeliver, and handle these messages. Among these classes are: BMessage,\\nBLooper, and BHandler.\\nBApplication class\\nAn application\\'s single BApplication object is the program\\'s interface to the\\nApplication Server.\\nBRoster class\\nThe system keeps a roster, or list, of all executing applications. Upon the\\nlaunch of your application, a BRoster object is automatically created. In the\\nevent that your program needs to communicate with other running applications, it can do so by accessing this BRoster object.\\nBClipboard class\\nThe system keeps a single clipboard as a repository for information that can\\nbe shared--via copying, cutting, and pasting--between objects in an application and between distinct applications. Upon launch, your application automatically creates a BClipboard object that is used to access the systemwide\\nclipboard.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBRoster\\nBRoster\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nBApplication\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nBWindow\\n\\nBMessenger\\nBMessageFiller\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBMessageQueue\\n\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 9-1. The inheritance hierarchy for the Application Kit\\n\\nMessaging\\nThe Application Kit defines the classes that allow an application to be multithreaded. While threads run independently, they do need a means of communicating with one another. So the Application Kit also defines classes that allow for the\\ncreation and delivery of messages.\\nThe BMessage class is used to create message objects. A single message can contain as little or as much information as appropriate for its purpose. Once created\\nwithin one thread, a message can be delivered to the same thread, a different\\nthread in the same application, or to a thread in a different application altogether.\\nHow a thread obtains a message and then handles that message is determined by\\nthe Application Kit classes BLooper and BHandler. A BLooper object runs a message loop in a thread. This message loop receives messages and dispatches each\\nto a BHandler object. The handler object is responsible for handling the message\\nas appropriate for the message type. Notice in Figure 9-1 that the BLooper class is\\nderived from the BHandler class. This means that a looper object is also a handler object, and can thus pass a message to itself. While this may sound selfdefeating, it actually serves as a quite useful mechanism for initiating and carrying\\nout a task from within one object, such as a window (which, as shown in\\nFigure 9-1, is both a looper and a handler). Throughout this chapter you\\'ll see several examples of the creating of messages and the dispatching of these messages\\nboth by the object that created them and by other objects.\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nBecause an application is multithreaded, more than one thread may attempt to\\naccess the same data. For read-only data (data that can\\'t be written to or altered),\\nthat\\'s not a problem. For read-write data, a problem could exist; if both accessing\\nobjects try to alter the same data at the same time, the result will be at best unpredictable and at worst disastrous. To prevent simultaneous data access, the BeOS\\nallows for the locking of data. When one thread is about to access data, it can first\\nlock it. While locked, other threads are prevented access. When a thread encounters locked data, it finds itself waiting in queue. Only after the thread that locked\\nthe data later unlocks it will other threads get a chance at access.\\nIn many instances, the locking and unlocking of data is handled by the system.\\nFor instance, when a window receives a message (when a message enters the window thread\\'s message loop), the BWindow object is locked until the message is\\nhandled. From Chapter 4 you know that a window object has a host of characteristics, such as size, that can be altered at runtime. If the window wasn\\'t locked during message handling, and the message indicated that, say, the window should be\\nresized, the possibility exists for a second such message to arrive at the same time\\nand also attempt to change the values of the window object\\'s screen coordinates.\\nOccasionally there\\'ll be cases where your application is responsible for the locking and unlocking of data. For such occasions, the object to be locked will have\\nLock() and Unlock() member functions in its class definition. This chapter provides one such instance of manually locking and unlocking an object. If your program wants to add data to the clipboard (as opposed to the user placing it there\\nby a copy or cut), it should first lock the clipboard (in case the user does in fact\\nperform a copy or cut while your program is in the process of placing data on the\\nclipboard!). This chapter\\'s ClipboardMessage project shows how this is done.\\n\\nApplication Kit Classes\\nThe previous section described the Application Kit classes directly involved with\\nmessages--the BMessage, BLooper, and BHandler classes. Other Application Kit\\nclasses, while not as important in terms of messaging, are still noteworthy. Be suggests that the collective message-related classes make up one of four Application\\nKit categories. The other three each contain a single class--BApplication,\\nBRoster, and BClipboard class. Those three classes are discussed next.\\nBApplication class\\nBy now you\\'re quite familiar with the notion that every program must create a single instance of the BApplication class (or of an application-defined\\nBApplication-derived class). The BApplication class is derived from the\\nBLooper class, so an object of this class type runs its own message loop. A program\\'s application object is connected to the Application Server, and system\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nmessages sent to the program enter the application object\\'s message loop. If a\\nmessage is a system message (such as a B_QUIT_REQUESTED), it is eventually handled by a BApplication hook function (such as QuitRequested()). The\\nBApplication class defines a MessageReceived() function that augments the\\nBHandler version of this routine. If your program wants the application object to\\nhandle application-defined messages, it should override and augment the\\nBApplication version MessageReceived(). To do that, your program defines a\\nmessage constant, declares MessageReceived() in the BApplication-derived\\nclass declaration, and implements MessageReceived():\\n#define\\n\\nMY_APP_DEFINED_MSG\\n\\n\\'mymg\\'\\n\\nclass MyAppClass : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyAppClass();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nvoid MyAppClass::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MY_APP_DEFINED_MSG:\\n// handle this type of message\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\ninherited::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPrevious example projects haven\\'t made direct use of MessageReceived() in the\\napplication object. This chapter\\'s AlertMessage project (discussed in the \"Messageposting example project\" section) provides a specific example.\\n\\nLike the BApplication class, the BWindow class is derived from\\nBLooper. So, like an application object, a window object runs a\\nmessage loop. And, again like an application object, a window\\nobject has a connection to the Application Server--so a window can\\nbe the recipient of system messages. Examples of these interface system messages include B_QUIT_REQUESTED, B_ZOOM, B_MOUSE_DOWN,\\nB_KEY_DOWN, and B_WINDOW_RESIZED messages.\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nBRoster class\\nThe system, of course, keeps track of all running applications. Some of the information about these processes is stored in a roster, or table, in memory. Much of\\nthis information about other executing applications is available to your executing\\napplication. Your program won\\'t access this roster directly, though. Instead, it will\\nrely on the be_roster global variable. When an application launches, an object of\\nthe BRoster class is automatically created and assigned to be_roster.\\nTo garner information about or communicate via messages with another application, you simply refer to be_roster and invoke one of the BRoster member\\nfunctions. Some of the important BRoster functions and their purposes include:\\nGetAppList()\\nReturns an identifier for each running application.\\nGetAppInfo()\\nProvides information about a specified application.\\nActivateApp()\\nActivates an already running application by bringing one of its windows to the\\nfront and activating it.\\nBroadcast()\\nBroadcasts, or sends, a message to all currently running applications.\\nIsRunning()\\nDetermines if a specified application is currently running.\\nLaunch()\\nLocates an application on disk and launches it.\\nFindApp()\\nLocates an application (as Launch() does), but doesn\\'t launch it.\\nOne of the ways be_roster identifies an application is by the program\\'s signature (presenting you with another reason to make sure your application\\'s signature is unique--as mentioned in Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects). The very simple RosterCheck example project in this chapter takes advantage of this in order to see\\nhow many instances of the RosterCheck program are currently running. RosterCheck allows itself to be launched more than once, but not more than twice.\\n\\nWhen creating an application that is to allow for multiple instances\\nof the program, you need make sure that the application flags field\\nresource is set to multiple launch. Chapter 2 discusses this resource\\nand how to set it. In short, you double-click on the project\\'s\\nresource file to open it, then click the Multiple Launch radio button\\nin the Application Flags section.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nThe roster keeps track of each application that is running, including multiple\\ninstances of the same application. To check the roster and make use of the results,\\njust a few lines of code in the application constructor are all that\\'s needed:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\")\\n{\\nBList theList;\\nlong\\nnumApps;\\nbe_roster->GetAppList(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\", &theList);\\nnumApps = theList.CountItems();\\nif (numApps > 2) {\\nPostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn;\\n}\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nWhen passed an application signature and a pointer to a BList object, the\\nBRoster function GetAppList() examines the roster and fills in the list object\\nwith an item for each currently running application with the matching signature.\\nTo know what to do next, you need at least a passing familiarity with the BList\\nclass, a class not yet mentioned in this book.\\nThe BList class is a part of the Support Kit, which defines datatypes, classes, and\\nutilities any application can use. An instance of the BList class is used to hold a\\nlist of data pointers in an orderly fashion. Keeping data in a BList is handy\\nbecause you can then use existing BList member functions to further organize or\\nmanipulate the data. The partial listing of the BList class hints at the things a list\\ncan do:\\nclass BList {\\npublic:\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nBList(const BList&);\\n~BList();\\n\\nBList\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\n&operator=(const BList &from);\\nAddItem(void *item);\\nAddItem(void *item, int32 atIndex);\\nAddList(BList *newItems);\\nAddList(BList *newItems, int32 atIndex);\\nRemoveItem(void *item);\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\nbool\\nvoid\\n\\nReplaceItem(int32 index, void *newItem);\\nMakeEmpty();\\n\\nvoid\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nSortItems(int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *));\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\n*FirstItem() const;\\n*LastItem() const;\\n*Items() const;\\n\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nHasItem(void *item) const;\\nIndexOf(void *item) const;\\nCountItems() const;\\nIsEmpty() const;\\n\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\nThe pointers that are stored in a list can reference any type of data, so the\\nBRoster function GetAppList() stores a reference to each running application\\nwith the specified signature. After calling GetAppList() you can find out how\\nmany instances of the application in question are currently running--just invoke\\nCountItems() to see how many items are in the list. That\\'s exactly what I do in\\nthe RosterCheck project:\\nBList\\nlong\\n\\ntheList;\\nnumApps;\\n\\nbe_roster->GetAppList(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\", &theList);\\nnumApps = theList.CountItems();\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, numApps holds the number of executing instances\\nof the RosterCheck program (including the instance that\\'s just been launched and\\nis executing the above code). The following code limits the number of times the\\nuser can execute RosterCheck to two; if you try to launch RosterCheck a third\\ntime, the program will immediately quit:\\nif (numApps > 2) {\\nPostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn;\\n}\\n\\nA more well-behaved version of RosterCheck would post an alert explaining why\\nthe program quit. It would also have some reason for limiting the number of\\ninstances of the program--my arbitrary limit of two exists so that I can demonstrate that the roster in general, and a BRoster member function in particular,\\nwork!\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBClipboard class\\nThe previous section described the system\\'s application roster, the be_roster global object used to access the roster, and the BRoster class that defines the type of\\nobject be_roster is. The clipboard works in a similar vein: there\\'s one system\\nclipboard, it\\'s accessed by a be_clipboard global object, and that object is of the\\nBe class BClipboard.\\nObjects of some class types make use of be_clipboard without any intervention\\non your part. For instance, in Chapter 8, Text, you saw that a BTextView object\\nautomatically supports the editing functions cut, copy, paste, and select all. When\\nthe user cuts text from a BTextView object, the object places that text on the system clipboard. Because this clipboard is global to the system, the cut data\\nbecomes available to both the application from which the data was cut and any\\nother application that supports the pasting of data.\\nAs you may suspect, when editing takes place in a BTextView object, messages\\nare involved. In particular, the BTextView object responds to B_CUT, B_COPY,\\nB_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL messages. The B_CUT and B_COPY messages add to\\nthe clipboard the currently selected text in the text view object that\\'s the focus\\nview. The B_PASTE message retrieves text from the clipboard and pastes it to the\\ninsertion point in the text view object that\\'s the focus view. If you want your program to manually force other text to be added to the clipboard, or if you want\\nyour program to manually retrieve the current text from the clipboard without\\npasting it anywhere, you can do so by directly accessing the clipboard.\\nTo fully appreciate how to work with the clipboard, you\\'ll want to read this chapter\\'s \"Working with BMessage Objects\" section. In particular, the \"Data, messages,\\nand the clipboard\" subsection discusses messages as they pertain to the clipboard,\\nand the \"Clipboard example project\" subsection provides an example of adding\\ntext directly to the clipboard without any intervention on the part of the user.\\n\\nApplication-Defined Messages\\nUp to this point, you\\'ve dealt mostly with system messages--messages generated\\nand dispatched by the system. The Message Protocols appendix of the Be Book\\ndefines all the system messages. In short, system messages fall into the following\\ncategories:\\nApplication system messages\\nSuch a message concerns the application itself, and is delivered to the\\nBApplication object. The application handles the message by way of a hook\\nfunction, as described in Chapter 4. B_QUIT_REQUESTED is one application\\nmessage with which you\\'re familiar.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nInterface system messages\\nSuch a message concerns a single window, and is delivered to a BWindow\\nobject. The window handles the message by way of a hook function, or, if the\\nmessage affects a view in the window, passes it on to the BView object, which\\nhandles it by way of a hook function. A B_WINDOW_ACTIVATED message is an\\nexample of an interface message that would be handled by a window, while a\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN message is an example of an interface message that would be\\npassed on to a view (the view the cursor was over at the time of the mouse\\nbutton click) for handling.\\nStandard messages\\nSuch a message is produced by either the system or application, but isn\\'t handled by means of a hook function. The editing messages covered in\\nChapter 8B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALLare examples of\\nstandard messages. When a user selects text in a BTextView object and\\npresses Command-x, the affected window generates a B_CUT message that is\\nsent to the text view object. That object automatically handles the text cutting\\nby invoking the BTextView function Cut().\\nThe system and standard messages are important to making things happen in your\\napplication--they allow the user to interact with your program. But these messages are only a part of the powerful Be messaging system. Your application is\\nalso free to define its own message constants, create messages of these application-defined types, add data to these messages, and then pass the messages on to\\nother object or even other applications.\\n\\nMessage Handling\\nAn application-defined message can be issued automatically in response to a user\\naction such as a menu item selection or a control activation. Your application can\\nalso issue, or post, a message explicitly without any user intervention. Before\\ngoing into the details of application-defined messages, a quick review of system\\nmessages will minimize confusion between how these different types of messages\\nare handled.\\nSystem message handling\\nWhen an application receives a system message, it is dispatched by sending the\\nmessage to the affected BHandler object. That object then invokes a hook function--a function specifically implemented to handle one particular type of system\\nmessage.\\nA system message is the result of an action external to the application. The message is generated by the operating system, and is delivered to an application\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nobject or a window object. That object, or an object the message is subsequently\\npassed to, invokes the appropriate hook function.\\nAs an example, consider a mouse button click. The click of a mouse button\\ninspires the Application Server to generate a B_MOUSE_DOWN message. The server\\npasses this message to the affected window (the window under the cursor at the\\ntime of the mouse button click). A BWindow object is a looper, so the window has\\nits own thread that runs a message loop. From this loop, the message is dispatched to a handler, which in this example is the affected view (the view under\\nthe cursor at the time of the mouse button click). A BView object is a handler, so it\\ncan be the recipient of a passed message. A handler object in general, and a\\nBView-derived object in particular, has its own hook functions (either inherited\\nfrom the BView class or overridden). For a B_MOUSE_DOWN message, the pertinent\\nfunction the view invokes is the BView hook function MouseDown(). Figure 9-2\\nillustrates system message dispatching for this situation.\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-2. A message moves from the Application Server to a view\\n\\nIn Figure 9-2, you see that the window invokes a function named\\nDispatchMessage(). This is a BLooper function that BWindow augments (overrides in order to add window-specific functionality, and then invokes the inherited version as well). DispatchMessage() is responsible for forwarding a system\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nmessage to the affected view. While your application can override\\nDispatchMessage(), it should seldom need to. Similarly, while\\nDispatchMessage() can be invoked directly, it\\'s best to leave the timing of the\\ncall to the system. Leave it to the looper object (whether the application or a window) to automatically use this message-forwarding routine as it sees fit. In this\\nexample, DispatchMessage() will make sure that the BView object\\'s version of\\nthe hook function MouseDown() is invoked.\\nChapter 4 provided a variety of examples that demonstrated system message handling, including B_MOUSE_DOWN and B_KEY_DOWN messages. If you refer back to\\nany of these examples, you\\'ll see that each uses a hook function.\\nApplication-defined message handling and implicitly generated messages\\nAn application-defined message isn\\'t handled by means of a hook function. The\\nvery fact that your application defines the message means that no pre-existing\\nhook function could be included in whatever BHandler-derived class the recipient object belongs to. Instead, an application-defined message is always dispatched by way of a call to MessageReceived(). The looper object that receives\\nthe message passes it to a handler object, which uses its version of\\nMessageReceived() to carry out the message\\'s action. That leads to the distinction that a system message is usually handled by a hook function (some systemgenerated messages, such as the standard messages resulting from text edits, need\\nto be handled by a version of MessageReceived()), while an application-defined\\nmessage is always handled by a MessageReceived() function.\\nYou\\'ve seen several examples of how an application works with applicationdefined messages--most notably in the chapters that deal with controls and menus\\n(Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, and Chapter 7, Menus). For instance, a program that implements message handling through a menu item first defines a message constant:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_ADV_HELP_MSG\\n\\n\\'help\\'\\n\\nThe program then includes this message constant in the creation of a new\\nBMessage object--as is done here as part of the process of creating a new\\nBMenuItem:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Advanced Help\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG)));\\n\\nFinally, the message constant appears in a case section in the BWindow object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function--as in this snippet:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\ncase MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG:\\nOpenHelpWindow(MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG);\\nbreak;\\n// other case sections here\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nLike a system message, an application-defined message relies on the BLooperinherited function DispatchMessage() to transfer the application-defined message from the looper to the handler. Again, your code shouldn\\'t ever have to redefine DispatchMessage() or invoke it directly. As shown in Figure 9-3, in this\\nexample the BWindow object is both the looper and handler. The menu item\\ngenerated message is placed in the window\\'s message loop, and the window\\nobject sends the message to itself and invokes the window\\'s version of\\nMessageReceived() via the BWindow version of DispatchMessage().\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nMENU_ADV_HELP_MSG\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-3. A message moves from a window back to that window\\n\\nWhile the window generates the message and delivers it to itself, the\\nApplication Server may play a role in the act. This is most evident\\nfor a message generated by a menu item or control. In each case,\\nthe Application Server inserts when data into the message so the\\napplication knows at what instant the event (generally a mouse button click) that initiated the message occurred.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nApplication-defined message handling and explicitly generated messages\\nA user request, such as menu item selection or control activation, is one way an\\napplication-defined message gets generated and MessageReceived() gets\\ninvoked. In this case, the message is created and passed automatically. You may\\nencounter other instances where it\\'s appropriate for one object in a program to\\nreceive information, or take some action, based on circumstances other than a user\\naction. To do that, your program can have an object (such as a window) create a\\nmessage object, and then have that message posted to a looper object.\\nAs an example, consider a window that needs to pass some information to the\\napplication. Perhaps the window is performing some lengthy task, and it wants the\\napplication to know when the task is completed. The window could create a\\nBMessage object and send it to the application. In a simple case, the arrival of the\\nmessage might be enough information for the application. However, a message\\ncan contain any amount of information, so a more sophisticated example might\\nhave the message holding information about the completed task, such as the\\nlength of time it took to execute the task.\\nWhen PostMessage() is called, the specified message is delivered to the looper\\nthe function is called upon. You\\'ve seen this in all of the example projects to this\\npoint. When the user clicks on a window\\'s close button, the window\\'s\\nQuitRequested() hook function is invoked. In that function, the application\\nobject invokes PostMessage(). Here the application object acts as a looper to\\npost the message, then acts as a handler to dispatch the message to its\\nMessageReceived() function:\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nA message posted to a looper via a call to PostMessage() gets delivered, or dispatched, via the DispatchMessage() function. When it comes time to send a\\nmessage, the sender (the looper object) calls PostMessage(). PostMessage() in\\nturn calls DispatchMessage(). In the above version of QuitRequested(), the\\nmessage posted is a Be-defined message, but that needn\\'t be the case--it could be\\nan application-defined one. In such a case, an object such as a window would create the message using new and the BMessage constructor (as discussed ahead). If\\nthe message was to be delivered to the application, the message could then be\\nposted just as it was in QuitRequested(). Figure 9-4 illustrates the process.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBApplication\\nobject\\n\\nnew BMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nnew BMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nBApplication\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-4. A message moves from a window to the application\\n\\nWorking with BMessage Objects\\nThe preceding section served as an introduction to how an application might create a message object and send it to another object. That section was just that--an\\nintroduction. Here you\\'ll see the details--and code--for creating, posting, and\\nhandling BMessage objects.\\nCreating a message\\nThe BMessage constructor has a single parameter--a uint32 value represents the\\nnew message object\\'s command constant. System message command constants\\nalways begin with B_, as in B_QUIT_REQUESTED and B_MOUSE_DOWN, so to be\\nquickly recognized as an application-defined message, your application-defined\\ncommand constants should begin with any other combination of characters. Additionally, each system message\\'s command constant is defined to be a four-character string that consists of only uppercase characters and, optionally, underscore\\ncharacters. Defining an application-defined message by any other scheme (such as\\nusing all lowercase characters) ensures that the message won\\'t be misinterpreted\\nas a system message. Here\\'s an example of the creation of a BMessage object:\\n#define\\n\\nWAGER_MSG\\n\\n\\'wger\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nfirstRaceWagerMsg = new BMessage(WAGER_MSG);\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nThe BMessage constructor sets the what data member of the new message object\\nto the value of the command parameter. As you\\'ve seen, it\\'s the value of what\\nthat\\'s used by MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WAGER_MSG:\\n// handle message;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nA message always has a command constant, and it may include data. Regardless of\\nwhether a message holds data, it\\'s posted to a looper, and dispatched to a handler, in the same way. The firstRaceWagerMsg consists of nothing more than a\\ncommand constant, but it is nonetheless a complete message. So before increasing the complexity of message-related discussions by examining how data is\\nadded to and extracted from a message object, let\\'s use the simple message to see\\nhow a message is posted to a looper and then dispatched to a handler.\\nPosting and dispatching a message\\nOnce created, a message needs to be placed in the message loop of a looper\\'s\\nthread and then delivered to a handler. The looper is an object of the BLooper\\nclass or an object of a BLooper-derived class, such as the application object or a\\nwindow object. The handler is an object of the BHandler class or an object of a\\nBHandler-derived class, such as, again, the application object or a window object\\n(refer back to Figure 9-1 to see the pertinent part of the BeOS API class hierarchy). A call to PostMessage() places a message in the queue of the looper\\nwhose PostMessage() function is called, and optionally specifies the handler to\\nwhich the message is to be delivered. This BLooper member function has the following parameter list:\\nstatus_t PostMessage(BMessage\\nBHandler\\nBHandler\\n\\n*message,\\n*handler,\\n*replyHandler = NULL)\\n\\nThe first parameter, message, is the BMessage object to post. The second parameter, handler, names the target handler--the BHandler object to which the message is to be delivered. The replyHandler, which is initialized to NULL, is of\\ninterest only if the target handler object is going to reply to the message (more\\ntypically the target handler simply handles the message and doesn\\'t return any\\ntype of reply). While the poster of the message and the target of the message don\\'t\\nhave to be one and the same, they can be--as shown in this snippet (read the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\n\"Menu Items and Message Dispatching\" sidebar for a look at how previous example projects have been doing this):\\n#define\\n\\nWAGER_MSG\\n\\n\\'wger\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nfirstRaceWagerMsg = new BMessage(WAGER_MSG);\\n\\ntheWindow->PostMessage(firstRaceWagerMsg, theWindow);\\n\\nA posted message is placed in the looper\\'s message queue, where it takes its place\\nbehind (possibly) other messages in the queue in preparation to be delivered to\\nthe target handler object. The looper object continually checks its queue and calls\\nthe BLooper function DispatchMessage() for the next message in the queue.\\nWhen your posted message becomes the next in the queue, the looper invokes\\nDispatchMessage() to pass the message to the target handler. The effect is for\\nthe posted message to reach the target handler\\'s MessageReceived() function. If\\nthat routine has a case label that matches the message\\'s what data member, the\\nhandler acts on the message. Since the above code names a window as both the\\nlooper and the target handler, the window must have a MessageReceived()\\nfunction set up to take care of a message of type WAGER_MSG (if it doesn\\'t, the program won\\'t fail--the posted message simply isn\\'t acted upon):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WAGER_MSG:\\n// handle message;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe BLooper class provides another way to call PostMessage()--a sort of shorthand method that in many cases saves you the (admittedly simple) step of creating a BMessage object. Instead of passing a BMessage object as the first\\nPostMessage() parameter, simply pass the command constant that represents the\\ntype of message to be posted. Here\\'s how a WAGER_MSG could be posted:\\ntheWindow->PostMessage(WAGER_MSG, theWindow);\\n\\nWhen a command constant is passed in place of a BMessage object, the\\nPostMessage() function takes it upon itself to do the work of creating the\\nBMessage object and initializing the new object\\'s what data member to the value\\nof the passed command constant. This method of invoking PostMessage() is\\nacceptable only when the message to be created contains no data (other than the\\ncommand constant itself). If a posted message object is to include additional data,\\nthen PostMessage() won\\'t know how to add it to the newly created message\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nMenu Items and Message Dispatching\\nThe code in this section shows that the poster of the message and the target of\\nthe message can be the same object. You\\'ve already seen this situation several\\ntimes when working with menus, though the comparison may not be immediately noticeable. When a new menu item is created and added to a menu, a\\nnew BMessage object is created and associated with the new menu item:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nWhen the user selects the Open menu item, the MENU_OPEN_MSG message is\\nsent to the message loop of the window that holds the menu item. No call to\\nPostMessage() is needed, as the system implicitly dispatches the message by\\nway of a call to DispatchMessage(). By default, the BMenuItem constructor\\nhas made this same window the handler of this message, so the message typically gets dispatched to the MessageReceived() function of the window\\n(though it could end up going to a hook function if the menu item message\\nwas a system message such as B_QUIT_REQUESTED):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\n// open a file;\\nbreak;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhile the system takes care of menu handling without your code needing to\\ninclude an explicit call to PostMessage(), the effect is the same.\\nWhile the target handler for a menu item-associated message is the window\\nthat holds the menu, you can change this default condition. A BMenuItem is\\nderived from the BInvoker class (a simple class that creates objects that can\\nbe invoked to send a message to a target), so you can call the BInvoker function SetTarget() to make the change. After the following call, an Open menu\\nitem selection will send a MENU_OPEN_MSG to the application\\'s version of\\nMessageReceived() rather than to the window\\'s version of this function:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(be_app);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nobject. Working with more complex messages--messages that hold data--is the\\nsubject of the next section.\\nMessage-posting example project\\nThe WindowMessage1 project demonstrates one way to stagger windows. Moving\\nwindows about the screen is a trivial task that doesn\\'t necessarily require the use\\nof messages. That\\'s all the better reason to choose this chore for a message-related\\nexample--it lets me concentrate on working with messages rather than on solving\\na difficult problem!\\nA new WindowMessage1 window has a File menu that consists of a single item: a\\nNew item that creates a new window. The program begins by opening a single\\nwindow near the upper-left corner of the screen. When the user chooses New\\nfrom the File menu, all open windows jump 30 pixels down and 30 pixels to the\\nright of their current locations. Thus, if a user chooses New a number of times\\n(without moving the windows as they\\'re created), the windows end up staggered\\n(as shown in Figure 9-5) rather than piled up like cards in a deck.\\n\\nFigure 9-5. The staggered windows of the WindowMessage1 program\\n\\nThe WindowMessage1 project defines two application-defined message constants.\\nA message of type MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG is implicitly generated whenever the\\nuser selects the New menu item. A message of type MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG is explicitly posted as a part of carrying out a New menu item selection:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG\\nMOVE_WINDOWS_MSG\\n\\n\\'nwwd\\'\\n\\'anwd\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor adds a menubar with the single menu to a new\\nwindow. The AddItem() function that adds the menu item is responsible for associating a BMessage of type MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG with the menu item:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"New Window\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nEach time the New menu item is selected, a copy of the menu item\\'s message is\\ncreated. A message object of this type consists of nothing more than the message\\nconstant MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG. The new message object is sent to the message\\'s handler. By default, this handler is the window the menu item appears in.\\nSo it is the MessageReceived() function of the MyHelloWindow class that\\nbecomes responsible for handling the message generated by a New menu item\\nselection:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG, be_app);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIf I wanted the New menu item to simply create a new MyHelloWindow, I could\\ndo that with just a few lines of code. But besides creating a new window, the handling of this menu item choice might affect a number of existing windows. Keeping track of the windows that are currently open is the responsibility of the\\nBApplication object, so I create a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG and pass it to the application as a means of signaling the application to offset each open window. Including the message constant MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG in the call to PostMessage() tells\\nthis routine to create a new message object and assign the message constant\\nMOVE_WINDOWS_MSG to the new message object\\'s what data member. Since my\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nmessages of type MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG won\\'t contain any additional data, this\\nmessage-creation shortcut is appropriate. The new message object is then posted\\nto the application object (per the second PostMessage() parameter).\\nThe MyHelloApplication class is to handle application-defined messages, so the\\nclass now needs to override MessageReceived(). Since the program allows multiple windows and doesn\\'t keep constant track of which window is active, the\\nMyHelloWindow data member fMyWindow that appears in similar examples has\\nbeen eliminated:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloApplication version of MessageReceived() uses the Chapter 4\\nmethod of repeatedly calling the BApplication function WindowAt() to gain a\\nreference to each currently open window. Once found, a window is moved by\\ninvoking the BWindow function MoveBy(). After all existing windows have been\\nmoved, a new window is opened near the upper-left corner of the screen.\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG:\\nBWindow *oldWindow;\\ni = 0;\\nwhile (oldWindow = WindowAt(i++)) {\\n}\\nBRect\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\ntheRect;\\n*newWindow;\\n\\nnewWindow = new MyHelloWindow(theRect);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\ninherited::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe BApplication function WindowAt() returns a BWindow object--so that\\'s\\nwhat I\\'ve declared oldWindow to be. The only action I take with the returned window is to call the BWindow function MoveBy(). If I needed to perform some\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow-specific action on the window (for instance, if the\\nMyHelloWindow class defined a member function that needed to be invoked),\\nthen I\\'d first need to typecast oldWindow to a MyHelloWindow object.\\nAdding and retrieving message data\\nA number of BMessage member functions make it possible to easily add information to any application-defined message object. The prototypes for several of these\\nroutines are listed here:\\nstatus_t AddBool(const char\\nbool\\n\\n*name,\\naBool)\\n\\nstatus_t AddInt32(const char\\n\\n*name,\\n\\nstatus_t AddFloat(const char\\nfloat\\n\\n*name,\\naFloat)\\n\\nstatus_t AddRect(const char\\nBRect\\n\\n*name,\\nrect)\\n\\nstatus_t AddString(const char\\nconst char\\n\\n*name,\\n*string)\\n\\nstatus_t AddPointer(const char\\nconst void\\n\\n*name,\\n*pointer)\\n\\nTo add data to a message, create the message object and then invoke the\\nBMessage function suitable to the type of data to add to the message object. The\\nfollowing snippet adds a pair of numbers, each stored as a 32-bit integer, to a\\nmessage:\\n#define\\nBMessage\\n\\nHI_LOW_SCORE_MSG\\n\\n\\'hilo\\'\\n\\n*currentScoreMsg = new BMessage(HI_LO_SCORE_MSG);\\nhighScore = 96;\\nlowScore = 71;\\n\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, a new message object exists--one that is referenced by the variable currentScoreMsg. This message has a what data member\\nvalue of HI_LO_SCORE_MSG, and holds integers with values of 96 and 71.\\nFor each Add function, the BMessage class defines a Find function. Each Find\\nfunction is used to extract one piece of information from a message:\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindBool(const char *name,\\nbool\\n*value) const;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindInt32(const char *name,\\n*val) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindFloat(const char *name,\\nfloat\\n*f) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindRect(const char *name,\\nBRect\\n*rect) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindString(const char *name,\\nconst char **str) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindPointer(const char *name,\\nvoid\\n**ptr) const;\\n\\nTo make use of data in a message, the originating object creates the message,\\ninvokes Add functions to add the data, and posts the message using\\nPostMessage(). The receiving object invokes Find functions to extract any or all\\nof the message\\'s data from the object that receives the message.\\nData added to a message always has both a name and a type. These traits alone\\nare usually enough to extract the data--it\\'s not your program\\'s responsibility to\\nkeep track of data ordering in a message object (the exception being arrays, which\\nare covered just ahead). To access the two integers stored in the previous snippet\\'s currentScoreMsg message object, use this code:\\n\\nhighestValue;\\nlowestValue;\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s worthwhile to note that when adding data to a message, you can use the same\\nname and datatype for more than one piece of information. For instance, two high\\nscore values could be saved in one message object as follows:\\n\\nIn such a situation, an array of the appropriate datatype (32-bit integers in this\\nexample) is set up and the values are inserted into the array in the order they are\\nadded to the message. As expected, array element indices begin at 0. There is a\\nsecond version of each Find routine, one that has an index parameter for finding\\na piece of information that is a part of an array. For instance, the FindInt32()\\nfunction used for accessing an array element looks like this:\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindInt32(const char *name,\\nindex,\\n*val) const;\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nTo access an array element, include the index argument. Here the value of 96 (the\\nsecond element, with an index of 1) is being retrieved from the\\ncurrentScoreMsg message:\\n\\nsecondHighValue;\\n\\n\\nMake sure to check out the BMessage class description in the Application Kit\\nchapter of the Be Book. There you\\'ll find descriptions for other Add and Find routines, such as AddInt16() and FindPoint(). You\\'ll also see the other variants of\\neach of the Add and Find routines I\\'ve listed. The Be Book also discusses the universal, or generic, AddData() member function. You can optionally use this routine in place of any of the type-specific functions (such as AddInt32() or\\nAddFloat()) or for adding data of an application-defined type to a message\\nobject.\\nMessage data example project\\nThe WindowMessage2 project does the same thing as the WindowMessage1\\nproject--it offsets all open windows when a new window is opened. Like\\nWindowMessage1, this latest project uses messages to carry out its task. Let\\'s look\\nat the different approach used by the two projects.\\nRecall that when the WindowMessage1 program opened a new window, the active\\nwindow created a single message and sent it to the application object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function. It was then the responsibility of the application\\nobject to locate and move each window. The application did that by looping\\nthrough the window list and calling MoveBy() for each window it encountered.\\nIn the WindowMessage2 program, the active window\\'s MessageReceived() function cycles through the window list. When a window is encountered, a reference\\nto it is stored as data in a message, and that message is posted to the application.\\nWhen the application object\\'s MessageReceived() function gets the message, it\\nretrieves the window reference and moves that one window. Thus the window\\nthat holds the selected New menu item may generate numerous messages (one for\\neach window that\\'s already open). The WindowMessage1 project may have acted\\na little more efficiently, but WindowMessage2 gives me the opportunity to post a\\nslew of messages! It also gives me an excuse to store some data in each message--something the WindowMessage1 project didn\\'t do.\\nWindowMessage2 defines the same two application-defined messages as the\\nWindowMessage1 project--a MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG issued by a selection of the\\nNew menu item, and a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG created by the window and sent to\\nthe application. This latest version of the MyHelloWindow constructor is identical\\nto the version in the WindowMessage1 project--refer back to that example to see\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nthe listing. The MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived(), however, is different. Instead of simply creating a new MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG and sending it to the\\napplication, this function now repeatedly calls the BApplication function\\nWindowAt(). For each open window, the loop creates a new message, adds a\\nwindow reference to the message, and posts the message to the application:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG:\\nBRect\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBWindow\\nBMessage\\n\\ntheRect;\\n*newWindow;\\n*oldWindow;\\ni = 0;\\n*newWindowMsg;\\n\\nwhile (oldWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nnewWindowMsg = new BMessage(MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG);\\nnewWindowMsg->AddPointer(\"Old Window\", oldWindow);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(newWindowMsg, be_app);\\n}\\nnewWindow = new MyHelloWindow(theRect);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nEach posted MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG message has the application as the designated\\nhandler. When a message reaches the application object, that object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function calls FindPointer() to access the window of\\ninterest. The BMessage function name (FindPointer()), along with the data\\nname (\"Old Window\"), indicates that the message object data should be searched\\nfor a pointer stored under the name \"Old Window.\" Of course, in this example,\\nthat one piece of information is the only data stored in a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG message, but the technique applies to messages of any size. A window object is a\\npointer, so the returned value can be used as is--a call to the BWindow function\\nMoveBy() is all that\\'s needed to relocate the window:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG:\\nBWindow *theWindow;\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nmessage->FindPointer(\"Old Window\", &theWindow);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIf you enable the debugger and run the program, you might be able\\nto see multithreading in action. If you set a breakpoint in the\\nMyHelloApplication version of MessageReceived(), you\\'ll note\\nthat, as expected, the function gets called once for each already\\nopen window. You may be surprised to see the new window open\\nbefore the last of the already opened windows is moved. With several windows open, a number of messages are posted to the application. One by one the application pulls these messages from its\\nqueue and handles each by moving one window. While that\\'s going\\non, the code that creates the new window may very well execute.\\n\\nA second message data example project\\nThe previous two projects both relied on the user making a menu selection to\\ntrigger the posting of a message to the application object--it was a menu itemgenerated message handled in a window\\'s MessageReceived() function that in\\nturn created another message. While it may in fact be a menu item selection or\\nother user action that causes your program to create still another message, this\\ndoesn\\'t have to be the case. The stimulus may be an event unrelated to any direct\\naction by the user that causes your program to create and post a message. Here, in\\nthe AlertMessage project, the launching of an application may result in that program creating a message.\\nAll Be applications can be launched by either double-clicking on the program\\'s\\nicon or by typing the program\\'s name from the command line. Like any of the\\nexamples in this book, the AlertMessage program can be launched by opening a\\nterminal window: run the Terminal application from the Tracker\\'s app menu,\\nmove to the directory that holds the AlertMessage program, and type the program\\nname. Regardless of whether AlertMessage launches from the desktop or from the\\ncommand line, a single window opens. If the program starts up from the command line, however, the option exists to choose the number of windows that will\\nautomatically open. To take advantage of this option, the user need simply follow\\nthe program name with a space and the desired number of windows. Figure 9-6\\nshows how I worked my way into the folder that holds my copy of AlertMessage,\\nand how I then indicated that the program should start with three windows open.\\nThe AlertMessage program allows at most five windows to be opened at application launch. If you launch AlertMessage from the command line and enter a value\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nFigure 9-6. Launching the AlertMessage program from the command line\\n\\ngreater than 5, the program will execute, but only five windows will open. In such\\na case, the program gives the user an indication of what happened by displaying\\nan alert like the one shown in Figure 9-7.\\n\\nFigure 9-7. The windows of the AlertMessage program\\n\\nThe alert in Figure 9-7 is displayed thanks to a message the application posts to\\nitself. When the AlertMessage program launches from the command line, a check\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nis made to see if the user-specified window value is greater than 5. If it is, an\\napplication-defined WINDOW_MAX_MSG is created:\\n#define\\n\\nWINDOW_MAX_MSG\\n\\n\\'wdmx\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\n\\nThe WindowMessage2 project demonstrated how to add a pointer to a message.\\nHere you see how to add a Boolean value and a string. The means are BMessage\\nAdd functions--data of other types is added in a similar manner:\\nbool\\nconst char\\n\\nbeepOnce = true;\\n*alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\n\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"Alert String\", alertString);\\n\\nThe beepOnce variable will be used to specify whether or not a beep should\\naccompany the display of the alert. The alertString holds the text to be displayed. Once created and set up, the message is posted to the application:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(maxWindowsMsg, be_app);\\n\\nPostMessage() specifies that the application be the message handler, so it\\'s the\\napplication object\\'s version of MessageReceived() that gets this WINDOW_MAX_\\nMSG message:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WINDOW_MAX_MSG:\\nbool\\nbeepOnce;\\nconst char *alertString;\\nBAlert\\n*alert;\\nlong\\nresult;\\nbeepOnce = message->FindBool(\"Beep\");\\nalertString = message->FindString(\"Alert String\");\\nif (beepOnce)\\nbeep();\\nalert = new BAlert(\"MaxWindowAlert\", alertString, \"OK\");\\nresult = alert->Go();\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMessageReceived() handles the message by first accessing its data. If beepOnce\\nis true, a system beep is sounded. The text of the string alertString is used as\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nthe text displayed in the alert (refer to Chapter 4 for information about alerts and\\nthe BAlert class).\\nAlertMessage is this book\\'s first example that uses a command-line argument in\\nthe launching of a program, so a little extra explanation on how a program\\nreceives and responds to such input is in order.\\nCommand-line arguments\\nAn application message (a system message that affects the application itself rather\\nthan one particular window) is both received and handled by a program\\'s\\nBApplication object. A B_ARGV_RECEIVED message is such an application message. When a program is launched with one or more arguments from the command line, a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message is delivered to the application. Unlike\\nmost application messages, a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message holds data. In particular, it holds two pieces of data. The first, argc, is an integer that specifies how\\nmany arguments the program receives. The second, argv, is an array that holds\\nthe actual arguments. Because the program name itself is considered an argument, the value of argc will be one greater than the number of arguments the\\nuser typed. The array argv will thus always have as its first element the string that\\nis the name of the program. Consider the case of the user launching the justdiscussed AlertMessage program as follows:\\n$ AlertMessage 4\\n\\nHere the value of argc will be 2. The string in argv[0] will be \"AlertMessage\"\\nprefaced with the pathname, while the string in argv[1] will be \"4\". Because all\\narguments are stored as strings, you\\'ll need to convert strings to numbers as necessary. Here I\\'m using the atoi() string-to-integer function from the standard C++\\nlibrary to convert the above user-entered argument from the string \"4\" to the integer 4:\\n\\nThe fact that the program\\'s path is included as part of the program\\nname in the string argv[0] is noteworthy if you\\'re interested in\\ndetermining the program\\'s name (remember--from the desktop the\\nuser is free to change the name of your application!). If the user is\\nkeeping the AlertMessage program in the computer\\'s root directory,\\nand launches it from the command line while in a subdirectory, the\\nvalue of argv[0] will be \"/root/AlertMessage\". If your program is to\\nderive its own name from argv[0], it should strip off leading characters up to and including the final \"/\" character.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nWhen a program receives a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message, it dispatches it to its\\nArgvReceived() function. I\\'ve yet to discuss this BApplication member function because up to this point none of my example projects have had a provision\\nfor handling user input at application launch. The AlertMessage program does\\naccept such input, so its application object needs to override this routine:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\nArgvReceived(int32 argc, char **argv);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe program relies on a number of constants in opening each window. WINDOW_\\nWIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT define the size of each window. WINDOW_1_LEFT and\\nWINDOW_1_TOP establish the screen position of the first window. The two offset\\nconstants establish how each subsequent window is to be staggered from the previously opened window:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nWINDOW_WIDTH\\nWINDOW_HEIGHT\\nWINDOW_H_OFFSET\\nWINDOW_V_OFFSET\\n\\n\\nRegardless of whether the user launches AlertMessage from the desktop or from\\nthe shell, one window is always opened. The AlertMessage version of\\nArgvReceived() looks at the value the user typed in following the program\\nname and uses that number to determine how many additional windows to open.\\nArgvReceived() thus opens the user-entered value of windows, less one. Before\\ndoing that, however, the user\\'s value is checked to verify that it doesn\\'t exceed\\n5--the maximum number of windows AlertMessage allows. If the value is greater\\nthan 5, ArgvReceived() creates a WINDOW_MAX_MSG, supplies this message with\\nsome data, and posts the message. After posting the message, the number of windows to open is set to the maximum of 5:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::ArgvReceived(int32 argc, char **argv)\\n{\\nif (userNumWindows > 5) {\\nbool\\nbeepOnce = true;\\nconst char *alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\nBMessage\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"AlertString\", alertString);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(maxWindowsMsg, be_app);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nuserNumWindows = 5;\\n}\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\naRect;\\nleft = WINDOW_1_LEFT + WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\nright = left + WINDOW_WIDTH;\\ntop = WINDOW_1_TOP + WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\nbottom = top + WINDOW_HEIGHT;\\n*theWindow;\\ni;\\n\\nfor (i = 2; i <= userNumWindows; i++) {\\naRect.Set(left, top, right, bottom);\\ntheWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nleft\\n+= WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\nright += WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\ntop\\n+= WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\nbottom += WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nAs mentioned in the description of the AlertMessage project, a posted WINDOW_\\nMAX_MSG is handled by the application object\\'s MessageReceived() function.\\nThere the message data is accessed and an alert posted.\\nAdding data of any type to a message\\nThe BMessage Add routines, such as AddBool() and AddString(), serve as a\\nsort of shorthand notation for the more generic BMessage function AddData().\\nAddData() can be used to add data of any type to a message. Thus, AddData()\\ncan be used to add data of an application-defined type, or data of any of the types\\nthat can be added using a specific Add function. Here\\'s the declaration for\\nAddData():\\nstatus_t AddData(const char\\ntype_code\\nconst void\\nssize_t\\nbool\\n\\n*name,\\ntype,\\n*data,\\nnumBytes,\\nfixedSize = true,\\nnumItems = 1)\\n\\nThe name and data parameters serve the same purposes as their counterparts in\\nthe other Add routines--name serves as an identifier that\\'s used when later accessing the data through the use of a Find function, while data holds the data itself.\\nUnlike most Add functions, though, in AddData() the data parameter is a pointer\\nto the data rather than the data itself.\\nBecause AddData() can accept data of any type, you need to specify both the\\nkind of data to add and the size, in bytes, of data that is to be added. Use the\\nappropriate Be-defined type constant for the type parameter. The third column of\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nTable 9-1 lists these constants for commonly used Add routines--make sure to turn\\nto the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of the Be Book\\nfor more Add routines and corresponding type constants.\\nTable 9-1.

Both\\nthese parameters help AddData() work with data more efficiently. If the array is\\nto hold items that are identical in size (such as an array of integers), pass true for\\nfixedSize. If you have an idea of how many items will eventually be in the\\narray, pass that value as numItems. An inaccurate value for numItems just diminishes slightly the efficiency with which AddData() utilizes memory--it won\\'t\\ncause the routine to fail.\\nThe just-described AlertMessage example project created a message object and\\nadded a bool value and a string to that message:\\nbool\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nbeepOnce = true;\\n*alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\n\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"AlertString\", alertString);\\n\\nBecause AddBool() and AddString() are simply data-type \"tuned\" versions of\\nAddData(), I could have added the data using two calls to AddData(). To do\\nthat, I\\'d replace the last two lines in the above snippet with this code:\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddData(\"Beep\", B_BOOL_TYPE, &beepOnce, sizeof(bool));\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddData(\"AlertString\", B_STRING_TYPE,\\nalertString, strlen(alertString));\\n\\nAddData() accepts a pointer to the data to add, so the bool variable beepOnce is\\nnow prefaced with the \"address of\" operator. The string alertString is already\\nin the form of a pointer (char *), so it can be passed as it was for AddString().\\nAs shown in the above snippet, if you\\'re adding a bool value, pass B_BOOL_TYPE\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nas the second AddData() parameter. You generally determine the size of the data\\nto add through the standard library function sizeof() or, as in the case of a\\nstring, the strlen() routine.\\nLike the other Add functions, AddData() has a companion Find function--\\nFindData(). Here\\'s that routine\\'s prototype:\\nstatus_t FindData(const char\\ntype_code\\nconst void\\nssize_t\\n\\n*name,\\ntype,\\n**data,\\n*numBytes)\\n\\nFindData() searches a message for data that is of the type specified by the type\\nparameter and that is stored under the name specified by the name parameter.\\nWhen it finds it, it stores a pointer to it in the data parameter, and returns the\\nnumber of bytes the data consists of in the numBytes parameter. An example of\\nthe use of FindData() appears next.\\nData, messages, and the clipboard\\nEarlier in this chapter, I discussed the clipboard, but held off on presenting an\\nexample project. Here\\'s why: the clipboard holds its data in a BMessage object,\\nand the details of accessing message data weren\\'t revealed until well past this\\nchapter\\'s first mention of the clipboard. Now that you\\'ve been introduced to the\\nclipboard and have a background in BMessage basics, working with the clipboard will seem simple.\\nThe clipboard is represented by a BClipboard object that includes a data member that is a BMessage object. Items on the clipboard are all stored as separate\\ndata in this single clipboard message object. This is generally of little importance\\nto you because most program interaction with the clipboard is transparent. For\\ninstance, when you set up a Paste menu item, the B_PASTE message is associated\\nwith the menu item, and your work to support pasting is finished. Here\\'s the pertinent code:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE), \\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nIf your program has cause to add data to, or retrieve data from, the clipboard by\\nmeans other than the standard Be-defined messages, it can. Only then is it important to understand how to interact with the clipboard\\'s data.\\nBecause the clipboard object can be accessed from any number of objects\\n(belonging to your application or to any other running application), the potential\\nfor clipboard data to be accessed by two threads at the same time exists. Clipboard access provides a specific example of locking and unlocking an object, the\\ntopic discussed in this chapter\\'s \"Messaging\" section. Before working with the clipboard, call the BClipboard function Lock() to prevent other access by other\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nthreads (if the clipboard is in use by another thread when your thread calls\\nLock(), your thread will wait until clipboard access becomes available). When finished, open up clipboard access by other threads by calling the BClipboard function Unlock():\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\n// access clipboard data here\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nThe global clipboard is typically used to hold a single item--the most recent item\\ncopied by the user. Adding a new item generally overwrites the current item\\n(which could be any manner of data, including that copied from a different application). If your thread is adding data to the clipboard, it should first clear out the\\nexisting clipboard contents. The BClipboard function Clear() does that. After\\nadding its own data, your thread needs to call the BClipboard function Commit()\\nto confirm that this indeed is the action to perform. So while the above snippet\\nworks fine for retrieving clipboard data, it should be expanded a bit for adding\\ndata to the clipboard:\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\n// add clipboard data here\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nTo actually access the clipboard\\'s data, call the BClipboard function Data(). This\\nfunction obtains a BMessage object that you use to reference the clipboard\\'s data.\\nThis next snippet shows that here you don\\'t use new to create the message--the\\nData() function returns the clipboard\\'s data-holding message:\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\nAt this point, clipboard data can be accessed using BMessage functions such as\\nAddData() and FindData(). Here the text \"Testing123\" replaces whatever currently resides on the clipboard:\\nconst char *theString = \"Testing123\";\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nclipMessage->AddData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, theString,\\nstrlen(theString));\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nThe clipboard exists for data exchange--including interapplication exchange. So\\nyou might not be surprised to see that MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) may be involved in clipboard usage. When you pass AddData() a type\\nparameter of B_MIME_TYPE, you\\'re specifying that the data to be added is of the\\nMIME main type and subtype listed in the name parameter. For adding text, use\\ntext as the main type and plain as the subtype--resulting in \"text/plain\" as the\\nfirst AddData() parameter.\\nTo retrieve data from the clipboard, use the BMessage function FindData(). This\\nsnippet brings whatever text is currently on the clipboard into a string variable\\nnamed clipString. It also returns the number of bytes of returned text in the\\nvariable numBytes:\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nBMessage\\nconst char\\nssize_t\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n*clipString;\\nnumBytes;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\nclipMessage->FindData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, &clipString, &numBytes);\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nClipboard example project\\nThe ClipboardMessage project provides a simple example of adding text to the\\nclipboard. This project adds just a few changes to the Chapter 8 project TextViewEdit. Recall that TextViewEdit displayed a window that included a single\\nmenu with a Test item that sounds the system beep, and the four standard textediting items. The window also included one BTextView object. Figure 9-8 shows\\nthat for the new ClipboardMessage project a new Add String menu item has been\\nadded. Choosing Add String clears the clipboard and places the text \"Testing123\"\\non it. Subsequent pastes (whether performed by choosing the Paste menu item or\\nby pressing Command-v) place this string at the insertion point in the window\\'s\\ntext view object.\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor associates a new application-defined message\\nconstant, ADD_STR_MSG, with the new Add String menu item. Except for the new\\nAddItem() line before the call to Show(), the MyHelloWindow constructor is\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nFigure 9-8. The window of the ClipboardMessage program\\n\\nidentical to the version used in the Chapter 8 TextViewEdit project on which this\\nnew project is based, so only a part of the constructor is shown here:\\n#define\\n\\nADD_STR_MSG\\n\\n\\'adst\\'\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Add String\",\\nnew BMessage(ADD_STR_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MessageReceived() function holds the new clipboard code. Selecting Add\\nString locks and clears the clipboard, accesses the clipboard data-holding message, adds a string to the clipboard, commits that addition, then unlocks the clipboard for use by other threads. Here\\'s MessageReceived() in its entirety (recall\\nthat the text-editing commands B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL are\\nstandard messages that are automatically handled by the system):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase ADD_STR_MSG:\\nconst char *theString = \"Testing123\";\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nclipMessage->AddData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, theString,\\nstrlen(theString));\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEST_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Files and the Storage\\nKit\\n Using Standard Open\\nand Save Panels\\n Onward\\n\\n10.\\n\\nFiles\\n\\nMany utility programs don\\'t involve file handling, but almost all real-world, fullfeatured applications do. Before your own best-selling Be application can be considered complete, it will no doubt need to have the capability to open files, save\\nfiles, or both. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how these file-handling techniques are\\nimplemented. To open a file, your program will need to find it on disk; and to\\nsave a file, your program will need to specify a location on disk. So before getting\\ninto the actual manipulation of files, this chapter introduces you to the BeOS file\\nhierarchy.\\n\\nFiles and the Storage Kit\\nUp to this point, we\\'ve managed to avoid the Storage Kit. Now that we\\'re about to\\nwork with persistent data, though, it\\'s time to dig into a number of the classes in\\nthis useful kit. The classes of the Storage Kit allow you to write programs that recognize the hierarchy of files on disk, read from and write to files, and study or\\nchange file attributes.\\nThere are a number of Storage Kit classes that aid in working with files, including,\\nunsurprisingly, the BFile class. But Be also tips its hat to Unix programmers by\\nsupporting standard POSIX file functions such as open(), close(), read(), and\\nwrite(). If you have a Unix programming background, you\\'ll feel right at home\\nusing POSIX functions to implement file-handling tasks such as saving a document\\'s data to a file. If you aren\\'t comfortable with Unix, you probably aren\\'t\\nfamiliar with POSIX. That\\'s okay, because the Storage Kit also defines classes (such\\nas BFile) that let you work with files outside the realm of POSIX. In this chapter\\nI\\'ll cover file manipulation using both techniques.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nPOSIX, or Portable Operating System Interface for Unix, is a standard\\ndeveloped so that buyers (particularly the U.S. government) could be\\nassured of purchasing programs that ran on a variety of systems and\\nconfigurations. A POSIX-compliant program is written to a strict standard so that it is easily ported. It\\'s also designed to run on any\\nPOSIX-compliant operating system, which includes most variants of\\nUnix.\\n\\nFile Organization\\nThe BeOS, like the Mac OS, Windows, and Unix, organizes files hierarchically.\\nFiles, and the directories (or folders) that hold files, are organized in a hierarchy or\\ntree. Each directory may hold files, other directories, or both. Each item (file or\\ndirectory) has a single parent directory--a directory in which the item resides. The\\nparent directory of an item may, of course, have a parent of its own. Thus the creation of a hierarchy. The common ancestor for all the files and directories in the\\nhierarchy is a directory referred to as the root directory.\\nA single file, regardless of its place in the hierarchy, is considered to have both an\\nentry and a node. In short, a file\\'s entry is its pathname, or location in the hierarchy, while the file\\'s node is the actual data that makes up the file. These two parts\\nof a file serve different purposes, and one part can be manipulated without affecting the other part. For instance, a file\\'s entry (its pathname) can be altered without changing the file\\'s node (its contents, or data).\\nEntries\\nSearching, opening, and saving a file all involve an entry. Your program needs to\\nknow, or establish, the location of a file before it can work with it. The entry_\\nref data structure is used to keep track of the entry, or entries, your program is to\\nwork with. A Be program relies on an object of the BEntry class if it needs to\\nmanipulate an entry. In this chapter, you\\'ll see examples that use both the entry_\\nref data structure and the BEntry class.\\nNodes\\nTo manipulate a file\\'s contents--something done during reading and writing a\\nfile--a program works with the file\\'s node. For this purpose, the BeOS defines a\\nnode_ref data structure and a BNode class. The BFile class is derived from\\nBNode, and it is the BFile class that I\\'ll use in this chapter\\'s examples.\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\nAn operating system with a graphical user interface typically provides standardized means for opening and saving files. That maintains consistency from program to program, and allows the user to work intuitively with files regardless of\\nthe program being used. The BeOS is no exception. In Figure 10-1, you see the\\nstandard Save file panel. The Open file panel looks similar to the Save file panel,\\nwith the primary difference being the Open file panel\\'s omission of the text view\\nused in the Save file panel to provide a name for a file.\\n\\nFigure 10-1. The standard Save file panel\\n\\nUsing BFilePanel to Create a Panel\\nThe Storage Kit defines a single BFilePanel class that\\'s used to create both a\\nSave file panel object and an Open file panel object. The BFilePanel constructor, shown below, is a bit scary-looking, but as you\\'ll soon see, most of the arguments can be ignored and left at their default values:\\nBFilePanel(file_panel_mode\\nBMessenger\\nentry_ref\\nbool\\nBMessage\\nBRefFilter\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nmode = B_OPEN_PANEL,\\n*target = NULL,\\n*start_directory = NULL,\\nnode_flavors = 0,\\nallow_multiple_selection = true,\\n*message = NULL,\\n*filter = NULL,\\nmodal = false,\\nhide_when_done = true);\\n\\nOf the numerous arguments, by far the one of most importance is the first--mode.\\nThe type of panel the BFilePanel constructor creates is established by the value\\nof mode. Once a BFilePanel object is created, there\\'s no way to change its type,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nso you need to know in advance what purpose the panel is to serve. To specify\\nthat the new BFilePanel object be a Save file panel, pass the Be-defined constant B_SAVE_PANEL:\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\nsavePanel = new BFilePanel(B_SAVE_PANEL);\\n\\nTo instead specify that the new object be an Open file panel, pass the Be-defined\\nconstant B_OPEN_PANEL. Or, simply omit the parameter completely and rely on\\nthe default value for this argument (see the above constructor definition):\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\nfOpenPanel = new BFilePanel();\\n\\nCreating a new panel doesn\\'t display it. This allows your program to create the\\npanel at any time, then display it only in response to the user\\'s request. For an\\nOpen file panel, that\\'s typically when the user chooses the Open item from the\\nFile menu. For the Save file panel, the display of the panel comes when the user\\nchooses the Save As item from the File menu. In response to the message issued\\nby the system to the appropriate MessageReceived() function, your program will\\ninvoke the BFilePanel function Show(), as done here for the fOpenPanel\\nobject:\\nfOpenPanel->Show();\\n\\nAssuming you follow normal conventions, the files shown are the contents of the\\ncurrent working directory. When a panel is displayed, control is in the hands of\\nthe user. Once the user confirms a choice (whether it\\'s a file selection in the Open\\nfile panel, a click on the Save button in the Save file panel, or a click on the Cancel button in either type of panel), a message is automatically sent by the system\\nto the panel\\'s target. By default the panel\\'s target is the application object, but this\\ncan be changed (either in the BFilePanel constructor or by invoking the panel\\nobject\\'s SetTarget() function). The message holds information about the\\nselected file or files (for an Open file panel) or about the file that\\'s to be created\\nand used to hold a document\\'s data (for a Save file panel). The details of how to\\nhandle the message generated in response to a user\\'s dismissing a panel appear in\\nthe next sections.\\n\\nThe File-Handling Base Project\\nIn Chapter 8, Text, you saw ScrollViewWindow, a program that displays a window with a text area that occupies the entire content area of the window. A simple text editor lends itself well to file opening and saving, so in this chapter I\\'ll\\nmodify ScrollViewWindow to make it capable of opening existing text files and\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nsaving the current document as a text file. Figure 10-2 shows the window the new\\nFileBase program displays.\\n\\nFigure 10-2. The window of the FileBase program\\n\\nWhile the FileBase program includes menu items for opening and saving files,\\nyou\\'ll soon see that the program isn\\'t up to handling those chores yet. Choosing\\nthe Open menu item displays the Open file panel, but selecting a file from the\\npanel\\'s list has no effect--the panel is simply dismissed. The Save As menu item\\ndisplays the Save file panel, but typing a name and clicking the Save button does\\nnothing more than dismiss the panel. FileBase serves as the basis (hence the\\nname) for a file-handling program. I\\'ll revise FileBase twice in this chapter: once to\\nadd file-saving abilities, and one more time to include file-opening powers. With\\nthe preliminaries taken care of here in FileBase, those two examples can focus\\nstrictly on the tasks of saving and opening a file.\\nThe Application class\\nFileBase is a spin-off of ScrollViewWindow. A quick look at how that Chapter 8\\nprogram has been enhanced makes it easier to follow the upcoming file saving\\nand opening changes. While looking over the old code, I\\'ll insert a few changes\\nhere and there to ready the program for the file-handling code. The changes begin\\nin the MyHelloApplication class definition. In any Be program, a Save file panel\\nis associated with a particular window--the user will choose Save As to save the\\ncontents of the frontmost window to a file on disk. An Open file panel, though, is\\ntypically associated with the application itself. In the MyHelloApplication class,\\na BFilePanel data member has been added to serve as the Open file panel\\nobject, while a MessageReceived() function has been added to support the handling of the message generated by the user choosing the Open menu item:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe main() function remains untouched--it still serves as the vehicle for creating\\nthe application object and starting the program running:\\nmain()\\n{\\nMyHelloApplication\\n\\n*myApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication = new MyHelloApplication();\\nmyApplication->Run();\\ndelete(myApplication);\\n}\\n\\nThe application constructor now includes the single line of code needed to create\\na new BFilePanel object. No mode parameter is passed, so by default the new\\nobject is an Open file panel. Recall that the BFilePanel constructor creates the\\npanel, but doesn\\'t display it.\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfOpenPanel = new BFilePanel();\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see ahead, when the user chooses Open from the File menu, the application generates a message that\\'s delivered to the application object. Thus the need\\nfor a MessageReceived() function for the application class. Here the choosing of\\nthe Open menu item does nothing more than display the previously hidden Open\\nfile panel:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage *message) {\\nswitch(message->what) {\\ncase MENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG:\\nfOpenPanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBApplication::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nThe window class\\nThe window\\'s one menu now holds an Open item and a Save As item, so two\\nmessage constants are necessary:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG\\nMENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG\\n\\n\\'opEN\\'\\n\\'svAs\\'\\n\\nThe window class functions are the same, but the data members are a bit different. The Chapter 8 incarnation of the text editing program defined a BViewderived class that filled the window and contained the window\\'s text view and\\nscroll view. Here I\\'m content to place the BTextView and BScrollView objects\\ndirectly in the window\\'s top view. Thus the MyHelloWindow class doesn\\'t include\\na MyDrawView member (there is no longer a MyDrawView class), but it does\\ninclude the fTextView and fScrollView members that were formerly a part of\\nMyDrawView. The class now also defines a BFilePanel object to serve as the\\nwindow\\'s Save file panel:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhich is the better way to include views in a window--by defining\\nan all-encompassing view to nest the other views in, or by simply\\nrelying on the window\\'s top view? It\\'s partially a matter of personal\\npreference. It\\'s also a matter of whether your program will make\\nchanges that affect the look of a window\\'s background. The FileBase program won\\'t change the overall look of its window (that is, it\\nwon\\'t do something such as change the window\\'s background\\ncolor), so simply including the views in the window\\'s top view\\nmakes sense. It also allows for a good example of an alternate\\nimplementation of the Chapter 8 way of doing things!\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor begins in typical fashion with the setup of the\\nmenu and its items:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n{\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG)));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(be_app);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Save As\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG)));\\n\\nIf you\\'re referencing the Chapter 8 program from which FileBase is\\nderived, you\\'ll see that the MyHelloWindow constructor just lost a\\nfew lines of code. The ScrollViewWindow version of the constructor\\nstarted with code to resize the window size-defining rectangle\\nframe. Since the FileBase window no longer includes a MyDrawView\\nunder the menubar, there\\'s no need to resize the frame such that it\\nfills the window, less the menubar area.\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor next establishes the size of the text view and the\\ntext rectangle nested in that view. The constructor creates the BTextView object,\\nmakes it a part of a BScrollView object, and then adds the scroll view to the\\nwindow:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\nviewFrame;\\ntextBounds;\\n\\nviewFrame = Bounds();\\nviewFrame.top = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nviewFrame.right -= B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\ntextBounds = viewFrame;\\ntextBounds.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\ntextBounds.InsetBy(TEXT_INSET, TEXT_INSET);\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, 0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nFinally, the Save file panel is created and the window displayed:\\nfSavePanel = new BFilePanel(B_SAVE_PANEL, BMessenger(this), NULL,\\nB_FILE_NODE, false);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nUnlike the creation of the Open file panel, the creation of the Save file panel\\nrequires that a few parameters be passed to the BFilePanel constructor. You\\nalready know that the first BFilePanel argument, mode, establishes the type of\\npanel to be created. The other parameters are worthy of a little explanation.\\nThe second argument, target, is used to define the target of the message the system will deliver to the application in response to the user\\'s dismissal of the panel.\\nThe default target is the application object, which works well for the Open file\\npanel. That\\'s because the Open file panel affects the application, and is referenced by an application data member. The Save file panel, on the other hand,\\naffects the window, and is referenced by a window data member. So I want the\\nmessage sent to the window object rather than the application object. Passing\\nBMessenger with the window object as the target makes that happen. There\\'s no\\nneed to preface BMessenger() with new, as the BFilePanel constructor handles\\nthe task of allocating memory for the message.\\nThe other argument that needs to be set is the fifth one--allow_multiple_\\nselection. Before passing a value for the fifth argument, I need to supply values\\nfor the third and fourth arguments. The third argument, panel_directory, specifies the directory to list in the Open file panel when that panel is first displayed.\\nPassing a value of NULL here keeps the default behavior of displaying the current\\nworking directory. The fourth argument, node_flavors, is used to specify the\\ntype of items considered to be valid user selections. The Be-defined constant\\nB_FILE_NODE is the default flavor--it specifies that a file (as opposed to, say, a\\ndirectory) is considered an acceptable user choice. The argument I\\'m really interested in is the fifth one--allow_multiple_selection. The default value for this\\nargument is true. FileBase doesn\\'t support the simultaneous opening of multiple\\nfiles, so a value of false needs to be passed here.\\nFileBase terminates when the user closes a window. As you\\'ve seen before, that\\naction results in the hook function QuitRequested() being invoked:\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nAn application-defined message is issued in response to the user choosing Save As\\nfrom the File menu. In response to that message, the program shows the alreadycreated Save file panel by invoking the BFilePanel function Show().\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG:\\nfSavePanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nSaving a File\\nConverting FileBase to a program that fully supports file saving is a straightforward process. No changes are needed in the MyHelloApplication class. The\\nMyHelloWindow class needs one new member function, a routine that implements the saving of a window\\'s data to a file in response to the user\\'s dismissing\\nthe Save file panel. The SaveAsFile example program adds that one function--the\\nSave() routine holds the code that implements the saving of a document\\'s text to\\ndisk. So the class declaration now contains a public declaration of Save():\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nstatus_t\\nprivate:\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nSave(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhen a Save file panel is dismissed, the system sends a B_SAVE_REQUESTED message to the affected application. This message is directed to the\\nMessageReceived() function of the Save file panel\\'s target. Recall that in the\\nFileBase program the second parameter passed to the BFilePanel constructor\\nspecified that the window be the target of the Save file panel. So the window\\'s\\nimplementation of MessageReceived() receives the message. Embedded in this\\nmessage is the pathname at which the file is to be saved. MessageReceived()\\npasses this information on to the application-defined routine Save():\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG:\\nfSavePanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ncase B_SAVE_REQUESTED:\\nSave(message);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nOn the following pages we\\'ll look first at saving a file using POSIX, then at saving\\na file with the Storage Kit.\\nUsing POSIX to save a file\\nTo work with files, you can use either the BFile class or a POSIX file of type\\nFILE. Here file-saving will be performed using the FILE type--see the sections\\n\"Using the Storage Kit to save a file\" and \"Opening a File,\" for examples of working with the BFile class.\\nThe Save() function begins with a number of local variable declarations. Each is\\ndescribed as it\\'s encountered in the Save() routine:\\nstatus_t MyHelloWindow::Save(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nentry_ref\\nref;\\nconst char *name;\\nBPath\\npath;\\nBEntry\\nentry;\\nstatus_t\\nerr = B_OK;\\nFILE\\n*f;\\n\\nThe message received by MessageReceived() and passed on to Save() has a\\nwhat field of B_SAVE_REQUESTED, a directory field that holds an entry_ref,\\nand a name field that holds the user-entered filename string describing a single\\nentry in a directory. The directory field\\'s entry_ref structure points to the\\ndirectory to which the user specified the file is to be saved. Invoking the\\nBMessage function FindRef() strips out this reference and saves it to the entry_\\nref variable ref:\\nif (err = message->FindRef(\"directory\", &ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nNext, the filename is retrieved from the message. The BMessage function\\nFindString() saves the message\\'s name field to the string variable name:\\nif (err = message->FindString(\"name\", &name) != B_OK) {\\nreturn err;\\n\\nThe next several steps are performed to get the directory and name into a form\\nthat can be passed to a file-opening routine. Recall that a file consists of an entry\\n(a location) and a node (data). The entry can be represented by an entry_ref or\\na BEntry object. Currently the entry is in the form of an entry_ref. Here the\\nentry is stored in a BEntry object. The BEntry function SetTo() handles that\\ntask:\\nif (err = entry.SetTo(&ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nA BPath object normalizes a pathname. That is, it reformats a pathname to clean it\\nup by, say, excluding a trailing slash (such as /boot/myDir/). The BEntry function GetPath() is used to store the BEntry information as a BPath object. Here\\nthe BPath object path is first set to the directory, then the filename is appended\\nto the directory:\\nentry.GetPath(&path);\\npath.Append(name);\\n\\nThe somewhat convoluted journey from the message\\'s entry_ref to a BEntry\\nobject to a BPath object is complete. Now the file directory and name appear\\ntogether in a form that can be used in the POSIX file opening function fopen():\\nif (!(f = fopen(path.Path(), \"w\")))\\nreturn B_ERROR;\\n\\nWith a new file opened, it\\'s safe to write the window\\'s data. The POSIX file function fwrite() can be used for that job. The data to write is the text of the window\\'s text view. That text is retrieved by calling the BTextView function Text().\\nThe number of bytes the text occupies can be obtained from the BTextView function TextLength(). After writing the data to the file, call the POSIX file function\\nfclose():\\nerr = fwrite(fTextView->Text(), 1, fTextView->TextLength(), f);\\nfclose(f);\\nreturn err;\\n}\\n\\nUsing the Storage Kit to save a file\\nUsing POSIX is straightforward, but so too is using the Storage Kit. Here I\\'ll modify the previous section\\'s version of the application-defined Save() function so\\nthat saving the file is done with a reliance on the Storage Kit rather than on\\nPOSIX:\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nstatus_t MyHelloWindow::Save(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nentry_ref\\nref;\\nconst char *name;\\nstatus_t\\nerr;\\n\\nThe ref and name variables are again declared for use in determining the directory to save the file to and the name to give that file. The err variable is again\\npresent for use in error checking. Gone are the BPath variable path, the BEntry\\nvariable entry, and the FILE variable f.\\nThe above code is unchanged from the previous version of Save(). First,\\nFindRef() is used to strip the directory in which the file should be saved from\\nthe message that was passed to Save(). Then FindString() is invoked to\\nretrieve the filename from the same message:\\nif (err =\\nreturn\\nif (err =\\nreturn\\n\\nmessage->FindRef(\"directory\", &ref) != B_OK)\\nerr;\\nmessage->FindString(\"name\", &name) != B_OK) {\\nerr;\\n\\nNow comes some new code. The location to which the file is to be saved is contained in the entry_ref variable ref. This variable is used as the argument in the\\ncreation of a BDirectory object. To ensure that the initialization of the new directory was successful, call the inherited BNode function InitCheck():\\nBDirectory dir(&ref);\\nif (err = dir.InitCheck() != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nA BFile object can be used to open an existing file or to create and open a new\\nfile. Here we need to create a new file. Passing the directory, filename, and an\\nopen mode does the trick. The open mode value is a combination of flags that\\nindicate such factors as whether the file is to have read and/or write permission\\nand whether a new file is to be created if one doesn\\'t already exist in the specified directory. After creating the new file, invoke the BFile version of\\nInitCheck() to verify that file creation was successful:\\nBFile file(&dir, name, B_READ_WRITE | B_CREATE_FILE);\\nif (err = file.InitCheck() != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nWith a new file opened, it\\'s time to write the window\\'s data. Instead of the POSIX\\nfile function fwrite(), here I use the BFile function Write(). The first argument is the text to write to the file, while the second argument specifies the number of bytes to write. Both of the BView functions Text() and TextLength()\\nwere described in the POSIX example of file saving. After the data is written\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nthere\\'s no need to explicitly close the file--a file is automatically closed when its\\nBFile object is deleted (which occurs when the Save() function exits):\\nerr = file.Write(fTextView->Text(), fTextView->TextLength());\\nreturn err;\\n}\\n\\nOpening a File\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to save a file\\'s data using Be classes to work with the file\\'s\\npath and standard POSIX functions for performing the actual data writing. Here I\\'ll\\ndispense with the POSIX and go with the BFile class. The last example, SaveAsFile, was derived from the FileBase program. I\\'ll carry on with the example by\\nnow adding to the SaveAsFile code such that the OpenSaveAsFile example\\nbecomes capable of both saving a text file (using the already developed POSIX\\nfile-saving code) and opening a text file (using the BFile class).\\nWhen an Open file panel is dismissed, the system responds by sending the application a B_REFS_RECEIVED message that specifies which file or files are to be\\nopened. Rather than appearing at the target\\'s MessageReceived() routine,\\nthough, this message is sent to the target\\'s RefsReceived() function. The Open\\nfile panel indicates that the application is the panel\\'s target, so a RefsReceived()\\nfunction needs to be added to the application class:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nRefsReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe implementation of RefsReceived() begins with the declaration of a few\\nlocal variables:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::RefsReceived(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nref_num;\\nentry_ref ref;\\nstatus_t\\nerr;\\n\\nThe rectangle aRect defines the boundaries of the window to open:\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nThe integer ref_num serves as a loop counter. While the Open file panel used in\\nthe OpenSaveAsFile example allows for only one file selection at a time, the program might be adapted later to allow for multiple file selections in the Open file\\npanel. Creating a loop that opens each file is an easy enough task, so I\\'ll prepare\\nfor a program change by implementing the loop now:\\nref_num = 0;\\ndo {\\nif (err = message->FindRef(\"refs\", ref_num, &ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn;\\nnew MyHelloWindow(aRect, &ref);\\nref_num++;\\n} while (1);\\n}\\n\\nThe message received by RefsReceived() has a what field of B_REFS_RECEIVED\\nand a refs field that holds an entry_ref for each selected file. Invoking the\\nBMessage function FindRef() strips out one reference and saves it to the entry_\\nref variable ref. The ref_num parameter serves as an index to the refs array of\\nentry_refs. After the last entry is obtained (which will be after the first and only\\nentry in this example), an error occurs, breaking the otherwise infinite do-while\\nloop.\\nWith an entry obtained, a new window is created. Note that the MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor now receives two parameters: the boundary-defining rectangle the\\nconstructor always has, and a new entry_ref parameter that specifies the location of the file to open. Rather than change the existing constructor, the\\nMyHelloWindow class now defines two constructors: the original and the new\\ntwo-argument version:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\n\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nstatus_t\\nprivate:\\nvoid\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame, entry_ref *ref);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nSave(BMessage *message);\\n\\nInitializeWindow(void);\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhen the program is to create a new, empty window, the original\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is called. When the program needs to instead create a\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nnew window that is to hold the contents of an existing file, the new\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is invoked.\\nThe two MyHelloWindow constructors will create similar windows: each will be\\nthe same size, have the same menubar, and so forth. So the two constructors share\\nquite a bit of common code. To avoid writing redundant code, the\\nMyHelloWindow class now defines a new routine that holds this common code.\\nEach constructor invokes this new InitializeWindow() routine. The fileopening version of the MyHelloWindow constructor then goes on to implement\\nfile handling.\\nNote in the above-listed MyHelloWindow class that the InitializeWindow()\\nroutine is declared private. It will be invoked only by other MyHelloWindow\\nmember functions, so there\\'s no need to allow outside access to it. Because all of\\nthe code from the original version of the MyHelloWindow constructor, with the\\nexception of the last line (the call to Show()), was moved wholesale to the\\nInitializeWindow() routine, there\\'s no need to show the entire listing for this\\nnew function. Instead, a summary is offered below. To see the actual code, refer\\nback to the walk-through of the MyHelloWindow constructor in this chapter\\'s \"The\\nFile-Handling Base Project\" section.\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::InitializeWindow( void )\\n{\\n// menu code\\n// text view code\\n// Save file panel code\\n}\\n\\nAlmost all of the code found in the original version of the MyHelloWindow constructor has been moved to InitializeWindow(), so the original, one-argument\\nversion of the constructor shrinks to this:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nInitializeWindow();\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe new two-argument version of the constructor begins similarly:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame, entry_ref *ref)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nInitializeWindow();\\n\\x0cOnward\\n\\n\\nWith the window set up, it\\'s on to the file-opening code. In the file-saving example, standard POSIX functions were used. Here a BFile object and BFile functions are instead used--beginning with the declaration of a BFile object:\\nBFile\\n\\nfile;\\n\\nThe second parameter passed to this MyHelloWindow constructor is the entry_\\nref for the file to open. That ref variable is used in a call to the BFile function\\nSetTo() to assign the BFile object a file to open. With the successful assignment of a file to open, it\\'s on to the actual file-opening. That begins with the declaration of a couple of variables:\\nif (file.SetTo(ref, B_READ_ONLY) == B_OK)\\n{\\noff_t\\nlength;\\nchar\\n*text;\\n\\nThe size of the file to open is determined, and returned, by the BFile function\\nGetSize():\\nfile.GetSize(&length);\\n\\nSufficient memory is allocated for the file\\'s contents by a call to malloc():\\ntext = (char *) malloc(length);\\n\\nNow it\\'s time to read the file\\'s data. The BFile function Read() handles that\\nchore. The data is text, so it\\'s saved to the character pointer text. Invoking the\\nBTextView function SetText() sets the text of the window\\'s text view to the\\nread-in text, while a call to free() releases from memory the no-longer-needed\\nfile data. With the window set up and the text view holding the data to display,\\nthere\\'s nothing left to do but display the window with a call to Show():\\nif (text && (file.Read(text, length) >= B_OK))\\nfTextView->SetText(text, length);\\nfree(text);\\n}\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nOnward\\nThis chapter\\'s OpenSaveAsFile example is the most complete program in this\\nbook--it actually does something quite useful! Using the techniques presented in\\nthe preceding chapters, you should be able to turn OpenSaveAsFile into a realworld application. Begin by polishing up the File menu. Add a New item--that\\nrequires just a few lines of code. Also add a Quit item to provide a more graceful\\nmeans of exiting the program. Chapter 8 covered text editing in detail--use that\\nchapter\\'s techniques to add a complete, functioning Edit menu. Those changes will\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nresult in a useful, functional text editor. If you want to develop a program that\\'s\\nmore graphics-oriented, go ahead--Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, and\\nChapter 5, Drawing, hold the information to get you started. If you take that route,\\nthen you can always include the text-editing capabilities covered here and in\\nChapter 8 as a part of your program. For example, a graphics-oriented application\\ncould include a built-in text editor that allows the user to enter and save notes.\\nRegardless of the type of application you choose to develop, check out Be\\'s web\\nsite at http://www.be.com/.

By the late 1990s, data telecommunications had\\nbeen opened by the expansion of the Internet. Prices plummeted. New and innovative\\ntechnologies, services, and companies emerged. Meanwhile, the work of free software\\npioneers like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and countless others was culminating\\nin the creation of a truly open software platform called Linux (or GNU/Linux). However, voice communications, ubiquitous as they were, remained proprietary. Why?\\nPerhaps it was because voice on the old public telephone network lacked the glamor\\nand promise of the shiny new World Wide Web. Or, perhaps it was because a telephone\\njust wasn\\'t as effective at supplying adult entertainment. Whatever the reason, one\\nthing was clear. Open source voice communications was about as widespread as open\\nsource copy protection software.\\nNecessity (and in some cases simply being cheap) is truly the mother of invention. In\\n1999, having started Linux Support Services to offer free and commercial technical\\nsupport for Linux, I found myself in need (or at least in perceived need) of a phone\\nsystem to assist me in providing 24-hour technical support. The idea was that people\\nwould be able to call in, enter their customer identity, and leave a message. The system\\nwould in turn page a technician to respond to the customer\\'s request in short order.\\nSince I had started the company with about $4,000 of capital, I was in no position to\\nbe able to afford a phone system of the sort that I needed to implement this scenario.\\nHaving already been a Linux user since 1994, and having already gotten my feet wet in\\nopen source software development by starting l2tpd, Gaim, and cheops, and in the\\ncomplete absence of anyone having explained the complexity of such a task, I decided\\nthat I would simply make my own phone system using hardware borrowed from\\nxi\\n\\x0cAdtran, where I had worked as a co-op student. Once I got a call into a PC, I fantasized,\\nI could do anything with it. In fact, it is from this conjecture that the official Asterisk\\nmotto (which any sizable, effective project must have) is derived:\\nIt\\'s only software!\\n\\nFor better or worse, I rarely think small. Right from the start, it was my intent that\\nAsterisk would do everything related to telephony. The name \"Asterisk\" was chosen\\nbecause it was both a key on a standard telephone and also the wildcard symbol in\\nLinux (e.g., rm -rf *).\\nSo, in 1999, I had a free telephony platform I\\'d put out on the Web and I went about\\nmy business trying to eke out a living at providing Linux technical support. However,\\nby 2001, as the economy was tanking, it became apparent that Linux Support Services\\nmight do better by pursuing Asterisk than general-purpose Linux technical support.\\nThat year, we would make contact with Jim \"Dude\" Dixon of the Zapata Telephony\\nproject. Dude\\'s exciting work was a fantastic companion to Asterisk and provided a\\nbusiness model for us to start pursuing Asterisk with more focus. After creating our\\nfirst PCI telephony interface card in conjunction with Dude, it became clear that \"Linux\\nSupport Services\" was not the best name for a telephony company, and so we changed\\nthe name to \"Digium,\" which is a whole other story that cannot be effectively conveyed\\nin writing. Enter the expansion of Voice over IP (VoIP) with its disruptive transition of\\nvoice from the old, circuit-switched networks to new IP-based networks, and things\\nreally started to take hold.\\nNow, as we\\'ve already covered, clearly most people don\\'t get very excited about telephones. Certainly, few people could share my excitement the moment I heard a dial\\ntone coming from a phone connected to my PC. However, those who do get excited\\nabout telephones get really excited about telephones. And facilitated by the Internet,\\nthis small group of people were now able to unite and apply our bizarre passions to a\\ncommon, practical project for the betterment of many.\\nTo say that telecom was ripe for an open source solution would be an immeasurable\\nunderstatement. Telecom is an enormous market due to the ubiquity of telephones in\\nwork and personal life. The direct market for telecom products has a highly technical\\naudience that is willing and able to contribute. People demand their telecom solutions\\nbe infinitely customizable. Proprietary telecom is very expensive. Creating Asterisk was\\nsimply the spark in this fuel-rich backdrop.\\nAsterisk sits at the apex of a variety of transitions (proprietary  open source; circuit\\nswitched  VoIP; voice only  voice, video, and data; digital signal processing  host\\nmedia processing; centralized directory  peer to peer) while easing those transitions\\nby providing bridges back to the older ways of doing things. Asterisk can talk to anything from a 1960s-era pulse-dial phone to the latest wireless VoIP devices, and provide\\nfeatures from simple tandem switching all the way to Bluetooth presence and DUNDi.\\nMost important of all, though, Asterisk demonstrates how a community of motivated\\npeople and companies can work together to create a project with a scope so significant\\nxii | Foreword\\n\\x0cthat no one person or company could have possibly created it on its own. In making\\nAsterisk possible, I particularly would like to thank Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman,\\nthe entire Asterisk community, and whoever invented Red Bull.\\nSo where is Asterisk going from here? Think about the history of the PC. When it was\\nfirst introduced in 1980, it had fairly limited capabilities. Maybe you could do a spreadsheet, maybe do some word processing, but in the end, not much. Over time, however,\\nits open architecture led to price reductions and new products allowing it to slowly\\nexpand its applications, eventually displacing the mini computer, then the mainframe.\\nNow, even Cray supercomputers are built using Linux-based x86 architectures. I anticipate that Asterisk\\'s future will look very similar. Today, there is a large subset of\\ntelephony that is served by Asterisk. Tomorrow, who knows what the limit might be?\\nSo, what are you waiting for? Read, learn, and participate in the future of open telecommunications by joining the Asterisk revolution!\\n--Mark Spencer\\n\\nForeword | xiii\\n\\x0c\\x0cPreface\\n\\nThis is a book for anyone who is new to AsteriskTM.\\nAsterisk is an open source, converged telephony platform, which is designed primarily\\nto run on Linux. Asterisk combines more than 100 years of telephony knowledge into\\na robust suite of tightly integrated telecommunications applications. The power of Asterisk lies in its customizable nature, complemented by unmatched standards compliance. No other PBX can be deployed in so many creative ways.\\nApplications such as voicemail, hosted conferencing, call queuing and agents, music\\non hold, and call parking are all standard features built right into the software. Moreover, Asterisk can integrate with other business technologies in ways that closed,\\nproprietary PBXes can scarcely dream of.\\nAsterisk can appear quite daunting and complex to a new user, which is why documentation is so important to its growth. Documentation lowers the barrier to entry and\\nhelps people contemplate the possibilities.\\nProduced with the generous support of O\\'Reilly Media, Asterisk:\\nThe Future of Telephony was inspired by the work started by the Asterisk Documentation Project. We have come a long way, and this book is the realization of a desire to\\ndeliver documentation that introduces the most fundamental elements of Asterisk--\\nthe things someone new to Asterisk needs to know. It is the first volume in what we\\nare certain will become a huge library of knowledge relating to Asterisk.\\nThis book was written for, and by, the Asterisk community.\\n\\nAudience\\nThis book is for those new to Asterisk, but we assume that you\\'re familiar with basic\\nLinux administration, networking, and other IT disciplines. If not, we encourage you\\nto explore the vast and wonderful library of books that O\\'Reilly publishes on these\\nsubjects. We also assume you\\'re fairly new to telecommunications, both traditional\\nswitched telephony and the new world of Voice over IP.\\n\\nxv\\n\\x0cOrganization\\nThe book is organized into these chapters:\\nChapter 1, A Telephony Revolution\\nThis is where we chop up the kindling and light the fire. Asterisk is going to change\\nthe world of telecom, and this is where we discuss our reasons for that belief.\\nChapter 2, Preparing a System for Asterisk\\nCovers some of the engineering considerations you should have in mind when\\ndesigning a telecommunications system. Much of this material can be skipped if\\nyou want to get right to installing, but these are important concepts to understand,\\nshould you ever plan on putting an Asterisk system into production.\\nChapter 3, Installing Asterisk\\nCovers the obtaining, compiling, and installation of Asterisk.\\nChapter 4, Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\nDescribes the initial configuration of Asterisk. Here we will cover the important\\nconfiguration files that must exist to define the channels and features available to\\nyour system.\\nChapter 5, Dialplan Basics\\nIntroduces the heart of Asterisk, the dialplan.\\nChapter 6, More Dialplan Concepts\\nGoes over some more advanced dialplan concepts.\\nChapter 7, Understanding Telephony\\nTaking a break from Asterisk, this chapter discusses some of the more important\\ntechnologies in use in the Public Telephone Network.\\nChapter 8, Protocols for VoIP\\nFollowing the discussion of legacy telephony, this chapter discusses Voice over\\nInternet Protocol.\\nChapter 9, The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\nIntroduces one of the more amazing components, the Asterisk Gateway Interface.\\nUsing Perl, PHP, and Python, we demonstrate how external programs can be used\\nto add nearly limitless functionality to your PBX.\\nChapter 10, Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\nDescribes how external applications can connect to Asterisk to manipulate or\\nmonitor various aspects of the system. Also included in this chapter is a gentle\\nintroduction to the Adhearsion framework.\\nChapter 11, The Asterisk GUI Framework\\nThe Asterisk GUI Framework, new in Asterisk 1.4, is a framework system that\\nallows web developers to create graphical interfaces with minimal interference to\\nthe standard configuration files.\\n\\nxvi | Preface\\n\\x0cChapter 12, Relational Database Integration\\nWalks you through setting up Asterisk to work with ODBC databases.\\nChapter 13, Managing Your Asterisk System\\nDiscusses issues regarding how to best manage your Asterisk phone system, including CDR, logs, and prompts.\\nChapter 14, Potpourri\\nBriefly covers what is, in fact, a rich and varied cornucopia of incredible features\\nand functions--all part of the Asterisk phenomenon.\\nChapter 15, Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\nPredicts a future where open source telephony completely transforms an industry\\ndesperately in need of a revolution.\\nAppendix A, VoIP Channels\\nAppendix B, Application Reference\\nAppendix C, AGI Reference\\nAppendix D, Configuration Files\\nAppendix E, Asterisk Dialplan Functions\\nAppendix F, Asterisk Manager Interface Actions\\nAppendix G, An Example of func_odbc\\n\\nSoftware\\nThis book is focused on documenting Asterisk Version 1.4; however, many of the conventions and information in this book are version-agnostic. Linux is the operating\\nsystem we have run and tested Asterisk on, with a leaning toward Red Hat syntax. We\\ndecided that while Red Hatbased distributions may not be the preferred choice of\\neveryone, their layout and utilities are nevertheless familiar to many experienced Linux\\nadministrators.\\n\\nConventions Used in This Book\\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this book:\\nItalic\\nIndicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, file extensions, pathnames,\\ndirectories, and Unix utilities.\\nConstant width\\n\\nIndicates commands, options, parameters, and arguments that must be substituted\\ninto commands.\\n\\nPreface | xvii\\n\\x0cConstant width bold\\n\\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user. Also used\\nfor emphasis in code.\\nConstant width italic\\n\\nShows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values.\\n[ Keywords and other stuff ]\\n\\nIndicates optional keywords and arguments.\\n{ choice-1 | choice-2 }\\n\\nSignifies either choice-1 or choice-2.\\nThis icon signifies a tip, suggestion, or general note.\\n\\nThis icon indicates a warning or caution.\\n\\nUsing Code Examples\\nThis book is here to help you get your job done.

With no challenges to properly exercise the skills I had developed, I spent my time trying to figure\\nout what the rest of my career was going to look like. The telecommunications industry\\nhad fallen from the pedestal of being a darling of investors to being a joke known to\\neven the most uninformed. I was supposed to feel fortunate to be one of the few who\\nstill had work, but what thankless, purposeless work it was. We knew why our industry\\nhad collapsed: the products we sold could not hope to deliver the solutions our customers required--even though the industry promised that they could. They lacked\\nflexibility, and were priced totally out of step with the functionality they were delivering\\n(or, more to the point, were failing to deliver). Nowhere in the industry were there any\\nsigns this was going to change any time soon.\\nI had been dreaming of an open source PBX for many long years, but I really didn\\'t\\nknow how such a thing could ever come to be--I\\'d given up on the idea several years\\nbefore. I knew that to be successful, an open source PBX would need to effectively\\nbridge the worlds of legacy and network-based telecom. I always failed to find anything\\nthat seemed ready.\\nThen, one fine day in spring, I half-heartedly seeded a Google search with the phrase\\n\"open source telephony,\" and discovered a bright new future for telecom: Asterisk, the\\nopen source Linux PBX.\\nThere it was: the very thing I\\'d been dreaming of for so many years. I had no idea how\\nI was going to contribute, but I knew this: open source telephony was going to cause\\na necessary and beneficial revolution in the telecom industry, and one way or another,\\nI was going to be a part of it.\\nFor me, more of a systems integrator than developer, I needed a way to contribute to\\nthe community. There didn\\'t seem to be a shortage of developers, but there sure was\\na shortage of documentation. This sounded like something I could do. I knew how to\\nwrite, I knew PBXes, and I desperately needed to talk about this phenomenon that\\nsuddenly made telecom fun again.\\nIf I contribute only one thing to this book, I hope you will catch some of my enthusiasm\\nfor the subject of open source telephony. This is an incredible gift we have been given,\\nbut also an incredible responsibility. What a wonderful challenge. What a cosmic opportunity. What delicious fun!\\n\\n To get a sense of how big the Asterisk phenomenon is, type \"PBX\" into Google. As you look at the results,\\n\\nbear in mind that the traditional PBX industry represents billions of dollars. The big players are companies\\nsuch as Avaya, Nortel, Siemens, Mitel, Cisco, NEC, and many, many more. It is somewhat telling that they\\ndon\\'t seem to be concerned about how they rank in a Google search. As a cultural barometer, we\\'re pretty\\nsure this matters.\\n\\nPreface | xxi\\n\\x0cFirst of all, I need to thank Leif and Jared for inviting me to join the Asterisk Documentation Project. I have immensely enjoyed working with both of you, and I am\\nconstantly amazed at how well our personalities and skills complement each other. A\\ntruly balanced team, are we. Also, thanks goes to Figment for all the typing.\\nTo my wife Killi, and my children Kaara, Joonas, and Joosep (who always remember\\nto visit me when I disappear into my underground lair for too long): you are a source\\nof inspiration to me. Your love is the fuel that feeds my fire, and I thank you.\\nObviously, I need to thank my parents, Jack and Martiny, for always believing in me,\\nno matter how many rules I broke. In a few years, I\\'ll have my own teenagers, and it\\'ll\\nbe your turn to laugh!\\nTo Mark Spencer: thanks for all of the things that everybody else thanks you for, but\\nalso, personally, thanks for giving generously of your time to the Asterisk community.\\nThe Toronto Asterisk Users\\' Group (http://www.taug.ca) made a quantum leap forward\\nas a result of your taking the time to speak to us, and that event will forever form a part\\nof our history. Oh yeah, and thanks for the beers, too. :-)\\nFinally, thanks to the Asterisk Community. This book is our gift to you. We hope you\\nenjoy reading it as much as we\\'ve enjoyed writing it.\\n\\nLeif Madsen\\nThe road to this book is a long one--nearly three years in the making. Back when I\\nstarted using Asterisk, possibly much like you, I didn\\'t know anything about Asterisk,\\nvery little about traditional telephony, and even less about Voice over IP. I delved right\\ninto this new and very exciting world and took in all I could. For two months during a\\nco-op term, for which I couldn\\'t immediately find work, I absorbed as much as I could,\\nasking questions, trying things and seeing what the system could do. Unfortunately\\nvery little to no documentation existed for Asterisk, aside from some dialplan examples\\nI was able to find by John Todd, and having questions answered by Brian K. West on\\nIRC. Of course, this method wasn\\'t going to scale.\\nNot being much of a coder, I wanted to contribute something back to the community,\\nand what do coders hate doing more than anything? Documentation! So I started The\\nAsterisk Documentation Assignment (TADA), a basic outline with some information\\nfor the beginnings of a book.\\nShortly after releasing it on my web site, an intelligent fellow by the name of Jared Smith\\nintroduced himself. He had similar aspirations for creating a \"dead-tree\" format book\\nfor the community, and we humbly started the Asterisk Documentation Project. Jared\\nset up a simple web site at http://www.asteriskdocs.org, a CVS server, and the very first\\nDocBook-formatted version of a book for Asterisk. From there we started filling in\\ninformation, and soon had information submitted by a number of members of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nxxii | Preface\\n\\x0cIn June of 2004, an animated chap by the name of Jim Van Meggelen started showing\\nup on the mailing lists, and contributing lots of information and documentation--this\\nwas definitely a guy we wanted on our team! Jim had the vision and the drive to really\\nget Jared\\'s and my butts in gear and to work on something grander. Jim brought us\\nyears of experience and a writing flair that we could have hardly imagined.\\nWith the core documentation team established, we embarked on a plan for the creation\\nof volumes of Asterisk knowledge, eventually to lead to a complete library and a wealth\\nof information. This book is essentially the beginning of that dream.\\nFirstly and mostly, I have to thank my parents, Rick and Carol, for always supporting\\nmy efforts, allowing me to realize my dreams, and always putting my needs ahead of\\ntheirs. Without their vision, understanding, and insight into the future, it would have\\nbeen impossible to have accomplished what I have. I love you both very much!\\nI\\'d like to thank Felix Carapaica and Bill Farkas of the Sheridan Institute of Technology\\nfor their dedication to the advancement of knowledge. Their teaching has complemented my prior learning, and has allowed me to expand my understanding of routing and\\ntelecommunications exponentially.\\nThere are far too many people to thank individually, but of particular importance, the\\nfollowing people were, and are, the most influential to my understanding of Asterisk:\\nJoshua Colp, Tilghman Lesher, Russell Bryant, Steve Murphy, Olle Johansson, Steven\\nSokol, Brian K. West, John Todd, and William Suffill, for my very first VoIP phone\\n(which I use to this day!). And for those who I said I\\'d mention in the book...thanks!\\nAnd of course, I must thank Jared Smith and Jim Van Meggelen for having the vision\\nand understanding of how important documentation really is--all of this would have\\nbeen impossible without you.\\n\\nJared Smith\\nI first started working with Asterisk in the spring of 2002. I had recently started a new\\njob with a market research company, and ended up taking a long road trip to a remote\\ncall center with the CIO. On the long drive home we talked about innovation in telephony, and he mentioned a little open source telephony project he had heard of called\\nAsterisk. Over the next few months, I was able to talk the company into buying a\\ndeveloper\\'s kit from Digium and started playing with Asterisk on company time.\\nDuring the next few months, I became more and more involved with the Asterisk community. I read the mailing lists. I scoured the archives. I hung out in the IRC channel,\\njust hoping to find nuggets of Asterisk knowledge. As time went on, I was finally able\\nto figure out enough to get Asterisk up and running.\\nThat\\'s when the real fun began.\\nWith the help of the CIO and the approval of the CEO, we moved forward with plans\\nto move our entire telecom infrastructure to Asterisk, including our corporate office\\n\\nPreface | xxiii\\n\\x0cand all of our remote call centers. Along the way, we ran into a lot of uncharted territory,\\nand I began thinking about creating a good repository of Asterisk knowledge. Over the\\ncourse of the project, we were able to do some really innovative things, such as invent\\nIAX trunking!\\nWhen all was said and done, we ended up with around forty Asterisk servers spread\\nacross many different geographical locations, all communicating with each other to\\nprovide a cohesive enterprise-class VoIP phone system. This system currently handles\\napproximately 1 million minutes of calls per month, serves several hundred employees,\\nconnects to 27 voice T1s, and saves the company around $20,000 (USD) per month\\non their telecom costs. In short, our Asterisk project was a resounding success!\\nWhile in the middle of implementing this project, I met Leif in one of the Asterisk IRC\\nchannels. We talked about ways we could help out new Asterisk users and lower the\\nbarrier to entry, and we decided to push ahead with plans to more fully document\\nAsterisk. I really wanted some good documentation in \"dead-tree\" format --basically\\na book that a new user could pick up and learn the basics of Asterisk. About that same\\ntime, the number of new users on the Asterisk mailing lists and in the IRC channels\\ngrew tremendously, and we felt that writing an Asterisk book would greatly improve\\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. The Asterisk Documentation Project was born! The rest, they\\nsay, is history.\\nSince then, we\\'ve been writing Asterisk documentation. I never thought it would be\\nthis arduous, yet rewarding. (I joked with Leif and Jim that it might be easier and less\\ncontroversial to write an in-depth tome called Religion, Gun Control, and Sushi than\\ncover everything that Asterisk has to offer in sufficient detail!) What you see here is a\\ndirect result of a lot of late nights and long weekends spent helping the Asterisk community--after all, it\\'s the least we could do, considering what Asterisk has given to us.\\nWe hope it will inspire other members of the Asterisk community to help document\\nchanges and new features for the benefit of all involved.\\nNow to thank some people:\\nFirst of all, I\\'d like to thank my beautiful wife. She\\'s put up with a lot of lonely nights\\nwhile I\\'ve been slaving away at the keyboard, and I\\'d like her to know how much I\\nappreciate her and her endless support. I\\'d also like to thank my kids for doing their\\nbest to remind me of the important things in life. I love you!\\nTo my parents: thanks for everything you\\'ve done to help me stretch and grow and\\nlearn over the years. You\\'re the best parents a person could ask for.\\nTo Dave Carr and Michael Lundberg: thanks for letting me learn Asterisk on company\\ntime. Working with both of you was truly a pleasure. May God smile upon you and\\ngrant you success and joy in all you do.\\nTo Leif and Jim: thanks for putting up with my stupid jokes, my insistence that we do\\nthings \"the right way,\" and my crazy schedule. Thanks for pushing me along, and\\n\\nxxiv | Preface\\n\\x0cmaking me a better writer. I\\'ve really enjoyed working with you two, and hope to\\ncollaborate with you on future projects!\\nTo Mark Spencer: thank you for your continued support and dedication and friendship.\\nYou\\'ve been an invaluable resource to our effort, and I truly believe that you\\'ve started\\na revolution in the world of telephony. You\\'re always welcome in my home and at my\\ndinner table!\\nTo the other great people at Digium: thank you for your help and support. We\\'re\\nespecially thankful for your willingness to give us more insight into the Asterisk code,\\nand for donating hardware so that we can better document the Asterisk Developer\\'s Kit.\\nTo Steven Sokol, Steven Critchfield, Olle E. Johansson, and all the others who have\\ncontributed to the Asterisk Documentation Project and to this book: thank you! We\\ncouldn\\'t have done it without your help and suggestions.\\n\\nPreface | xxv\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nA Telephony Revolution\\n\\nIt does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an\\nirate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires\\nin people\\'s minds.\\n--Samuel Adams\\n\\nAn incredible revolution is under way. It has been a long time in coming, but now that\\nit has started, there will be no stopping it. It is taking place in an area of technology\\nthat has lapsed embarrassingly far behind every other industry that calls itself hightech. The industry is telecommunications, and the revolution is being fueled by an open\\nsource Private Branch eXchange (PBX) called AsteriskTM.\\nTelecommunications is arguably the last major electronics industry that has remained\\nuntouched by the open source revolution.* Major telecommunications manufacturers\\nstill build ridiculously expensive, incompatible systems, running complicated, ancient\\ncode on impressively engineered yet obsolete hardware.\\nAs an example, Nortel\\'s Business Communications Manager kludges together a 15\\nyear-old Key Telephone Switch and a 1.2 GHz Celeron PC. All this can be yours for\\nbetween $5,000 and $15,000, not including telephones. If you want it to actually do\\nanything interesting, you\\'ll have to pay extra licensing fees for closed, limitedfunctionality, shrink-wrapped applications. Customization? Forget it--it\\'s not in the\\nplan. Future technology and standards compliance? Give them a year or two--they\\'re\\nworking on it.\\nAll of the major telecommunications manufacturers offer similar-minded products.\\nThey don\\'t want you to have flexibility or choice; they want you to be locked in to their\\nproduct cycles.\\n* Until now.\\n To its credit, Nortel finally got rid of Windows NT 4.0 and installed Linux. Technically a good idea, but\\n\\nrather odd, given that Nortel and Microsoft recently announced a partnership to develop enterprise telecom\\napplications together.\\n\\n\\x0cAsterisk changes all of that. With Asterisk, no one is telling you how your phone system\\nshould work, or what technology you are limited to. If you want it, you can have it.\\nAsterisk lovingly embraces the concept of standards compliance, while also enjoying\\nthe freedom to develop its own innovations. What you choose to implement is up to\\nyou--Asterisk imposes no limits.\\nNaturally, this incredible flexibility comes with a price: Asterisk is not a simple system\\nto configure. This is not because it\\'s illogical, confusing, or cryptic; to the contrary, it\\nis very sensible and practical. People\\'s eyes light up when they first see an Asterisk\\ndialplan and begin to contemplate the possibilities. But when there are literally thousands of ways to achieve a result, the process naturally requires extra effort. Perhaps it\\ncan be compared to building a house: the components are relatively easy to understand,\\nbut a person contemplating such a task must either a) enlist competent help or b)\\ndevelop the required skills through instruction, practice, and a good book on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nVoIP: Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Network\\nTelephony\\nWhile Voice over IP (VoIP) is often thought of as little more than a method of obtaining\\nfree long-distance calling, the real value (and--let\\'s be honest--challenge as well) of\\nVoIP is that it allows voice to become nothing more than another application in the\\ndata network.\\nIt sometimes seems that we\\'ve forgotten that the purpose of the telephone is to allow\\npeople to communicate. It is a simple goal, really, and it should be possible for us to\\nmake it happen in far more flexible and creative ways than are currently available to\\nus. Since the industry has demonstrated an unwillingness to pursue this goal, a large\\ncommunity of passionate people have taken on the task.\\nThe challenge comes from the fact that an industry that has changed very little in the\\nlast century shows little interest in starting now.\\n\\nThe Zapata Telephony Project\\nThe Zapata Telephony Project was conceived of by Jim Dixon, a telecommunications\\nconsulting engineer who was inspired by the incredible advances in CPU speeds that\\nthe computer industry has now come to take for granted. Dixon\\'s belief was that far\\nmore economical telephony systems could be created if a card existed that had nothing\\nmore on it than the basic electronic components required to interface with a telephone\\ncircuit. Rather than having expensive components on the card, Digital Signal Processing\\n(DSP) would be handled in the CPU by software. While this would impose a tremendous load on the CPU, Dixon was certain that the low cost of CPUs relative to their\\nperformance made them far more attractive than expensive DSPs, and, more impor-\\n\\n2 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0ctantly, that this price/performance ratio would continue to improve as CPUs continued\\nto increase in power.\\nLike so many visionaries, Dixon believed that many others would see this opportunity,\\nand that he merely had to wait for someone else to create what to him was an obvious\\nimprovement. After a few years, he noticed that not only had no one created these cards,\\nbut it seemed unlikely that anyone was ever going to. At that point it was clear that if\\nhe wanted a revolution, he was going to have to start it himself. And so the Zapata\\nTelephony Project was born:\\nSince this concept was so revolutionary, and was certain to make a lot of waves in the\\nindustry, I decided on the Mexican revolutionary motif, and named the technology and\\norganization after the famous Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. I decided to call\\nthe card the \"tormenta\" which, in Spanish, means \"storm,\" but contextually is usually\\nused to imply a big storm, like a hurricane or such.\\n\\nPerhaps we should be calling ourselves Asteristas. Regardless, we owe Jim Dixon a debt\\nof thanks, partly for thinking this up and partly for seeing it through, but mostly for\\ngiving the results of his efforts to the open source community. As a result of Jim\\'s\\ncontribution, Asterisk\\'s Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) engine came to\\nbe.\\n\\nMassive Change Requires Flexible Technology\\nThe most successful key telephone system in the world has a design limitation that has\\nsurvived 15 years of users begging for what appears to be a simple change: when you\\ndetermine the number of times your phone will ring before it forwards to voicemail,\\nyou can choose from 2, 3, 4, 6, or 10 ring cycles. Have you any idea how many times\\npeople ask for five rings? Plead as the customers might, the manufacturers of this system\\ncannot get their head around the idea that this is a problem. That\\'s the way it works,\\nthey say, and users need to get over it.\\nAnother example from the same system is that the name you program on your set can\\nonly be seven characters in length. Back in the late 1980s, when this particular system\\nwas designed, RAM was very expensive, and storing those seven characters for dozens\\nof sets represented a huge hardware expense. So what\\'s the excuse today? None. Are\\nthere any plans to change it? Hardly--the issue is not even officially acknowledged as\\na problem.\\n\\n The term DSP also means Digital Signal Processor, which is a device (usually a chip) that is capable of\\n\\ninterpreting and modifying signals of various sorts. In a voice network, DSPs are primarily responsible for\\nencoding, decoding, and transcoding audio information. This can require a lot of computational effort.\\n Jim Dixon, \"The History of Zapata Telephony and How It Relates to the Asterisk PBX\" (http://www.asteriskdocs.org/\\n\\nmodules/tinycontent/index.php?id=10).\\n If your name is Elizabeth, for example, you will have to figure something else out like elizbth, or elizabe, or\\n\\nperhaps lizabth. OK, so liz might serve as well, but you get the point.\\n\\nMassive Change Requires Flexible Technology | 3\\n\\x0cThose are just two examples; the industry is rife with them.\\nNow, it\\'s all very well and good to pick on one system, but the reality is that every PBX\\nin existence suffers shortcomings. No matter how fully featured it is, something will\\nalways be left out, because even the most feature-rich PBX will always fail to anticipate\\nthe creativity of the customer. A small group of users will desire an odd little feature\\nthat the design team either did not think of or could not justify the cost of building,\\nand, since the system is closed, the users will not be able to build it themselves.\\nIf the Internet had been thusly hampered by regulation and commercial interests, it is\\ndoubtful that it would have developed the wide acceptance it currently enjoys. The\\nopenness of the Internet meant that anyone could afford to get involved. So, everyone\\ndid. The tens of thousands of minds that collaborated on the creation of the Internet\\ndelivered something that no corporation ever could have.\\nAs with many other open source projects, such as Linux and the Internet, the development of Asterisk was fueled by the dreams of folks who knew that there had to be\\nsomething more than what the industry was producing. The strength of the community\\nis that it is composed not of employees assigned to specific tasks, but rather of folks\\nfrom all sorts of industries, with all sorts of experiences, and all sorts of ideas about\\nwhat flexibility means, and what openness means. These people knew that if one could\\ntake the best parts of various PBXes and separate them into interconnecting components--akin to a boxful of LEGO bricks--one could begin to conceive of things that\\nwould not survive a traditional corporate risk-analysis process. While no one can seriously claim to have a complete picture of what this thing should look like, there is no\\nshortage of opinions and ideas.#\\nMany people new to Asterisk see it as unfinished. Perhaps these people can be likened\\nto visitors to an art studio, looking to obtain a signed, numbered print. They often leave\\ndisappointed, because they discover that Asterisk is the blank canvas, the tubes of paint,\\nthe unused brushes waiting.*\\nEven at this early stage in its success, Asterisk is nurtured by a greater number of artists\\nthan any other PBX. Most manufacturers dedicate no more than a few developers to\\nany one product; Asterisk has scores. Most proprietary PBXes have a worldwide support team comprised of a few dozen real experts; Asterisk has hundreds.\\nThe depth and breadth of the expertise that surrounds this product is unmatched in\\nthe telecom industry. Asterisk enjoys the loving attention of old Telco guys who\\n# From the release of Asterisk 1.2 to Asterisk 1.4, there have been over 4,000 updates to the code in the SVN\\n\\nrepository.\\n* It should be noted that these folks need not leave disappointed. Several projects have arisen to lower the\\n\\nbarriers to entry for Asterisk. By far the most popular and well known is trixbox (http://www.trixbox.org). If\\nyou have an old PC lying around (or a copy of VMware), trixbox will build a GUI-based PBX for you simply\\nby answering a few questions during the automated install process. This does not make it easier to learn\\nAsterisk, because you are no longer involved in the platform or dialplan configuration, but it will deliver a\\nworking PBX to you much faster than the more hands-on approach we employ in this book.\\n\\n4 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0cremember when rotary dial mattered, enterprise telecom people who recall when voicemail was the hottest new technology, and data communications geeks and coders\\nwho helped build the Internet. These people all share a common belief--that the telecommunications industry needs a proper revolution.\\nAsterisk is the catalyst.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Hacker\\'s PBX\\nTelecommunications companies who choose to ignore Asterisk do so at their peril. The\\nflexibility it delivers creates possibilities that the best proprietary systems can scarcely\\ndream of. This is because Asterisk is the ultimate hacker\\'s PBX.\\nIf someone asks you not to use the term hacker, refuse. This term does not belong to\\nthe mass media. They stole it and corrupted it to mean \"malicious cracker.\" It\\'s time\\nwe took it back. Hackers built the networking engine that is the Internet. Hackers built\\nthe Apple Macintosh and the Unix operating system. Hackers are also building your\\nnext telecom system. Do not fear; these are the good guys, and they\\'ll be able to build\\na system that\\'s far more secure than anything that exists today. Rather than being\\nconstricted by the dubious and easily cracked security of closed systems, the hackers\\nwill be able to quickly respond to changing trends in security and fine-tune the telephone system in response to both corporate policy and industry best practices.\\nLike other open source systems, Asterisk will be able to evolve into a far more secure\\nplatform than any proprietary system, not in spite of its hacker roots, but rather because\\nof them.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Professional\\'s PBX\\nNever in the history of telecommunications has a system so suited to the needs of\\nbusiness been available, at any price. Asterisk is an enabling technology and, as with\\nLinux, it will become increasingly rare to find an enterprise that is not running some\\nversion of Asterisk, in some capacity, somewhere in the network, solving a problem as\\nonly Asterisk can.\\nThis acceptance is likely to happen much faster than it did with Linux, though, for\\nseveral reasons:\\n Linux has already blazed the trail that led to open source acceptance. Asterisk is\\nfollowing that lead.\\n The telecom industry is crippled, with no leadership being provided by the giant\\nindustry players. Asterisk has a compelling, realistic, and exciting vision.\\n\\n The telecom industry has been predicting a revolution since before the crash; time will tell how well they\\n\\nrespond to the open source revolution.\\n\\nAsterisk: The Hacker\\'s PBX | 5\\n\\x0c End users are fed up with incompatible, limited functionality, and horrible support.\\nAsterisk solves the first two problems; entepreneurs and the community are addressing the latter.\\n\\nThe Asterisk Community\\nOne of the compelling strengths of Asterisk is the passionate community that developed\\nand supports it. This community, led by Mark Spencer of Digium, is keenly aware of\\nthe cultural significance of Asterisk, and is giddy about the future.\\nOne of the more powerful side effects caused by the energy of the Asterisk community\\nis the cooperation it has spawned among the telecommunications professionals, networking professionals, and information technology professionals who share a love for\\nthis phenomenon. While these professions have traditionally been at odds with each\\nother, in the Asterisk community they delight in each others\\' skills. The significance of\\nthis cooperation cannot be underestimated.\\nStill, if the dream of Asterisk is to be realized, the community must grow--yet one of\\nthe key challenges that the community currently faces is a rapid influx of new users.\\nThe members of the existing community, having birthed this thing called Asterisk, are\\ngenerally welcoming of new users, but they\\'ve grown impatient with being asked the\\nkinds of questions whose answers can often be obtained independently, if one is willing\\nto put forth the time needed to research and experiment.\\nObviously, new users do not fit any particular kind of mold. While some will happily\\nspend hours experimenting and reading various blogs describing the trials and tribulations of others, many people who have become enthusiastic about this technology\\nare completely uninterested in such pursuits. They want a simple, straightforward, stepby-step guide that\\'ll get them up and running, followed by some sensible examples\\ndescribing the best methods of implementing common functionality (such as voicemail,\\nauto attendants, and the like).\\nTo the members of the expert community, who (correctly) perceive that Asterisk is like\\na web development language, this approach doesn\\'t make any sense. To them, it\\'s clear\\nthat you have to immerse yourself in Asterisk to appreciate its subtleties. Would one\\nask for a step-by-step guide to programming and expect to learn from it all that a language has to offer?\\nClearly, there\\'s no one approach that\\'s right for everyone. Asterisk is a different animal\\naltogether, and it requires a totally different mind-set. As you explore the community,\\nthough, be aware that there are people with many different skill sets and attitudes here.\\nSome of these folks do not display much patience with new users, but that\\'s often due\\nto their passion for the subject, not because they don\\'t welcome your participation.\\n\\n6 | Chapter 1: A Telephony Revolution\\n\\x0cThe Asterisk Mailing Lists\\nAs with any community, there are places where members of the Asterisk community\\nmeet to discuss matters of mutual interest. Of the mailing lists you will find at http://\\nlists.digium.com, these four are currently the most important:\\nAsterisk-Biz\\nAnything commercial with respect to Asterisk belongs in this list. If you\\'re selling\\nsomething Asterisk-related, sell it here. If you want to buy an Asterisk service or\\nproduct, post here.\\nAsterisk-Dev\\nThe Asterisk developers hang out here. The purpose of this list is the discussion of\\nthe development of the software that is Asterisk, and its participants vigorously\\ndefend that purpose. Expect a lot of heat if you post anything to this list not relating\\nto programming or development of the Asterisk code base specifically. General\\ncoding questions (such as interfacing with AGI or AMI), should be directed to the\\nAsterisk-Users list.\\nThe Asterisk-Dev list is not second-level support! If you scroll\\nthrough the mailing list archives, you\\'ll see this is a strict rule. The\\nAsterisk-Dev mailing list is about discussion of core Asterisk development, and questions about interfacing your external programs via AGI or AMI should be posted on the Asterisk-Users list.\\n\\nAsterisk-Users\\nThis is where most Asterisk users hang out.

A communitymaintained repository of VoIP knowledge (http://www.voip-info.org) contains a truly\\ninspiring cornucopia of fascinating, informative, and frequently contradictory information about many subjects, just one of which is Asterisk.\\nSince Asterisk documentation forms by far the bulk of the information on this web\\nsite, and it probably contains more Asterisk knowledge than all other sources put\\ntogether (with the exception of the mailing-list archives), it is commonly referred to as\\nthe place to go for Asterisk knowledge.\\nThe Asterisk Community | 7\\n\\x0cThe IRC Channels\\nThe Asterisk community maintains Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels on\\nirc.freenode.net. The two most active channels are #asterisk and #asterisk-dev. To cut\\ndown on spam-bot intrusions, both of these channels now require registration to join.\\n\\nAsterisk User Groups\\nIn many cites around the world, lonely Asterisk users began to realize that there were\\nother like-minded people in their towns. Asterisk User Groups (AUGs) began to spring\\nup all over the place.

Type \"Asterisk User Group\" into Google to track down one in your area.\\n\\nThe Asterisk Documentation Project\\nThe Asterisk Documentation Project was started by Leif Madsen and Jared Smith, but\\nseveral people in the community have contributed.\\nThe goal of the documentation project is to provide a structured repository of written\\nwork on Asterisk. In contrast with the flexible and ad hoc nature of the Wiki, the Docs\\nproject is passionate about building a more focused approach to various\\nAsterisk-related subjects.\\nAs part of the efforts of the Asterisk Docs project to make documentation available\\nonline, this book is available at the http://www.asteriskdocs.org web site, under a Creative Commons license.\\n\\nThe Business Case\\nIt is very rare to find businesses these days that do not have to reinvent themselves every\\nfew years. It is equally rare to find a business that can afford to replace its communications infrastructure each time it goes in a new direction. Today\\'s businesses need\\nextreme flexibility in all of their technology, including telecom.\\nIn his book Crossing the Chasm (HarperBusiness), Geoffrey Moore opines, \"The idea\\nthat the value of the system will be discovered rather than known at the time of installation implies, in turn, that product flexibility and adaptability, as well as ongoing\\naccount service, should be critical components of any buyer\\'s evaluation checklist.\"\\n More than 30 percent, at last count.\\n The #asterisk-dev channel is for the discussion of changes to the underlying code base of Asterisk and is also\\n\\nnot second-tier support.

Well, when it comes to Asterisk, there is far more to talk about than\\nwe can fit into one book. For now, we\\'re not going to take you down all the roads that\\nthe ber-geeks follow--we\\'re just going to give you the basics.\\nIn Chapter 2, we cover some of the engineering considerations you should keep in mind\\nwhen designing a telecommunications system. You can skip much of this material if\\nyou want to get right to installing, but these are important concepts to understand,\\nshould you ever plan on putting an Asterisk system into production.\\nChapter 3 covers obtaining, compiling, and installing Asterisk, and Chapter 4 deals\\nwith the initial configuration of Asterisk. Here we cover the important configuration\\nfiles that must exist to define the channels and features available to your system. This\\nwill prepare you for Chapter 5, where we introduce the heart of Asterisk--the dialplan.\\nChapter 6 will introduce some more advanced dialplan concepts.\\nWe will take a break from Asterisk in Chapter 7 and discuss some of the more important\\ntechnologies in use in the PSTN. Naturally, following the discussion of legacy\\ntelephony, Chapter 8 discusses Voice over IP.\\nChapter 9 introduces one of the more amazing components, the Asterisk Gateway\\nInterface (AGI). Using Perl, PHP, and Python, we demonstrate how external programs\\ncan be used to add nearly limitless functionality to your PBX. In Chapter 14, we briefly\\ncover what is, in fact, a rich and varied cornucopia of incredible features and functions,\\nall of which are part of the Asterisk phenomenon. To conclude, Chapter 15 looks forward, predicting a future where open source telephony completely transforms an\\nindustry desperately in need of a revolution. You\\'ll also find a wealth of reference information in the book\\'s five appendixes.\\nThis book can only lay down the basics, but from this foundation you will be able to\\ncome to an understanding of the concept of Asterisk--and from that, who knows what\\nyou will build?\\n\\nThis Book | 9\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nPreparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\nVery early on, I knew that someday in some \"perfect\"\\nfuture out there over the horizon, it would be commonplace for computers to handle all of the necessary processing functionality internally, making the necessary\\nexternal hardware to connect up to telecom interfaces\\nvery inexpensive and, in some cases, trivial.\\n--Jim Dixon, \"The History of Zapata Telephony and\\nHow It Relates to the Asterisk PBX\"\\n\\nBy this point, you must be anxious to get your Asterisk system up and running. If you\\nare building a hobby system, you can probably jump right to the next chapter and begin\\nthe installation. For a mission-critical deployment, however, some thought must be\\ngiven to the environment in which the Asterisk system will run. Make no mistake:\\nAsterisk, being a very flexible piece of software, will happily and successfully install on\\nnearly any Linux platform you can conceive of, and several non-Linux platforms as\\nwell.* However, to arm you with an understanding of the type of operating environment\\nAsterisk will really thrive in, this chapter will discuss issues you need to be aware of in\\norder to deliver a reliable, well-designed system.\\nIn terms of its resource requirements, Asterisk\\'s needs are similar to those of an embedded, real-time application. This is due in large part to its need to have priority access\\nto the processor and system buses. It is, therefore, imperative that any functions on the\\nsystem not directly related to the call-processing tasks of Asterisk be run at a low priority, if at all. On smaller systems and hobby systems, this might not be as much of an\\nissue. However, on high-capacity systems, performance shortcomings will manifest as\\naudio quality problems for users, often experienced as echo, static, and the like. The\\nsymptoms will resemble those experienced on a cell phone when going out of range,\\n* People have successfully compiled and run Asterisk on WRAP boards, Linksys WRT54G routers, Soekris\\n\\nsystems, Pentium 100s, PDAs, Apple Macs, Sun SPARCs, laptops, and more. Of course, whether you would\\nwant to put such a system into production is another matter entirely. (Actually, the AstLinux distribution,\\nby Kristian Kielhofner, runs very well indeed on the Soekris 4801 board. Once you\\'ve grasped the basics of\\nAsterisk, this is something worth looking into further. Check out http://www.astlinux.org.)\\n\\n\\x0calthough the underlying causes will be different. As loads increase, the system will have\\nincreasing difficulty maintaining connections. For a PBX, such a situation is nothing\\nshort of disastrous, so careful attention to performance requirements is a critical consideration during the platform selection process.\\nTable 2-1 lists some very basic guidelines that you\\'ll want to keep in mind when planning your system. The next section takes a close look at the various design and\\nimplementation issues that will affect its performance.\\nThe size of an Asterisk system is actually not dictated by the number of\\nusers or sets, but rather by the number of simultaneous calls it will be\\nexpected to support. These numbers are very conservative, so feel free\\nto experiment and see what works for you.\\nTable 2-1. System requirement guidelines\\nPurpose\\n\\nNumber of channels\\n\\nMinimum recommended\\n\\nHobby system\\n\\nNo more than 5\\n\\n\\nSOHO system (small office/home office--\\nless than three lines and five sets)\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall business system\\n\\nUp to 25\\n\\n\\nMedium to large system\\n\\nMore than 25\\n\\nDual CPUs, possibly also multiple servers in a distributed architecture\\n\\nWith large Asterisk installations, it is common to deploy functionality across several\\nservers. One or more central units will be dedicated to call processing; these will be\\ncomplemented by one or more ancillary servers handling peripherals (such as a database system, a voicemail system, a conferencing system, a management system, a web\\ninterface, a firewall, and so on). As is true in most Linux environments, Asterisk is well\\nsuited to growing with your needs: a small system that used to be able to handle all\\nyour call-processing and peripheral tasks can be distributed among several servers when\\nincreased demands exceed its abilities. Flexibility is a key reason why Asterisk is extremely cost-effective for rapidly growing businesses; there is no effective maximum or\\nminimum size to consider when budgeting the initial purchase. While some scalability\\nis possible with most telephone systems, we have yet to hear of one that can scale as\\nflexibly as Asterisk. Having said that, distributed Asterisk systems are not simple to\\ndesign--this is not a task for someone new to Asterisk.\\n\\n12 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cIf you are sure that you need to set up a distributed Asterisk system, you\\nwill want to study the DUNDi protocol, Asterisk Realtime Architecture\\n(ARA), func_odbc, and the various other database tools at your disposal. This will help you to abstract the data your system requires from the\\ndialplan logic your Asterisk systems will utilize, allowing a generic set\\nof dialplan logic that can be used across multiple boxes, thereby allowing you to scale more simply by adding additional boxes to the system.\\nHowever, this is far beyond the scope of this book and will be left as an\\nexercise for the reader. If you want a teaser of some tools you can use\\nfor scaling, see Chapter 12.\\n\\nA Set of Load Test Results\\nJoshua Colp was able to produce the results in Table 2-2 on an AMD Athlon64 X2 4200\\n+ with 1 GB RAM and 80 GB SATA hard drive, testing with the default scenario in\\nthe SIPp application: a simple call setup, Playback() an audio file, and Wait() a short\\ntime. Notice the massive savings in CPU utilization while reading data from the RAM\\ndisk versus the hard drive. This could be interpreted as the CPU waiting for data to\\nprocess before delivering it to the requesting channel. However, this is just a simple\\ntest and in no way reflects the amount of calls your system will be able to handle. You\\nare encouraged to load test your own system to determine the number of simultaneous\\ncalls that can be handled utilizing your dialplan and combination of applications.\\nTable 2-2.

When selecting\\nyour hardware, you must carefully consider the overall design of your system and what\\nfunctionality you need to support. This will help you determine your requirements for\\nthe CPU, motherboard, and power supply. If you are simply setting up your first\\nAsterisk system for the purpose of learning, you can safely ignore the information in\\nthis section. If, however, you are building a mission-critical system suitable for deployment, these are issues that require some thought.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 13\\n\\x0cPerformance Issues\\nAmong other considerations, when selecting the hardware for an Asterisk installation\\nyou must bear in mind this critical question: how powerful must the system be? This\\nis not an easy question to answer, because the manner in which the system is to be used\\nwill play a big role in the resources it will consume. There is no such thing as an Asterisk\\nperformance-engineering matrix, so you will need to understand how Asterisk uses the\\nsystem in order to make intelligent decisions about what kinds of resources will be\\nrequired. You will need to consider several factors, including:\\nThe maximum number of concurrent connections the system will be expected to support\\nEach connection will increase the workload on the system.\\nThe percentage of traffic that will require processor-intensive DSP of compressed codecs\\n(such as G.729 and GSM)\\nThe Digital Signal Processing (DSP) work that Asterisk performs in software can\\nhave a staggering impact on the number of concurrent calls it will support. A system\\nthat might happily handle 50 concurrent G.711 calls could be brought to its knees\\nby a request to conference together 10 G.729 compressed channels. We\\'ll talk more\\nabout G.729, GSM, G.711, and many other codecs in Chapter 8.\\nWhether conferencing will be provided, and what level of conferencing activity is expected\\nWill the system be used heavily? Conferencing requires the system to transcode\\nand mix each individual incoming audio stream into multiple outgoing streams.\\nMixing multiple audio streams in near-real-time can place a significant load on the\\nCPU.\\nEcho cancellation\\nEcho cancellation may be required on any call where a Public Switched Telephone\\nNetwork (PSTN) interface is involved. Since echo cancellation is a mathematical\\nfunction, the more of it the system has to perform, the higher the load on the CPU\\nwill be.  Do not fear. Echo cancellation is another topic for Chapter 8.\\nDialplan scripting logic\\nWhenever Asterisk has to pass call control to an external program, there is a performance penalty. As much logic as possible should be built into the dialplan. If\\nexternal scripts are used, they should be designed with performance and efficiency\\nas critical considerations.\\nAs for the exact performance impact of these factors, it\\'s difficult to know for sure. The\\neffect of each is known in general terms, but an accurate performance calculator has\\nnot yet been successfully defined. This is partly because the effect of each component\\nof the system is dependent on numerous variables, such as CPU power, motherboard\\nchipset and overall quality, total traffic load on the system, Linux kernel optimizations,\\nnetwork traffic, number and type of PSTN interfaces, and PSTN traffic--not to mention\\n\\n Roughly 30 MHz of CPU power per channel.\\n\\n14 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cany non-Asterisk services the system is performing concurrently. Let\\'s take a look at\\nthe effects of several key factors:\\nCodecs and transcoding\\nSimply put, a codec (short for coder/decoder, or compression/decompression) is a\\nset of mathematical rules that define how an analog waveform will be digitized.\\nThe differences between the various codecs are due in large part to the levels of\\ncompression and quality that they offer. Generally speaking, the more compression\\nthat\\'s required, the more work the DSP must do to code or decode the signal.\\nUncompressed codecs, therefore, put far less strain on the CPU (but require more\\nnetwork bandwidth). Codec selection must strike a balance between bandwidth\\nand processor usage.\\nCentral processing unit (and Floating Point Unit)\\nA CPU is comprised of several components, one of which is the floating point unit\\n(FPU). The speed of the CPU, coupled with the efficiency of its FPU, will play a\\nsignificant role in the number of concurrent connections a system can effectively\\nsupport. The next section (\"Choosing a Processor) offers some general guidelines\\nfor choosing a CPU that will meet the needs of your system.\\nOther processes running concurrently on the system\\nBeing Unix-like, Linux is designed to be able to multitask several different processes. A problem arises when one of those processes (such as Asterisk) demands\\na very high level of responsiveness from the system. By default, Linux will distribute\\nresources fairly among every application that requests them. If you install a system\\nwith many different server applications, those applications will each be allowed\\ntheir fair use of the CPU. Since Asterisk requires frequent high-priority access to\\nthe CPU, it does not get along well with other applications, and if Asterisk must\\ncoexist with other apps, the system may require special optimizations. This primarily involves the assignment of priorities to various applications in the system\\nand, during installation, careful attention to which applications are installed as\\nservices.\\nKernel optimizations\\nA kernel optimized for the performance of one specific application is something\\nthat very few Linux distributions offer by default and, thus, it requires some\\nthought. At the very minimum--whichever distribution you choose--a fresh copy\\nof the Linux kernel (available from http://www.kernel.org) should be downloaded\\nand compiled on your platform. You may also be able to acquire patches that will\\nyield performance improvements, but these are considered hacks to the officially\\nsupported kernel.\\nIRQ latency\\nInterrupt request (IRQ) latency is basically the delay between the moment a peripheral card (such as a telephone interface card) requests the CPU to stop what\\nit\\'s doing and the moment when the CPU actually responds and is ready to handle\\nthe task. Asterisk\\'s peripherals (especially the Zaptel cards) are extremely intolerServer Hardware Selection | 15\\n\\x0cant of IRQ latency. This is not due to any problem with the cards so much as part\\nof the nature of how a software-based TDM engine has to work. If we buffer the\\nTDM data and send it on the bus as a larger packet, that may be more efficient\\nfrom a system perspective, but it will create a delay between the time the audio is\\nreceived on the card, and when it is delivered to the CPU. This makes real-time\\nprocessing of TDM data next to impossible. In the design of Zaptel, it was decided\\nthat sending the data every 1 ms would create the best trade-off, but a side effect\\nof this is that any card in the system that uses the Zaptel interface is going to ask\\nthe system to process an interrupt every millisecond. This used to be a factor on\\nolder motherboards, but it has largely ceased to be a cause for concern.\\nLinux has historically had problems with its ability to service IRQs\\nquickly; this problem has caused enough trouble for audio developers that several patches have been created to address this shortcoming. So far, there has been some mild controversy over how to\\nincorporate these patches into the Linux kernel.\\n\\nKernel version\\nAsterisk is officially supported on Linux Version 2.6.\\nLinux distribution\\nLinux distributions are many and varied. In the next chapter, we will discuss the\\nchallenge of selecting a Linux distribution, and how to obtain and install both\\nLinux and Asterisk.\\n\\nChoosing a Processor\\nSince the performance demands of Asterisk will generally involve a large number of\\nmath calculations, it is essential that you select a processor with a powerful FPU. The\\nsignal processing that Asterisk performs can quickly demand a staggering quantity of\\ncomplex mathematical computations from the CPU. The efficiency with which these\\ntasks are carried out will be determined by the power of the FPU within the processor.\\nTo actually name a best processor for Asterisk in this book would fly in the face of\\nMoore\\'s law. Even in the time between the authoring and publishing of this book,\\nprocessor speeds will undergo rapid improvements, as will Asterisk\\'s support for various architectures. Obviously, this is a good thing, but it also makes the giving of advice\\non the topic a thankless task. Naturally, the more powerful the FPU is, the more\\nconcurrent DSP tasks Asterisk will be able to handle, so that is the ultimate consideration. When you are selecting a processor, the raw clock speed is only part of the\\nequation. How well it handles floating-point operations will be a key differentiator, as\\nDSP operations in Asterisk will place a large demand on that process.\\nBoth Intel and AMD CPUs have powerful FPUs. Current-generation chips from either\\nof those manufacturers can be expected to perform well.\\n16 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cThe obvious conclusion is that you should get the most powerful CPU your budget will\\nallow. However, don\\'t be too quick to buy the most expensive CPU out there. You\\'ll\\nneed to keep the requirements of your system in mind; after all, a Formula 1 Ferrari is\\nill-suited to the rigors of rush-hour traffic. Slower CPUs will often run cooler and, thus,\\nyou might be able to build a lower-powered, fanless Asterisk system for a small office,\\nwhich could work well in a dusty environment, perhaps.\\nIn order to attempt to provide a frame of reference from which we can contemplate our\\nplatform decision, we have chosen to define three sizes of Asterisk systems: small,\\nmedium, and large.\\n\\nSmall systems\\nSmall systems (up to 10 phones) are not immune to the performance requirements of\\nAsterisk, but the typical load that will be placed on a smaller system will generally fall\\nwithin the capabilities of a modern processor.\\nIf you are building a small system from older components you have lying around, be\\naware that the resulting system cannot be expected to perform at the same level as a\\nmore powerful machine, and will run into performance degradation under a much\\nlighter load. Hobby systems can be run successfully on very low-powered hardware,\\nalthough this is by no means recommended for anyone who is not a whiz at Linux\\nperformance tuning.\\nIf you are setting up an Asterisk system for the purposes of learning, you will be able\\nto build a fully featured platform using a relatively low-powered CPU. The authors of\\nthis book run several Asterisk lab systems with 433 MHz to 700 MHz Celeron processors, but the workload of these systems is minimal (never more than two concurrent\\ncalls).\\n\\nAstLinux and Asterisk on OpenWRT\\nIf you are really comfortable working with Linux on embedded platforms, you will want\\nto join the AstLinux mailing list and run Kristian Kielhofner\\'s creation, AstLinux, or\\nget yourself a Linksys WRT54GL and install Brian Capouch\\'s version of Asterisk for\\nthat platform.\\nThese projects strip Asterisk down to its essentials, and allow incredibly powerful PBX\\napplications to be deployed on very inexpensive hardware.\\n If you want to be completely up to the minute on which CPUs are leading the performance race, surf on over\\n\\nto Tom\\'s Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com) or AnandTech (http://www.anandtech.com), where you\\nwill find a wealth of information about both current and out-of-date CPUs, motherboards, and chipsets.\\n Greg Boehnlein once compiled and ran Asterisk on a 133 MHz Pentium system, but that was mostly as an\\n\\nexperiment. Performance problems are far more likely, and properly configuring such a system requires an\\nexpert knowledge of Linux. We do not recommend running Asterisk on anything less than a 500 MHz system\\n(for a production system, 2 GHz might be a sensible minimum). Still, we think the fact that Asterisk is so\\nflexible is remarkable.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 17\\n\\x0cWhile both projects require a fair amount of knowlege and effort on your part, they\\nalso share a huge coolness factor, are extrememly popular, and are of excellent quality.\\n\\nMedium systems\\nMedium-sized systems (from 10 to 50 phones) are where performance considerations\\nwill be the most challenging to resolve. Generally, these systems will be deployed on\\none or two servers only and, thus, each machine will be required to handle more than\\none specific task. As loads increase, the limits of the platform will become increasingly\\nstressed. Users may begin to perceive quality problems without realizing that the system\\nis not faulty in any way, but simply exceeding its capacity. These problems will get\\nprogressively worse as more and more load is placed on the system, with the user experience degrading accordingly. It is critical that performance problems be identified\\nand addressed before they are noticed by users.\\nMonitoring performance on these systems and quickly acting on any developing trends\\nis key to ensuring that a quality telephony platform is provided.\\n\\nLarge systems\\nLarge systems (more than 120 channels) can be distributed across multiple systems and\\nsites and, thus, performance concerns can be managed through the addition of machines. Very large Asterisk systems have been created in this way.\\nBuilding a large system requires an advanced level of knowledge in many different\\ndisciplines. We will not discuss it in detail in this book, other than to say that the issues\\nyou\\'ll encounter will be similar to those encountered during any deployment of multiple servers handling a single, distributed task.\\n\\nChoosing a Motherboard\\nJust to get any anticipation out of the way, we also cannot recommend specific motherboards in this book. With new motherboards coming out on a weekly basis, any\\nrecommendations we could make would be rendered moot by obsolescence before the\\npublished copy hit the shelves. Not only that, but motherboards are like automobiles:\\nwhile they are all very similar in principle, the difference is in the details. And as Asterisk\\nis a performance application, the details matter.\\nWhat we will do, therefore, is give you some idea of the kinds of motherboards that\\ncan be expected to work well with Asterisk, and the features that will make for a good\\nmotherboard. The key is to have both stability and high performance. Here are some\\nguidelines to follow:\\n The various system buses must provide the minimum possible latency. If you are\\nplanning a PSTN connection using analog or PRI interfaces (discussed later in this\\nchapter), having Zaptel cards in the system will generate 1,000 interrupt requests\\n18 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cper second. Having devices on the bus that interfere with this process will result\\nin degradation of call quality. Chipsets from Intel (for Intel CPUs) and nVidia\\nnForce (for AMD CPUs) seem to score the best marks in this area. Review the\\nspecific chipset of any motherboard you are evaluating to ensure that it does not\\nhave known problems with IRQ latency.\\n If you are running Zaptel cards in your system, you will want to ensure that your\\nBIOS allows you maximum control over IRQ assignment. As a rule, high-end\\nmotherboards will offer far greater flexibility with respect to BIOS tweaking; valuepriced boards will generally offer very little control. This may be a moot point,\\nhowever, as APIC-enabled motherboards turn IRQ control over to the operating\\nsystem.\\n Server-class motherboards generally implement a different PCI standard than\\nworkstation-class motherboards. While there are many differences, the most obvious and well known is that the two versions have different voltages. Depending\\non which cards you purchase, you will need to know if you require 3.3V or 5V PCI\\nslots. Figure 2-1 shows the visual differences between 3.3V and 5V slots. Most\\nserver motherboards will have both types, but workstations will typically have only\\nthe 5V version.\\nThere is some evidence that suggests connecting together two completely separate, single-CPU systems may provide far more benefits\\nthan simply using two processors in the same machine. You not\\nonly double your CPU power, but you also achieve a much better\\nlevel of redundancy at a similar cost to a single-chassis, dual-CPU\\nmachine. Keep in mind, though, that a dual-server Asterisk solution will be more complex to design than a single-machine solution.\\n\\n Consider using multiple processors, or processors with multiple cores. This will\\nprovide an improvement in the system\\'s ability to handle multiple tasks. For Asterisk, this will be of special benefit in the area of floating-point operations.\\n If you need a modem, install an external unit that connects to a serial port. If you\\nmust have an internal modem, you will need to ensure that it is not a so-called\\n\"Win-modem\"--it must be a completely self-sufficient unit (note that these are\\nvery difficult, if not impossible, to find).\\n Consider that with built-in networking, if you have a network component failure,\\nthe entire motherboard will need to be replaced. On the other hand, if you install\\na peripheral Network Interface Card (NIC), there may be an increased chance of\\n With the advent of PCI-X and PCI-Express, it is becoming harder and harder to select a motherboard with\\n\\nthe correct type of slots. Be very certain that the motherboard you select has the correct type and quantity of\\ncard slots for your hardware. Keep in mind that most companies that produce hardware cards for Asterisk\\noffer PCI and PCI-Express versions, but it\\'s still up to you to make sure they make sense in whatever\\nmotherboard and chassis combination you choose.\\n\\nServer Hardware Selection | 19\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-1. Visual identification of PCI slots\\n\\nfailure due to the extra mechanical connections involved. It can also be useful to\\nhave separate network cards serving sets and users (the internal network) and VoIP\\nproviders and external sites (the external network). NICs are cheap; we suggest\\nalways having at least two.\\n The stability and quality of your Asterisk system will be dependent on the components you select for its architecture. Asterisk is a beast, and it expects to be fed\\nthe best. As with just about anything, high cost is not always synonymous with\\nquality, but you will want to become a connoisseur of computer components.\\nHaving said all that, we need to get back to the original point: Asterisk can and will\\nhappily install on pretty much any system that will run Linux. The lab systems used to\\nwrite this book, for example, included everything from a Linksys WRT to a dual-Xeon\\nlocomotive.# We have not experienced any performance or stability problems running\\nless than five concurrent telephone connections. For the purposes of learning, do not\\nbe afraid to install Asterisk on whatever system you can scrounge up. When you are\\nready to put your system into production, however, you will need to understand the\\nramifications of the choices you make with respect to your hardware.\\n\\nPower Supply Requirements\\nOne often-overlooked component in a PC is the power supply (and the supply of power). For a telecommunications system,* these components can play a significant role in\\nthe quality of the user experience.\\n# OK, it wasn\\'t actually a locomotive, but it sure sounded like one. Does anyone know where to get quiet CPU\\n\\nfans for Xeon processors? It\\'s getting too loud in the lab here.\\n* Or any system that is expected to process audio.\\n\\n20 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cComputer power supplies\\nThe power supply you select for your system will play a vital role in the stability of the\\nentire platform. Asterisk is not a particularly power-hungry application, but anything\\nrelating to multimedia (whether it be telephony, professional audio, video, or the like)\\nis generally sensitive to power quality.\\nThis oft-neglected component can turn an otherwise top-quality system into a poor\\nperformer. By the same token, a top-notch power supply might enable an otherwise\\ncheap PC to perform like a champ.\\nThe power supplied to a system must provide not only the energy the system needs to\\nperform its tasks but also stable, clean signal lines for all of the voltages your system\\nexpects from it.\\nSpend the money and get a top-notch power supply (gamers are pretty passionate about\\nthis sort of thing, so there are lots of choices out there).\\n\\nRedundant power supplies\\nIn a carrier-grade or high-availability environment, it is common to deploy servers that\\nuse a redundant power supply. Essentially, this involves two completely independent\\npower supplies, either one of which is capable of meeting the power requirements of\\nthe system.\\nIf this is important to you, keep in mind that best practices suggest that to be properly\\nredundant, these power supplies should be connected to completely independent uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes) that are in turn fed by totally separate electrical\\ncircuits. In truly mission-critical environments (such as hospitals), even the main electrical feeds into the building are redundant, and diesel-powered generators are on-site\\nto generate electricity during extended power failures (such as the one that hit Northeastern North America on August 15, 2003).\\n\\nEnvironment\\nYour system\\'s environment consists of all of those factors that are not actually part of\\nthe server itself but nevertheless play a crucial role in the reliability and quality that can\\nbe expected from the system. Electrical supplies, room temperature and humidity,\\nsources of interference, and security are all factors that should be contemplated.\\n\\nPower Conditioning and Uninterruptible Power Supplies\\nWhen selecting the power sources for your system, consideration should be given not\\nonly to the amount of power the system will use, but also to the manner in which this\\npower is delivered.\\n\\nEnvironment | 21\\n\\x0cPower is not as simple as voltage coming from the outlet in the wall, and you should\\nnever just plug a production system into whatever electrical source is near at\\nhand.Giving some consideration to the supply of power to your system can provide a\\nfar more stable power environment, leading to a far more stable system.\\nOne of the benefits of clean power is a reduction in heat, which means less stress on\\ncomponents, leading to a longer life expectancy.\\nProperly grounded, conditioned power feeding a premium-quality power supply will\\nensure a clean logic ground (a.k.a. 0 volt) reference for the system and keep electrical\\nnoise on the motherboard to a minimum. These are industry-standard best practices\\nfor this type of equipment, which should not be neglected. A relatively simple way to\\nachieve this is through the use of a power-conditioned UPS.\\n\\nPower-conditioned UPSes\\nThe UPS is well known for its role as a battery backup, but the power-conditioning\\nbenefits that high-end UPS units also provide are less well understood.\\nPower conditioning can provide a valuable level of protection from the electrical environment by regenerating clean power through an isolation transformer. A quality\\npower conditioner in your UPS will eliminate most electrical noise from the power feed\\nand help to ensure a rock-steady supply of power to your system.\\nUnfortunately, not all UPS units are created equal; many of the less expensive units do\\nnot provide clean power. What\\'s worse, manufacturers of these devices will often\\npromise all kinds of protection from surges, spikes, overvoltages, and transients. While\\nsuch devices may protect your system from getting fried in an electrical storm, they will\\nnot clean up the power being fed to your system and, thus, will do nothing to contribute\\nto stability.\\nMake sure your UPS is power conditioned. If it doesn\\'t say exactly that, it isn\\'t.\\n\\nGrounding\\nVoltage is defined as the difference in electrical potential between two points. When\\nconsidering a ground (which is basically nothing more than an electrical path to earth),\\nthe common assumption is that it represents 0 volts. But if we do not define that 0V in\\n\\n Okay, look, you can plug it in wherever you\\'d like, and it\\'ll probably work, but if your system has strange\\n\\nstability problems, please give this section another read. Deal?\\n In electronic devices, a binary zero (0) is generally related to a 0 volt signal, while a binary one (1) can be\\n\\nrepresented by many different voltages (commonly between 2.5 and 5 volts). The grounding reference that\\nthe system will consider 0 volts is often referred to as the logic ground. A poorly grounded system might have\\nelectrical potential on the logic ground to such a degree that the electronics mistake a binary zero for a binary\\none. This can wreak havoc with the system\\'s ability to process instructions.\\n It is a common misconception belief that all UPSes provide clean power. This is not at all true.\\n\\n22 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0crelation to something, we are in danger of assuming things that may not be so. If you\\nmeasure the voltage between two grounding references, you\\'ll often find that there is\\na voltage potential between them. This voltage potential between grounding points can\\nbe significant enough to cause logic errors--or even damage--in a system where more\\nthan one path to ground is present.\\nOne of the authors recalls once frying a sound card he was trying to\\nconnect to a friend\\'s stereo system. Even though both the computer and\\nthe stereo were in the same room, more than 6 volts of difference was\\nmeasured between the ground conductors of the two electrical outlets\\nthey were plugged into! The wire between the stereo and the PC (by way\\nof the sound card) provided a path that the voltage eagerly followed,\\nthus frying a sound card that was not designed to handle that much\\ncurrent on its signal leads. Connecting both the PC and the stereo to the\\nsame outlet fixed the problem.\\n\\nWhen considering electrical regulations, the purpose of a ground is primarily human\\nsafety. In a computer, the ground is used as a 0V logic reference. An electrical system\\nthat provides proper safety will not always provide a proper logic reference--in fact,\\nthe goals of safety and power quality are sometimes in disagreement. Naturally, when\\na choice must be made, safety has to take precedence.\\nSince the difference between a binary zero and a binary one is represented in computers by voltage differences of sometimes less than 3V, it is\\nentirely possible for unstable power conditions caused by poor grounding or electrical noise to cause all kinds of intermittent system problems.\\nSome power and grounding advocates estimate that more than 80 percent of unexplained computer glitches can be traced to power quality.\\nMost of us blame Microsoft.\\n\\nModern switching power supplies are somewhat isolated from power quality issues,\\nbut any high-performance system will always benefit from a well-designed power environment. In mainframes, proprietary PBXes, and other expensive computing\\nplatforms, the grounding of the system is never left to chance. The electronics and\\nframes of these systems are always provided with a dedicated ground that does not\\ndepend on the safety grounds supplied with the electrical feed.\\nRegardless of how much you are willing to invest in grounding, when you specify the\\nelectrical supply to any PBX, ensure that the electrical circuit is completely dedicated\\nto your system (as discussed in the next section) and that an insulated, isolated grounding conductor is provided. This can be expensive to provision, but it will contribute\\ngreatly to a quality power environment for your system.\\nIt is also vital that each and every peripheral you connect to your system be connected\\nto the same electrical receptacle (or, more specifically, the same ground reference). This\\nEnvironment | 23\\n\\x0cwill cut down on the occurrence of ground loops, which can cause anything from\\nbuzzing and humming noises to damaged or destroyed equipment.\\n\\nElectrical Circuits\\nIf you\\'ve ever seen the lights dim when an electrical appliance kicks in, you\\'ve seen the\\neffect that a high-energy device can have on an electrical circuit. If you were to look at\\nthe effects of a multitude of such devices, each drawing power in its own way, you\\nwould see that the harmonically perfect 50 or 60 Hz sine wave you may think you\\'re\\ngetting with your power is anything but. Harmonic noise is extremely common on\\nelectrical circuits , and it can wreak havoc on sensitive electronic equipment. For a PBX,\\nthese problems can manifest as audio problems, logic errors, and system instability.\\nIdeally, you should never install a server on an electrical circuit that is shared with other\\ndevices. There should be only one outlet on the circuit, and you should connect only\\nyour telephone system (and associated peripherals) to it. The wire (including the\\nground) should be run unbroken directly back to the electrical panel. The grounding\\nconductor should be insulated and isolated. There are far too many stories of photocopiers, air conditioners, and vacuum cleaners wreaking havoc with sensitive electronics to ignore this rule of thumb.\\nThe electrical regulations in your area must always take precedence over\\nany ideas presented here. If in doubt, consult a power quality expert in\\nyour area on how to ensure that you adhere to electrical regulations.\\nRemember, electrical regulations take into account the fact that human\\nsafety is far more important than the safety of the equipment.\\n\\nThe Equipment Room\\nEnvironmental conditions can wreak havoc on systems, and yet it is quite common to\\nsee critical systems deployed with little or no attention given to these matters. When\\nthe system is installed, everything works well, but after as little as six months, components begin to fail. Talk to anyone with experience in maintaining servers and systems,\\nand it becomes obvious that attention to environmental factors can play a significant\\nrole in the stability and reliability of systems.\\n\\nHumidity\\nSimply put, humidity is water in the air. Water is a disaster for electronics for two main\\nreasons: 1) water is a catalyst for corrosion, and 2) water is conductive enough that it\\n\\n On a hobby system, this is probably too much to ask, but if you are planning on using Asterisk for anything\\n\\nimportant, at least be sure to give it a fighting chance; don\\'t put anything like air conditioners, photocopiers,\\nlaser printers, or motors on the same circuit. The strain such items place on your power supply will shorten\\nits life expectancy.\\n\\n24 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0ccan cause short circuits. Do not install any electronic equipment in areas of high humidity without providing a means to remove the moisture.\\n\\nTemperature\\nHeat is the enemy of electronics. The cooler you keep your system, the more reliably\\nit will perform, and the longer it will last. If you cannot provide a properly cooled room\\nfor your system, at a minimum ensure that it is placed in a location that ensures a steady\\nsupply of clean, cool air. Also, keep the temperature steady. Changes in temperature\\ncan lead to condensation and other damaging changes.\\n\\nDust\\nAn old adage in the computer industry holds that dust bunnies inside of a computer\\nare lucky. Let\\'s consider some of the realities of dust bunnies:\\n Significant buildup of dust can restrict airflow inside the system, leading to increased levels of heat.\\n Dust can contain metal particles, which, in sufficient quantities, can contribute to\\nsignal degradation or shorts on circuit boards.\\nPut critical servers in a filtered environment, and clean out dust bunnies on a regular\\nschedule.\\n\\nSecurity\\nServer security naturally involves protecting against network-originated intrusions, but\\nthe environment also plays a part in the security of a system. Telephone equipment\\nshould always be locked away, and only persons who have a need to access the equipment should be allowed near it.\\n\\nTelephony Hardware\\nIf you are going to connect Asterisk to any traditional telecommunications equipment,\\nyou will need the correct hardware. The hardware you require will be determined by\\nwhat it is you want to achieve.\\n\\nConnecting to the PSTN\\nAsterisk allows you to seamlessly bridge circuit-switched telecommunications networks# with packet-switched data networks.* Because of Asterisk\\'s open architecture\\n(and open source code), it is ultimately possible to connect any standards-compliant\\n\\n# Often referred to as TDM networks, due to the Time Division Multiplexing used to carry traffic through the\\n\\nPSTN.\\n\\nTelephony Hardware | 25\\n\\x0cinterface hardware. The selection of open source telephony interface boards is currently\\nlimited, but as interest in Asterisk grows, that will rapidly change. At the moment, one\\nof the most popular and cost-effective ways to connect to the PSTN is to use the interface cards that evolved from the work of the Zapata Telephony Project (http://www.za\\npatatelephony.org).\\n\\nAnalog interface cards\\nUnless you need a lot of channels (or a have lot of money to spend each month on\\ntelecommunications facilities), chances are that your PSTN interface will consist of one\\nor more analog circuits, each of which will require a Foreign eXchange Office (FXO)\\nport.\\nDigium, the company that sponsors Asterisk development, produces analog interface\\ncards for Asterisk. Check out its web site for its extensive line of analog cards, including\\nthe venerable TDM400P, the latest TDM800P, and the high-density TDM2400P. As\\nan example, the TDM800P is an eight-port base card that allows for the insertion of up\\nto two daughter cards, which each deliver either four FXO or four FXS ports. The\\nTDM800P can be purchased with these modules preinstalled, and a hardware echocanceller can be added as well.

The original Tormenta cards are now\\nconsidered obsolete, but they do still work with Asterisk.\\nDigium makes several different digital circuit interface cards. The features on the cards\\nare the same; the primary differences are whether they provide T1 or E1 interfaces, and\\nhow many spans each card provides. Digium has been producing Zaptel cards for Linux\\nlonger than anyone else, as they were deeply involved with the development of Zaptel\\non Linux, and have been the driving force behind Zaptel development over the years.\\nSangoma, which has been producing open source WAN cards for many years, added\\nAsterisk support for its T1/E1 cards a few years ago. Rhino has had T1 hardware for\\nAsterisk for a while now, and there are many other companies that offer digital interface\\ncards for Asterisk as well.\\n\\nChannel banks\\nA channel bank is loosely defined as a device that allows a digital circuit to be demultiplexed into several analog circuits (and vice versa). More specifically, a channel\\nbank lets you connect analog telephones and lines into a system across a T1 line.\\nFigure 2-2 shows how a channel bank fits into a typical office phone system.\\nAlthough they can be expensive to purchase, many people feel very strongly that the\\nonly proper way to integrate analog circuits and devices into Asterisk is through a\\nchannel bank. Whether that is true or not depends on a lot of factors, but if you have\\nthe budget, they can be very useful.# You can often pick up used channel banks on\\neBay.

Don\\'t forget that you will need a T1 card in order to connect a channel bank to\\nAsterisk.\\n\\nOther types of PSTN interfaces\\nMany VoIP gateways exist that can be configured to provide access to PSTN circuits.\\nGenerally speaking, these will be of most use in a smaller system (one or two lines).\\nThey can also be very complicated to configure, as grasping the interaction between\\nthe various networks and devices requires a solid understanding of both telephony and\\nVoIP fundamentals. For that reason, we will not discuss these devices in detail in this\\nbook. They are worth looking into, however; popular units are made by Sipura, Grandstream, Digium, and many other companies.\\nAnother way to connect to the PSTN is through the use of Basic Rate Interface (BRI)\\nISDN circuits. BRI is a digital telecom standard that specifies a two-channel circuit that\\ncan carry up to 144 Kbps of traffic. It is very rarely used in North America, but in Europe\\nit is very widely deployed. Due to the variety of different ways this technology has been\\nimplemented, and a lack of testing equipment, we will not be discussing BRI in very\\nmuch detail in this book. Please note, however, that BRI is very popular in Europe, and\\nDigium has produced the B410P card to address this need.\\n\\nConnecting Exclusively to a Packet-Based Telephone Network\\nIf you do not need to connect to the PSTN, Asterisk requires no hardware other than\\na server with a Network Interface Card (NIC).\\nHowever, if you are going to be providing music on hold* or conferencing and you have\\nno physical timing source, you will need the ztdummy Linux kernel module.\\nztdummy is a clocking mechanism designed to provide a timing source to a system\\nwhere no hardware timing source exists. Think of it as a kind of metronome to allow\\nthe system to mix multiple audio streams in a properly synchronized manner.\\n\\nEcho Cancellation\\nOne of the issues that can arise if you use analog interfaces on a VoIP system is echo.\\nEcho is simply what you say being reflected back to you a short time later. The echo is\\ncaused by the far end, but you are the one that hears it. It is a little known fact that echo\\nwould be a massive problem in the PSTN were it not for the fact that the carriers employ\\ncomplex (and expensive) strategies to eliminate it.

Also, echo cancellation in software imposes a load on\\nthe processor; hardware echo cancellers built into the PSTN card take this burden away\\nfrom the CPU.\\nHardware echo cancellation can add several hundred dollars to your equipment cost,\\nbut if you are serious about having a quality system, invest the extra money now instead\\nof suffering later. Echo problems are not pleasant at all, and your users will hate the\\nsystem if they experience it.\\nAs of this writing, several software echo cancellers have become available. We have not\\nhad a chance to evaluate any of them, but we know that they employ the same algorythems the hardware echo cancellers do. If you have a recently purchased Digium analog\\ncard, you can call Digium sales for a keycode to allow its latest software echo canceller\\nto work with your system. There are other software options available for other types\\nof cards, but you will have to look into whether you have to purchase a license to use\\nthem. Keep in mind that there is a performance cost to using software echo cancellers.\\nThey will place a measureable load on the CPU that needs to be taken into account\\nwhen you design a system using these technologies.\\n\\nTypes of Phones\\nSince the title of this book is Asterisk: The Future of Telephony, we would be remiss if\\nwe didn\\'t discuss the devices that all of this technology ultimately has to interconnect:\\ntelephones!\\nWe all know what a telephone is--but will it be the same five years from now? Part of\\nthe revolution that Asterisk is contributing to is the evolution of the telephone, from a\\nsimple audio communications device into a multimedia communications terminal providing all kinds of yet-to-be-imagined functions.\\nAs an introduction to this exciting concept, we will briefly discuss the various kinds of\\ndevices we currently call \"telephones\" (any of which can easily be integrated with Asterisk). We will also discuss some ideas about what these devices may evolve into in\\nthe future (devices that will also easily integrate with Asterisk).\\n\\n This software is not part of a normal Asterisk download because Digium has to pay to license it separately.\\n\\nNevertheless, it has grandfathered it into all of its cards, so it is available for free to anyone who has a Digium\\nanalog card that is still under warranty. If you are running a non-Digium analog card, you can purchase a\\nkeycode for this software echo canceller from Digium\\'s web site.\\n Sangoma also offers free software echo cancellation on their analog cards (up to six channels).\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 29\\n\\x0cPhysical Telephones\\nAny physical device whose primary purpose is terminating an on-demand audio communications circuit between two points can be classified as a physical telephone. At a\\nminimum, such a device has a handset and a dial pad; it may also have feature keys, a\\ndisplay screen, and various audio interfaces.\\nThis section takes a brief look at the various user (or endpoint) devices you might want\\nto connect to your Asterisk system. We\\'ll delve more deeply into the mechanics of\\nanalog and digital telephony in Chapter 7.\\n\\nAnalog telephones\\nAnalog phones have been around since the invention of the telephone. Up until about\\n20 years ago, all telephones were analog. Although analog phones have some technical\\ndifferences in different countries, they all operate on similar principles.\\nThis contiguous connection is referred to as a circuit, which the\\ntelephone network used to use electromechanical switches to create--\\nhence the term circuit-switched network.\\n\\nWhen a human being speaks, the vocal cords, tongue, teeth, and lips create a complex\\nvariety of sounds. The purpose of the telephone is to capture these sounds and convert\\nthem into a format suitable for transmission over wires. In an analog telephone, the\\ntransmitted signal is analogous to the sound waves produced by the person speaking.\\nIf you could see the sound waves passing from the mouth to the microphone, they\\nwould be proportional to the electrical signal you could measure on the wire.\\nAnalog telephones are the only kind of phone that are commonly available in any retail\\nelectronics store. In the next few years, that can be expected to change dramatically.\\n\\nProprietary digital telephones\\nAs digital switching systems developed in the 1980s and 1990s, telecommunications\\ncompanies developed digital Private Branch eXchanges (PBXes) and Key Telephone\\nSystems (KTSes). The proprietary telephones developed for these systems were completely dependent on the systems to which they were connected and could not be used\\non any other systems. Even phones produced by the same manufacturer were not crosscompatible (for example, a Nortel Norstar set will not work on a Nortel Meridian 1\\nPBX). The proprietary nature of digital telephones limits their future. In this emerging\\nera of standards-based communications, they will quickly be relegated to the dustbin\\nof history.\\nThe handset in a digital telephone is generally identical in function to the handset in\\nan analog telephone, and they are often compatible with each other. Where the digital\\n\\n30 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cphone is different is that inside the telephone, the analog signal is sampled and converted into a digital signal--that is, a numerical representation of the analog waveform.\\nWe\\'ll leave a detailed discussion of digital signals until Chapter 7; for now, suffice it to\\nsay that the primary advantage of a digital signal is that it can be transmitted over\\nlimitless distances with no loss of signal quality.\\nThe chances of anyone ever making a proprietary digital phone directly compatible\\nwith Asterisk are slim, but companies such as Citel (http://www.citel.com) have created\\ngateways that convert the proprietary signals to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).\\n\\nISDN telephones\\nPrior to VoIP, the closest thing to a standards-based digital telephone was an ISDNBRI terminal. Developed in the early 1980s, ISDN was expected to revolutionize the\\ntelecommunications industry in exactly the same way that VoIP promises to finally\\nachieve today.\\nThere are two types of ISDN: Primary Rate Interface (PRI) and\\nBasic Rate Interface (BRI). PRI is commonly used to provide trunking\\nfacilities between PBXes and the PSTN, and is widely deployed all over\\nthe world. BRI is not at all popular in North America, but is common\\nin Europe.\\n\\nWhile ISDN was widely deployed by the telephone companies, many consider the\\nstandard to have been a flop, as it generally failed to live up to its promises. The high\\ncosts of implementation, recurring charges, and lack of cooperation among the major\\nindustry players contributed to an environment that caused more problems than it\\nsolved.\\nBRI was intended to service terminal devices and smaller sites (a BRI loop provides two\\ndigital circuits). A wealth of BRI devices have been developed, but BRI has largely been\\ndeprecated in favor of faster, less expensive technologies such as ADSL, cable modems,\\nand VoIP.\\nBRI is still very popular for use in video-conferencing equipment, as it provides a fixed\\nbandwidth link. Also, BRI does not have the type of quality of service issues a VoIP\\nconnection might, as it is circuit-switched.\\n\\n Citel has produced a fantastic product that is limited by the fact that it is too expensive. If you have old\\n\\nproprietary PBX telephones, and you want to use them with your Asterisk system, Citel\\'s technology can do\\nthe job, but make sure you understand how the per-port cost of these units stacks up against replacing the\\nold sets with pure VoIP telephones.\\n The SIP is currently the most well-known and popular protocol for VoIP. We will discuss it further in\\n\\nChapter 8.\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 31\\n\\x0cBRI is still sometimes used in place of analog circuits to provide trunking to a PBX.\\nWhether or not this is a good idea depends mostly on how your local phone company\\nprices the service, and what features it is willing to provide.#\\n\\nIP telephones\\nIP telephones are heralds of the most exciting change in the telecommunications industry. Already now, standards-based IP telephones are available in retail stores. The\\nwealth of possibilities inherent in these devices will cause an explosion of interesting\\napplications, from video phones to high-fidelity broadcasting devices, to wireless mobility solutions, to purpose-built sets for particular industries, to flexible all-in-one\\nmultimedia systems.\\nThe revolution that IP telephones will spawn has nothing to do with a new type of wire\\nto connect your phone to, and everything to do with giving you the power to communicate the way you want.\\nThe early-model IP phones that have been available for several years now do not represent the future of these exciting appliances. They are merely a stepping-stone, a\\nfamiliar package in which to wrap a fantastic new way of thinking.\\nThe future is far more promising.\\n\\nSoftphones\\nA softphone is a software program that provides telephone functionality on a non-telephone device, such as a PC or PDA. So how do we recognize such a beast? What might\\nat first glance seem a simple question actually raises many. A softphone should probably\\nhave some sort of dial pad, and it should provide an interface that reminds users of a\\ntelephone. But will this always be the case?\\nThe term softphone can be expected to evolve rapidly, as our concept of what exactly\\na telephone is undergoes a revolutionary metamorphosis.* As an example of this evolution, consider the following: would we correctly define popular communication\\nprograms such as Instant Messenger as softphones? IM provides the ability to initiate\\nand receive standards-based VoIP connections. Does this not qualify it as a softphone?\\nAnswering that question requires knowledge of the future that we do not yet possess.\\nSuffice it to say that while at this point in time, softphones are expected to look and\\nsound like traditional phones, that conception is likely to change in the very near future.\\nAs standards evolve and we move away from the traditional telephone and toward a\\nmultimedia communications culture, the line between softphones and physical telephones will become blurred indeed. For example, we might purchase a communica# If you are in North America, give up on this idea, unless you have a lot of patience and money, and are a bit\\n\\nof a masochist.\\n* Ever heard of Skype?\\n\\n32 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0ctions terminal to serve as a telephone and install a softphone program onto it to provide\\nthe functions we desire.\\nHaving thus muddied the waters, the best we can do at this point is to define what the\\nterm softphone will refer to in relation to this book, with the understanding that the\\nmeaning of the term can be expected to undergo a massive change over the next few\\nyears. For our purposes, we will define a softphone as any device that runs on a personal\\ncomputer, presents the look and feel of a telephone, and provides as its primary function\\nthe ability to make and receive full-duplex audio communications (formerly known as\\n\"phone calls\") through E.164 addressing.\\n\\nTelephony Adaptors\\nA telephony adaptor (usually referred to as an ATA, or Analog Terminal Adaptor) can\\nloosely be described as an end-user device that converts communications circuits from\\none protocol to another. Most commonly, these devices are used to convert from some\\ndigital (IP or proprietary) signal to an analog connection that you can plug a standard\\ntelephone or fax machine into.\\nThese adaptors could be described as gateways, for that is their function. However,\\npopular usage of the term telephony gateway would probably best describe a multiport\\ntelephony adaptor, generally with more complicated routing functions.\\nTelephony adaptors will be with us for as long as there is a need to connect incompatible\\nstandards and old devices to new networks. Eventually, our reliance on these devices\\nwill disappear, as did our reliance on the modem--obsolescence through irrelevance.\\n\\nCommunications Terminals\\nCommunications terminal is an old term that disappeared for a decade or two and is\\nbeing reintroduced here, very possibly for no other reason than that it needs to be\\ndiscussed so that it can eventually disappear again--once it becomes ubiquitous.\\nFirst, a little history. When digital PBX systems were first released, manufacturers of\\nthese machines realized that they could not refer to their endpoints as telephones--\\ntheir proprietary nature prevented them from connecting to the PSTN. They were\\ntherefore called terminals, or stations. Users, of course, weren\\'t having any of it. It\\nlooked like a telephone and acted like a telephone, and therefore it was a telephone.\\nYou will still occasionally find PBX sets referred to as terminals, but for the most part\\nthey are called telephones.\\n\\n OK, so you think you know what a phone call is? So did we. Let\\'s just wait a few years, shall we?\\n E.164 is the ITU standard that defines how phone numbers are assigned. If you\\'ve used a telephone, you\\'ve\\n\\nused E.164 addressing.\\n\\nTypes of Phones | 33\\n\\x0cThe renewed relevance of the term communications terminal has nothing to do with\\nanything proprietary--rather, it\\'s the opposite. As we develop more creative ways of\\ncommunicating with each other, we gain access to many different devices that will allow\\nus to connect. Consider the following scenarios:\\n If I use my PDA to connect to my voicemail and retrieve my voice messages (converted to text), does my PDA become a phone?\\n If I attach a video camera to my PC, connect to a company\\'s web site, and request\\na live chat with a customer service rep, is my PC now a telephone?\\n If I use the IP phone in my kitchen to surf for recipes, is that a phone call?\\nThe point is simply this: we\\'ll probably always be \"phoning\" each other, but will we\\nalways be using \"telephones\" to do so?\\n\\nLinux Considerations\\nIf you ask anyone at the Free Software Foundation, they will tell you that what we know\\nas Linux is in fact GNU/Linux. All etymological arguments aside, there is some valuable\\ntruth to this statement. While the kernel of the operating system is indeed Linux, the\\nvast majority of the utilities installed on a Linux system and used regularly are in fact\\nGNU utilities. \"Linux\" is probably only 5 percent Linux, possibly 75 percent GNU,\\nand perhaps 20 percent everything else.\\nWhy does this matter? Well, the flexibility of Linux is both a blessing and a curse. It is\\na blessing because with Linux you can truly craft your very own operating system from\\nscratch. Since very few people ever do this, the curse is in large part due to the responsibility you must bear in determining which of the GNU utilities to install, and how to\\nconfigure the system.\\nIf this seems overwhelming, do not fear. In the next chapter, we will discuss the selection, installation, and configuration of the software environment for your Asterisk\\nsystem.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ve discussed all manner of issues that can contribute to the stability\\nand quality of an Asterisk installation. Before we scare you off, we should tell you that\\nmany people have installed Asterisk on top of a graphical Linux workstation--running\\na web server, a database, and who knows what else--with no problems whatsoever.How much time and effort you should devote to following the best practices and\\n\\n Just don\\'t ever install the X-windowing environment (which is anything that delivers a desktop, such as\\n\\nGNOME, KDE, and such). You are almost guaranteed to have audio quality problems, as Asterisk and the\\nGUI will fight for control of the CPU.\\n\\n34 | Chapter 2: Preparing a System for Asterisk\\n\\x0cengineering tips in this chapter all depends on how much work you expect the Asterisk\\nserver to perform, and how much quality and reliability your system must provide. If\\nyou are experimenting with Asterisk, don\\'t worry too much; just be aware that any\\nproblems you have may not be the fault of the Asterisk system.\\nWhat we have attempted to do in this chapter is give you a feel for the kinds of best\\npractices that will help to ensure that your Asterisk system will be built on a reliable,\\nstable platform. Asterisk is quite willing to operate under far worse conditions, but the\\namount of effort and consideration you decide to give these matters will play a part in\\nthe stability of your PBX. Your decision should depend on how critical your Asterisk\\nsystem will be.\\n\\nConclusion | 35\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nInstalling Asterisk\\n\\nI long to accomplish great and noble tasks, but it is my\\nchief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they\\nwere great and noble. The world is moved along, not\\nonly by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the\\naggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.\\n--Helen Keller\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed preparing a system to install Asterisk. Now it\\'s\\ntime to get our hands dirty!\\nAlthough a large number of Linux* distributions and PC architectures are excellent\\ncandidates for Asterisk, we have chosen to focus on a single distribution in order to\\nmaintain brevity and clarity throughout the book. The instructions that follow have\\nbeen made as generic as possible, but you will notice a leaning toward CentOS directory\\nstructure and system utilities. We have chosen to focus on CentOS (arguably, the most\\npopular distro for Asterisk) because its command set, directory structure, and so forth\\nare likely to be familiar to a larger percentage of readers (we have found that many\\nLinux administrators are familiar with CentOS, even if they don\\'t prefer it). This doesn\\'t\\nmean that CentOS is the only choice, or even the best one for you. A question that often\\nappears on the mailing lists is: \"Which distribution of Linux is the best to use with\\nAsterisk?\" The multitude of answers generally boils down to \"the one you like the\\nbest.\"\\n\\n* And some non-Linux operating systems as well, such as Solaris, *BSD, and OS X. You should note that while\\n\\npeople have managed to successfully run Asterisk on these alternative systems, Asterisk was, and continues\\nto be, actively developed for Linux.\\n We will be using CentOS Server 4.4 in this book, which we usually install with nothing except the Editors\\n\\npackage selected. If you are not sure what distribution to choose, CentOS is an excellent choice. CentOS can\\nbe obtained from http://www.centos.org.\\n\\n\\x0cWhat Packages Do I Need?\\nMost Asterisk configurations are composed of three main packages : the main Asterisk\\nprogram (asterisk), the Zapata telephony drivers (zaptel), and the PRI libraries (libpri).\\nIf you plan on a pure VoIP network, the only real requirement is the asterisk package,\\nbut we recommend installing all three packages; you can choose what modules to activate later. The zaptel drivers are required if you are using analog or digital hardware,\\nor if you\\'re using the ztdummy driver (discussed later in this chapter) as a timing source.\\nThe libpri library is optional unless you\\'re using ISDN PRI interfaces, and you may save\\na small amount of RAM if you don\\'t load it, but we recommend that it be installed in\\nconjunction with the zaptel package for completeness.\\nIn the first edition of this book, we recommended that you install the additional\\nasterisk-sounds package. This was a separate compressed archive that you would\\ndownload, extract, and then install. As of Asterisk version 1.4.0, there are now two sets\\nof sounds packages: the Core Sound package and the Extra Sound package. Since Asterisk supports several different audio formats, these packages can be obtained in a\\nnumber of different sound formats, such as G.729 and GSM. The reason for all of the\\ndifferent formats is that Asterisk can use the sound format that requires the least amount\\nof CPU transcode. For example, if you have a lot of connections coming in on VoIP\\nchannels that are running GSM, you would want to have the GSM version of the sound\\nfiles. You can select one or more sound prompt types in the menuselect screen (discussed later in this chapter). We recommend that you install at least one type of sounds\\nfile from both the Core Sound package and Extra Sound package menu items. Since\\nwe may make use of some of the Extra Sound files throughout this book, we will assume\\nyou have at least one of the formats installed.\\n\\nLinux Package Requirements\\nTo compile Asterisk, you must have the GCC compiler (version 3.x or later) and its\\ndependencies on your system. Asterisk also requires bison, a parser generator program\\nthat replaces yacc, and ncurses for CLI functionality. The cryptographic library in Asterisk requires OpenSSL and its development packages.\\nZaptel requires libnewt and its development packages for the zttool program (see \"Using\\nztcfg and zttool later in this chapter). If you\\'re using PRI interfaces, Zaptel also requires\\nthe libpri package (again, even if you aren\\'t using PRI circuits, we recommend that you\\ninstall libpri along with zaptel).\\nIf you install the Software Development packages in CentOS, you will have all of these\\ntools. If you are looking to keep things trim, and wish to install the bare minimum to\\ncompile Asterisk and its related packages, Table 3-1 will prove useful.\\n\\n38 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cIn the following table, the -y switch to the yum application means to\\nanswer yes to all prompts, and using it will install the application and\\nall dependencies without prompting you. If this is not what you want,\\nomit the -y switch.\\nIf you just want to install all of the above packages in one go, you can\\nspecify more than one package on the command line, e.g.:\\n# yum install -y gcc ncurses-devel libtermcap-devel [...]\\n\\nTable 3-1.

Note that Asterisk will\\nno longer build correctly unless you have at least version 3.80 of GNU make.\\n\\nWhat Packages Do I Need? | 39\\n\\x0cObtaining the Source Code\\nThe best place to get source code for Asterisk and it\\'s packages is directly from the\\nhttp://www.asterisk.org web site or FTP server.\\n\\nRelease Versus Trunk\\nThe Asterisk code base is under a constant state of change. Developers use a sofware\\nrevision tool called Subversion (SVN) to manage the code base. Subversion allows a\\ncommunty of developers to collaborate with each other on complex programming\\nprojects.\\nThere are two main areas where Asterisk is developed, and these are referred to as the\\nBranch and the Trunk. In the Trunk, new features, architectural changes, and any of\\nthe brand-new stuff that is going on is performed. This place in the code base contains\\nall the new toys, but at any time can be in a nonworking state, and is absolutely forbidden from production use (see figure).\\n\\n\\nTrunk\\n\\nJust like a tree, a Trunk will have Branches. These Branches have the major revision\\nnumbers such as 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 (in the future we will likely see 1.6, 1.8, 1.8.2, 1.8.4.\\n1.8.6, 1.8.8. 1.8.8.2...um...etc...). Within the Branch there are no major architectural\\nchanges or new features--simply bug and security fixes. In a production environment,\\nstability is far more important than feature evolution.\\nRoughly every 14 months (although Asterisk does not follow a formal release timeline\\nlike many commercial software packages), a version of Asterisk is released intended for\\nuse in production environments. The first version of Asterisk was 1.0, which was released at the very first AstriCon in Atlanta in September of 2004. Asterisk 1.2 was\\nreleased at IP4IT in November 2005, and Asterisk 1.4 was released in December of\\n2006.\\n\\nObtaining Asterisk Source Code\\nThe easiest way to obtain the most recent release is through the use of the program\\nwget.\\n Subversion is an excellent code management system, available at http://subversion.tigris.org/. It also has an equally\\n\\nexcellent Creative Commons released book, Version Control with Subversion, by Ben Collins Sussman et al.\\n(O\\'Reilly), available online at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/.\\n As of the release date of this book, there has been no determination that the next Asterisk release will be 1.6. It\\n\\ncould just as easily be 2.0. Therefore, when discussing new features, you\\'ll see us talk about what\\'s in Trunk or\\nwhat will be in the next release--without mentioning the specific version.\\n\\n40 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cNote that we will be making use of the /usr/src/ directory to extract and compile the\\nAsterisk source, although some system administrators may prefer to use /usr/local/src.\\nAlso be aware that you will need root access to write files to the /usr/src/ directory and\\nto install Asterisk and its associated packages.\\nSee Chapter 13 for information on running Asterisk as non-root. All\\nsecurity professionals will recommend that you run your daemons as a\\nnon-root user in case there are security vulnerabilities in the software.\\nThis helps to lower (but obviously does not eliminate) the risk of someone compromising the root user.\\n\\nTo obtain the latest release source code via wget, enter the following commands on the\\ncommand line:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\n\\nThe latest versions of the asterisk, libpri, and zaptel packages may not\\nnecessarily be the same version number.\\n\\nAlternatively, during development and testing you will probably want to work with the\\nlatest branch. To check it out from SVN, run:\\n# svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.4 asterisk-1.4\\n\\nIf you retrieved the described source code via the release files on the Digium FTP server,\\nthen extract the files as described in the next section before continuing on with\\ncompiling.\\n\\nExtracting the Source Code\\nThe packages you downloaded from the FTP server are compressed archives containing\\nthe source code; thus, you will need to extract them before compiling. If you didn\\'t\\ndownload the packages to /usr/src/, either move them there now or specify the full path\\nto their location. We will be using the GNU tar application to extract the source code\\nfrom the compressed archive. This is a simple process that can be achieved through the\\nuse of the following commands:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\ntar zxvf zaptel-1.4-current.tar.gz\\ntar zxvf libpri-1.4-current.tar.gz\\ntar zxvf asterisk-1.4-current.tar.gz\\n\\nObtaining the Source Code | 41\\n\\x0cIn bash (and other shell systems which support it), you can use an extremely handy feature called Tab completion. This will allow you to type\\npart of a filename and have the rest of it completed automatically. For\\nexample, if you type tar zxvf zap<tab> that will complete the full\\nzaptel filename for you. If more than one filename matches the pattern\\nand you hit Tab twice, it will list the files matching that pattern.\\n\\nThese commands will extract the packages and source code to their respective directories. When you extract the asterisk-1.4-current.tar.gz file, you will find that the file\\nwill extract to the current version of Asterisk, i.e. asterisk-1.4.4.\\nIt\\'s always a good idea to keep the source code of the most recently\\nworking version of a package in case you have to \"roll back\" out of a\\nnew bug introduced, or some other strange behavior you can\\'t solve\\nimmediately.\\n\\nMenuselect\\nIn the 1.4.0 version of Asterisk and its related packages, a new build system,\\nautoconf, was implemented. This has changed the build process slightly, but has given\\nmore flexibilty to control what modules are being built at build time. This has an advantage in that we only have to build the modules we want and need instead of building\\neverything.\\nAlong with the new build system, a new menu-based selection system was introduced,\\ncourtesy of Russell Bryant. This new system permits a finer-grained selection to which\\nmodules are built before compiling the software and no longer requires the user to edit\\nMakefiles. So instead of discussing how to use menuselect in every \"Compiling ...\"\\nsection, we will discuss it here, so when you see make menuselect you will understand\\nwhat to do once inside the menuselect configuration screen.\\nIn Figure 3-1, we see the opening menuselect screen for the Asterisk software. Other\\npackages will look extremely similar, but with less options. We can navigate up and\\ndown the list using the arrow keys. We can select one of the menu options by pressing\\nEnter or by using the right arrow key. The left arrow key can be used to go back.\\nFigure 3-2 shows a list of possible dialplan applications that can be built for use in\\nAsterisk. Modules to be built are marked as [*]. A module is marked as not being built\\nby [ ]. Modules that have XXX in front of them are missing a package dependency which\\nmust be satisfied before it will be available to be built. In Figure 3-2, we can see that\\nthe app_flash module cannot be built due to a missing dependency of Zaptel (i.e., the\\nZaptel module has not been built and installed on the system since the last\\ntime ./configure was run). If you have satisfied a dependency since the last time you\\n\\n42 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cFigure 3-1. Sample menuselect screen\\n\\nran ./configure, then run it again, and rerun menuselect. Your module should now be\\navailable for building.\\nAfter you have finished making changes to menuselect, type x to save and quit. q will\\nalso quit out of menuselect, but it will not save the changes. If you make changes and\\ntype q, your changes may be lost!\\n\\nCompiling Zaptel\\nFigure 3-3 shows the layers of interaction between Asterisk and the Linux kernel with\\nrespect to hardware control. On the Asterisk side is the Zapata channel module,\\nchan_zap. Asterisk uses this interface to communicate with the Linux kernel, where\\nthe drivers for the hardware are loaded.\\nThe Zaptel interface is a kernel loadable module that presents an abstraction layer\\nbetween the hardware drivers and the Zapata module in Asterisk. It is this concept that\\nallows the device drivers to be modified without any changes being made to the Asterisk\\nCompiling Zaptel | 43\\n\\x0cFigure 3-2. List of modules to be built\\n\\nsource itself. The device drivers are used to communicate with the hardware directly\\nand to pass the information between Zaptel and the hardware.\\nWhile Asterisk itself compiles on a variety of platforms, the Zaptel drivers are Linux-specific--they are written to interface directly with the\\nLinux kernel. There is a project at http://www.solarisvoip.com that provides Zaptel support for Solaris. There is also a project that is working\\nto provide Zapata drivers for BSD, located at http://www.voip-info.org/\\ntiki-index.php?page=FreeBSD+zaptel.\\n\\nFirst we will discuss the ztdummy driver, used on systems that require a timing interface\\nbut that do not have hardware. Then we will look at compiling and installing the drivers.\\n(The configuration of Zaptel drivers will be discussed in the next chapter.)\\n\\n44 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\n\\nchan_zap.so\\n\\n/dev/zap\\n\\nLinux kernel\\n\\nZaptel\\n\\nHardware driver\\n(wctdm)\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nFigure 3-3. Layers of device interaction with Asterisk\\nBefore compiling the Zaptel drivers on a system running a Linux 2.4\\nkernel, you should verify that /usr/src/ contains a symbolic link named\\nlinux-2.4 pointing to your kernel source. If the symbolic link doesn\\'t\\nexist, you can create it with the following command (assuming you\\'ve\\ninstalled the source in /usr/src/):\\n# ln -s /usr/src/\\'uname -r\\' /usr/src/linux-2.4\\n\\nComputers running Linux 2.6 kernel-based distributions do not usually\\nrequire the use of the symbolic link, as these distributions will search\\nfor the kernel build directory automatically. However, if you\\'ve placed\\nthe build directory in a nonstandard place (i.e., somewhere other\\nthan /lib/modules/ <kernel version> /build/), you will require the use of\\nthe symbolic link.\\nWhile Asterisk and the other related packages run on Linux 2.4.x kernels, development is done first and foremost on 2.6.x kernels and\\nsupport for 2.4.x kernels is not guarenteed in the future.\\n\\nThe ztdummy Driver\\nIn Asterisk, certain applications and features require a timing device in order to operate\\n(Asterisk won\\'t even compile them if no timing device is found). All Digium PCI hardware provides a 1 kHz timing interface that satisfies this requirement. If you lack the\\nPCI hardware required to provide timing, the ztdummy driver can be used as a timing\\ndevice. On Linux 2.4 kernel-based distributions, ztdummy must use the clocking provided by the UHCI USB controller.\\nCompiling Zaptel | 45\\n\\x0cMany older systems (and some newer ones) use an OHCI USB controller\\nchip, which is incompatible with ztdummy. However, if you\\'re using a\\n2.6 kernel there is no need to worry about which USB controller chip\\nyour system has.\\n\\nThe driver looks to see that the usb-uhci module is loaded and that the kernel version\\nis at least 2.4.5. Older kernel versions are incompatible with ztdummy.\\nOn a 2.6 kernel-based distribution, ztdummy does not require the use of the USB controller. (As of v2.6.0, the kernel now provides 1 kHz timing with which the driver can\\ninterface; thus, the USB controller hardware requirement is no longer necessary.)\\n\\nThe Zapata Telephony Drivers\\nCompiling the Zapata telephony drivers for use with your Digium hardware is straightforward; however, the method employed between the 1.2 and 1.4 versions is slightly\\ndifferent due to the new build environment. First we need to run ./configure in order\\nto determine what applications and libraries are installed on the system. This will ensure\\nthat everything Zaptel needs is installed. The following commands will build Zaptel\\nand its modules:\\n# cd /usr/src/zaptel-version\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake clean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake\\nmake install\\n\\nWhile running make clean is not always necessary, it\\'s a good idea to\\nrun it before recompiling any of the modules, as it will remove the compiled binary files from within the source code directory. You can also\\nuse it to clean up after installing if you don\\'t like to leave the compiled\\nbinaries floating around. Note that this removes the binaries only from\\nthe source directory, not from the system.\\nIn addition to the executables, make clean also removes the intermediary\\nfiles (i.e., the object files) after compilation. You don\\'t need them occupying space on your hard drive.\\n\\nIf you\\'re using a system that makes use of the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d/ directories\\n(such as CentOS and other Red Hat-based distros), you may wish to run the make con\\n\\n Note that this is configurable in the kernel, so it is possible certain distributions may not have this set to 1,000\\n\\nHz; CentOS, however, does have this set at the correct frequency.\\n\\n46 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cfig command as well. This will install the startup scripts and configure the system,\\nusing the chkconfig command to load the zaptel module automatically at startup:\\n# make config\\n\\nThe Debian equivalent of chkconfig is update-rc.d.\\nWhile Digium only officially supports Zaptel on Linux, several projects\\nto port Zaptel to other platforms should be noted:\\n Solaris (http://www.solarisvoip.com)\\n BSD (http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/asterisk-bsd)\\n\\nUsing ztcfg and zttool\\nTwo programs installed along with Zaptel are ztcfg and zttool. The ztcfg program is\\nused to read the configuration in /etc/zaptel.conf to configure the hardware. The\\nzttool program can be used to check the status of your installed hardware. For instance,\\nif you are using a T1 card and there is no communication between the endpoints, you\\nwill see a red alarm. If everything is configured correctly and communication is possible,\\nyou should see an \"OK.\" The zttool application is also useful for analog cards, because\\nit tells you their current state (configured, off-hook, etc.). The use of these programs\\nwill be explored further in the next chapter.\\nThe libnewt libraries and their development packages (newt-devel on\\nRed Hat-based distributions) must be installed for zttool to be compiled.\\nThe ztcfg and zttool applications, along with other useful utilities, are\\nlocated under the Utilities section of the Zaptel menuselect screen.\\n\\nCompiling libpri\\nThe libpri libraries do not make use of the autoconf build environment or the menuselect feature as they are unnecessary; thus, the installation is simplified. libpri is used\\nby various makers of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) hardware, but even if you\\ndon\\'t have the hardware installed, it is safe to compile and install this library. You must\\ncompile and install libpri before Asterisk, as it will be detected and used when Asterisk\\nis compiled. Here are the commands (replace version with your version of libpri):\\n# cd /usr/src/libpri-version\\n# make clean\\n# make\\n# make install\\n\\nCompiling libpri | 47\\n\\x0cCompiling Asterisk\\nOnce you\\'ve compiled and installed the zaptel and libpri packages (if you need them),\\nyou can move on to Asterisk. This section walks you through a standard installation\\nand introduces some of the alternative make arguments that you may find useful.\\n\\nStandard Installation\\nAsterisk is compiled with gcc through the use of the GNU make program. To get started\\ncompiling Asterisk, simply run the following commands (replace version with your\\nversion of Asterisk):\\n# cd /usr/src/asterisk-version\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake clean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake install\\nmake samples\\n\\nBe aware that compile times will vary between systems. On a current-generation processor, you shouldn\\'t need to wait more than five minutes. At AstriCon (http://\\nwww.astricon.net), someone reported successfully compiling Asterisk on a 133 MHz\\nPentium, but it took approximately five hours. You do the math.\\nRun the make samples command to install the default configuration files. Installing these\\nfiles (instead of configuring each file manually) will allow you to get your Asterisk\\nsystem up and running much faster. Many of the default values are fine for Asterisk.\\nFiles that require editing will be explained in future chapters.\\nIf you already have configuration files installed in /etc/asterisk/ when you\\nrun the make samples command, .old will be appended to the end of each\\nof your current configuration files, for example, extensions.conf will be\\nrenamed extensions.conf.old. Be careful, though, because if you run make\\nsamples more than once you will overwrite your original configuration\\nfiles!\\nThe sample configuration files can also be found in the configs/ subdirectory within your Asterisk sources directory.\\n\\nIf you\\'re using a system that makes use of the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d/ directories,\\nyou may wish to run the make config command as well. This will install the startup\\nscripts and configure the system (through the use of the chkconfig command) to execute\\nAsterisk automatically at startup:\\n# make config\\n\\n48 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cAlternative make Arguments\\nThere are several other make arguments that you can pass at compile time. While some\\nof these will be discussed here, the remainder are used internally within the file and\\nreally have no bearing or use for the end user. (Of course, new functions may have been\\nadded, so be sure to check the Makefile for other options.)\\nLet\\'s take a look at some useful make arguments.\\n\\nmake clean\\nThe make clean command is used to remove the compiled binaries from within the\\nsource directory. This command should be run before you attempt to recompile or, if\\nspace is an issue, if you would like to clean up the files.\\n\\nmake distclean\\nThe make distclean command is used to remove the compiled binaries and to clean\\nthe source directory back to its original state after being extracted from the compressed\\narchive.\\n\\nmake update\\nThe make update command is used to update the existing code from the Digium SVN\\nserver. If you downloaded the source code from the FTP server, you will receive a notice\\nstating so.\\n\\nmake webvmail\\nThe Asterisk Web Voicemail script is used to give a graphical interface to your voicemail\\naccount, allowing you to manage and interact with your voicemail remotely from a web\\nbrowser.\\nWhen you run the make webvmail command, the Asterisk Web Voicemail script will be\\nplaced into the cgi-bin/ directory of your HTTP daemon. If you have specific policies\\nwith respect to security, be aware that it uses a setuid root Perl script. This command\\nwill install only on a CentOS or Fedora box, as other distributions may have different\\npaths to their cgi-bin/ directories. (This, of course, can be changed by editing the\\nHTTP_CFGDIR variable in the Makefile at line 133 at the time of this writing.)\\n\\nmake progdocs\\nThe make progdocs command will create documentation using the doxygen software\\nfrom comments placed within the source code by the developers. You must have the\\nappropriate doxygen software installed on your system in order for this to work. Note\\nthat doxygen assumes that the source code is well documented, which, sadly, is not\\nalways the case, although much work was published since the first edition of this book!\\nThe information contained within the doxygen system will be useful only to developers.\\nCompiling Asterisk | 49\\n\\x0cmake config\\nThe make config command will install Red Hat-style initialization scripts, if\\nthe /etc/rc.d/init.d or /etc/init.d directories are found to exist. If they do exist, the scripts\\nare installed with file permissions equal to 755. If the script detects\\nthat /etc/rc.d/init.d/ exists, the chkconfig --add asterisk command will also be run to\\ncause Asterisk to be started automatically at boot time. This is not the case, however,\\nwith distributions that only use the /etc/init.d/ directory. Running make config will not\\ndo anything to an already running Asterisk process, or start one if it\\'s not running.\\nThis script currently is really only useful on a Red Hat-based system, although initialization scripts are available for other distributions (such as Gentoo, Mandrake, and\\nSlackware) in the ./contrib./init.d/ directory of your Asterisk source directory.\\n\\nUsing Precompiled Binaries\\nWhile the documented process of installing Asterisk expects you to compile the source\\ncode yourself, there are Linux distributions (such as Debian) that include precompiled\\nAsterisk binaries. Failing that, you may be able to install Asterisk with the package\\nmanagers that those distributions of Linux provide (such as apt-get for Debian and\\nportage for Gentoo).# However, you may also find that many of these prebuilt binaries\\nare quite out of date and do not follow the same furious development cycle as Asterisk.\\nFinally, there do exist basic, precompiled Asterisk binaries that can be downloaded and\\ninstalled in whatever Linux distribution you have chosen. However, the use of precompiled binaries doesn\\'t really save much time, and we have found that compiling\\nAsterisk with each install is not a very cumbersome task. We believe that the best way\\nto install Asterisk is to compile from the source code, so we won\\'t discuss prebuilt\\nbinaries very much in this bookand besides, don\\'t you want to be l33t?* In the next\\nchapter, we\\'ll look at how to initially configure Asterisk and several kinds of channels.\\n\\nInstalling Additional Prompts\\nAdditional prompts are installed via the menuselect application in your Asterisk source\\ndirectory. There are three sets of audio packages: Core Sound, Extra Sound, and Music\\nOn Hold File. Each set of packages is broken down into different formats (and the Core\\nSound packages are available in multiple languages). Using the menuselect application,\\n\\n# Gentoo doesn\\'t actually use a precompiled binary, but rather pulls the source from a repository, and builds\\n\\nand installs the software using its own package management system. But the version you get is still dependant\\nupon the maintainers packaging it for you, when you could simply build it yourself!\\n* l33t is a funny way of saying \"elite,\" known as leetspeak (computer slang). Even more funny is a well-written,\\n\\nserious article by Microsoft about leetspeak at http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/\\nleetspeak.mspx.\\n\\n50 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cyou can select combinations of audio packages for use in your environment. Some of\\nthe formats available include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWAV\\nlaw\\nalaw\\nGSM\\n\\nAs of this writing, the Core Sound packages are available in the following languages:\\n English\\n Spanish\\n French\\nSelecting any sounds in menuselect will cause the system to download\\nthe files from the Digium FTP server upon install. The size of these files\\nranges anywhere from 2 MB to 27 MB, so be aware of this when installing offline, or on slow and expensive links.\\n\\nOther Useful Add-ons\\nThe asterisk-addons package contains code to allow the storage of Call Detail Records\\n(CDRs) to a MySQL database. There is also code that allows Asterisk to natively play\\nMP3s (which we don\\'t recommend unless you have a powerful system with very few\\nphones on it). Some folks may also be interested in the interpreter that allows you to\\nload Perl code into memory for the life of an Asterisk process (which can be very helpful\\nif you have a large number of AGI calls to the Perl interpreter). Programs are placed\\ninto asterisk-addons when there are licensing issues preventing them from being implemented directly into the Asterisk source code, or when they are not considred mature\\nenough to be integrated with Asterisk.\\nThe http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asterisk/g729/ directory contains the code and registration program for the proprietary G.729A codec . If you install the g729 sounds packages,\\nAsterisk will be able to communicate with devices that natively support the G.729A\\ncodec, but will not be able to transcode between other codecs and G.729A until a license\\nis obtained to use it.\\n\\nCommon Compiling Issues\\nThere are many common compiling issues that users often run into. Here are some of\\nthe more common problems, and how to resolve them.\\nCommon Compiling Issues | 51\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\nFirst, let\\'s take a look at some of the errors you may encounter when running the\\nconfigure script.\\n\\nconfigure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\\nIf you receive the following error while attempting to run the configure script, you must\\ninstall the gcc compiler and its dependencies:\\nconfigure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH\\n\\nThe following packages are required for gcc:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngcc\\ncpp\\nglibc-headers\\nglibc-devel\\nglibc-kernheaders\\n\\nThese can be installed manually, by copying the files off of your distribution disks, or\\nthrough the yum package manager, with the command yum install gcc.\\n\\nconfigure: error: C++ preprocessor \"/lib/cpp\" fails sanity check\\nThe following error will be displayed if no C++ preprocessor is found installed on the\\nsystem.

If you don\\'t have your Linux kernel sources\\ninstalled, retrieve the sources for your installed kernel, install them, and create a symbolic link against /usr/src/linux-2.4. The following is an example of a depmod error:\\ndepmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.22/kernel/drivers/block/\\nloop.o\\n\\nLoading Asterisk and Zaptel Quickly\\nIf you run make config in the Asterisk or Zaptel source directories, then the initialization\\nscripts used to control Asterisk or Zaptel will be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/. The scripts\\ncan be used to easily load and unload Asterisk and Zaptel. They will also run the\\n\\n54 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cchkconfig command for you so Asterisk and Zaptel will be started automatically upon\\n\\nsystem boot.

The zaptel module does not require any configuration if it\\'s being used only for the ztdummy module. If you plan on loading the\\nztdummy module as your timing source (and thus, you will not be running any PCI\\nhardware in your system), now is a good time to load both drivers.\\n\\nSystems Running udevd\\nIn the early days of Linux, the system\\'s /dev/ directory was populated with a list of\\ndevices with which the system could potentially interact. At the time, nearly 18,000\\ndevices were listed. That all changed when devfs was released, allowing dynamic creation of devices that are active within the system. Some of the recently released\\ndistributions have incorporated the udev daemon into their systems to dynamically\\npopulate /dev/ with device nodes.\\n\\nLoading Zaptel Modules Without Scripts | 55\\n\\x0cTo allow Zaptel and other device drivers to access the PCI hardware installed in your\\nsystem, you must add some rules. Using your favorite text editor, open up your\\nudevd rules file. On CentOS, for example, this file is located\\nat /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules. Add the following lines to the end of your rules file:\\n# Section for zaptel\\ndevice\\nKERNEL=\"zapctl\",\\nKERNEL=\"zaptimer\",\\nKERNEL=\"zapchannel\",\\nKERNEL=\"zappseudo\",\\n\\nNAME=\"zap/ctl\"\\nNAME=\"zap/timer\"\\nNAME=\"zap/channel\"\\nNAME=\"zap/pseudo\"\\nNAME=\"zap/%n\"\\n\\nSave the file and reboot your system for the settings to take effect.\\nYou may not have to actually edit anything in your system, as the Zaptel\\ninstallation script will try to install the rules for you; however, we have\\nleft this here as a reference for those systems that are not automatically\\nconfigured.\\n\\nLoading Zaptel\\nThe zaptel module must be loaded before any of the other modules are loaded and used.\\nNote that if you will be using the zaptel module with PCI hardware, you must configure /etc/zaptel.conf before you load it. (We will discuss how to configure zaptel.conf for\\nuse with hardware in Chapter 4.) If you are using zaptel only to access ztdummy, you\\ncan load it with the modprobe command, as follows:\\n# modprobe zaptel\\n\\nIf all goes well, you shouldn\\'t see any output. To verify that the zaptel module loaded\\nsuccessfully, use the lsmod command. You should be returned a line showing the\\nzaptel module and the amount of memory it is using, as in the following:\\n# lsmod | grep zaptel\\nzaptel\\n\\n\\nLoading ztdummy\\nThe ztdummy module is an interface to a device that provides timing, which in turn\\nallows Asterisk to provide timing to various applications and functions that require it.\\nUse the modprobe command to load the ztdummy module after zaptel has been loaded:\\n# modprobe ztdummy\\n\\nIf ztdummy loads successfully, no output will be displayed. To verify that ztdummy is\\nloaded and is being used by zaptel, use the lsmod command. The following output is\\nfrom a computer running the 2.6 kernel:\\n\\n56 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0c# lsmod | grep ztdummy\\nModule\\nztdummy\\nzaptel\\n\\nSize\\n\\nUsed by\\n\\nIf you happen to be running a 2.4 kernel-based computer, your output from lsmod will\\nshow that ztdummy is using the usb-uhci module:\\n# lsmod | grep ztdummy\\nModule\\nztdummy\\nzaptel\\nusb-uhci\\n\\nSize\\n\\nUsed by\\n\\nLoading libpri Without Script\\nThe libpri libraries do not need to be loaded like modules. Asterisk looks for libpri at\\ncompile time and configures itself to use the libraries if they are found.\\n\\nStarting Asterisk Without Scripts\\nAsterisk can be loaded in a variety of ways. The easiest way is to start Asterisk by running\\nthe binary file directly from the Linux command-line interface. If you are running a\\nsystem that uses the init.d scripts, you can easily start and restart Asterisk that way as\\nwell. However, the preferred way of starting Asterisk is via the safe_asterisk script.\\n\\nConsole Commands\\nThe Asterisk binary is, by default, located at /usr/sbin/asterisk. If you\\nrun /usr/sbin/asterisk, it will be loaded as a daemon. There are also a few switches you\\nshould be aware of that allow you to (re)connect to the Asterisk CLI, set the verbosity\\nof CLI output, and allow core dumps if Asterisk crashes (for debugging with gdb). To\\nexplore the full range of options, run Asterisk with the -h switch:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -h\\n\\nHere is a list of the most commonly used options:\\n-c\\n\\nConsole. This will start Asterisk as a user process (not as a server), and will connect\\nyou to the Asterisk CLI. This option is good when you are debugging your startup\\nparameters, but should not be used for a normal system (if Asterisk is already\\nrunning, this option will not work and will issue a complaint).\\n-v\\n\\nVerbosity. This is used to set the amount of output for CLI debugging. The more\\n\"v\"s, the more verbose.\\n\\nLoading libpri Without Script | 57\\n\\x0c-g\\n\\nCore dump. If Asterisk were to crash unexpectedly, this would cause a core file to\\nbe created for later tracing with gdb. You generally do not use this in production,\\nunless you are writing code for Asterisk and want to debug any resulting crashes.\\n-r\\n\\nRemote. This is used to reconnect remotely to an already running Asterisk process.\\n(The process is remote from the standpoint of the console connecting to it but is\\nactually a local process on the machine. This has nothing to do with connecting to\\na remote process over a network using a protocol such as IP, as this is not supported.) This is the most common option and it is what you would use to connect to\\nAsterisk on a system where it is running as a daemon/service that was started by\\ninit at boot time.\\n-x \"<CLI command>\"\\n\\nExecute. Using this command in combination with -r allows you to execute a CLI\\ncommand without having to connect to the CLI and type it manually. An example\\nwould be to send a restart, which you would do by typing asterisk -rx\\n\"reload\" from the command line.\\nLet\\'s look at some examples. If you want to start Asterisk as a user program (because\\nyou are tweaking your config and will be starting and stopping it several times), and\\nyou want a verbosity level of 3, use the following command:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -cvvv\\n\\nIf the Asterisk process is already running (for example, if you have installed Asterisk as\\npart of the init process of the system), use the reconnect switch, like so:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvr\\n\\nIf you want Asterisk to dump a core file after a crash, you can use the -g switch when\\nstarting Asterisk:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -g\\n\\nTo execute a command without connecting to the CLI and typing it (perhaps for use\\nwithin a script), you can use the -x switch in combination with the -r switch:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"restart now\"\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"database show\"\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -rx \"sip show peers\"\\n\\nIf you are experiencing crashes and would like to output to a debug file, use the following command:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvvc | tee /tmp/debug.log\\n\\nNote that you do not have to use the v switch if you do not want the system to provide\\ndetailed output of what is going on. On a busy system, you may not want to get any\\noutput, as it can interfere with whatever you are doing on the console.\\n\\n58 | Chapter 3: Installing Asterisk\\n\\x0cDirectories Used by Asterisk\\nAsterisk uses several directories on a Linux system to manage the various aspects of the\\nsystem, such as voicemail recordings, voice prompts, and configuration files. This section discusses the necessary directories, all of which are created during installation and\\nconfigured in the asterisk.conf file.\\n\\n/etc/asterisk/\\nThe /etc/asterisk/ directory contains the Asterisk configuration files. One file, however\\n--zaptel.conf--is located in the /etc/ directory. The Zaptel hardware was originally\\ndesigned by Jim Dixon of the Zapata Telephony Group as a way of bringing reasonable\\nand affordable computer telephony equipment to the world. Asterisk makes use of this\\nhardware, but any other software can also make use of the Zaptel hardware and drivers.\\nConsequently, the zaptel.conf configuration file is not directly located in\\nthe /etc/asterisk/ directory.\\n\\n/usr/lib/asterisk/modules/\\nThe /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/ directory contains all of the Asterisk loadable modules.\\nWithin this directory are the various applications, codecs, formats, and channels used\\nby Asterisk. By default, Asterisk loads all of these modules at startup. You can disable\\nany modules you are not using in the modules.conf file, but be aware that certain modules are required by Asterisk or are dependencies of other modules. Attempting to load\\nAsterisk without these modules will cause an error at startup.\\n\\n/var/lib/asterisk\\nThe /var/lib/asterisk/ directory contains the astdb file and a number of subdirectories.\\nThe astdb file contains the local Asterisk database information, which is somewhat like\\nthe Microsoft Windows Registry. The Asterisk database is a simple implementation\\nbased on v1 of the Berkeley database. The db.c file in the Asterisk source states that this\\nversion was chosen for the following reason: \"DB3 implementation is released under\\nan alternative license incompatible with the GPL. Thus, in order to keep Asterisk licensing simplistic, it was decided to use version 1 as it is released under the BSD\\nlicense.\"\\nThe subdirectories within /var/lib/asterisk/ include:\\nagi-bin/\\nThe agi-bin/ directory contains your custom scripts, which can interface with Asterisk via the various built-in AGI applications.

Most channels do not support the transmission of images,\\nso this directory is rarely used. However, if more devices that support and make\\nuse of graphical images are released, this directory will become more relevant.\\nkeys/\\nAsterisk can use a public/private key system to authenticate peers connecting to\\nyour box via an RSA digital signature. If you place a peer\\'s public key in your\\nkeys/ directory, that peer can be authenticated by channels supporting this method\\n(such as the IAX2 channels). The private key is never distributed to the public. The\\nreverse is also true: you can distribute your public key to your peers, allowing you\\nto be authenticated with the use of your private key. Both the public and private\\nkeys--ending in the .pub and .key file extensions, respectively--are stored in the\\nkeys/ directory.\\nWhen you configure Asterisk for Music on Hold, applications utilizing this feature\\nlook for their MP3 files in the mohmp3/ directory. Asterisk is a bit picky about how\\nthe MP3 files are formatted, so you should use constant bitrate (CBR) encoding\\nand strip the ID3 tags from your files.\\nsounds/\\nAll of the available voice prompts for Asterisk reside in the sounds/ directory. The\\ncontents of the basic prompts included with Asterisk are in the sounds.txt file located in your Asterisk source code directory. Contents of the additional prompts\\nare located in the sounds-extra.txt file in the directory to which you extracted the\\nasterisk-sounds package earlier in this chapter.\\n\\n/var/spool/asterisk/\\nThe Asterisk spool directory contains several subdirectories, including\\ndictate/, meetme/, monitor/, outgoing/, system/, tmp/, and voicemail/ (see Figure 3-4).\\nAsterisk monitors the outgoing directory for text files containing call request information. These files allow you to generate a call simply by moving the correctly structured\\nfile into the outgoing/ directory.\\nCall files being placed into the outgoing/ directory can contain useful information, such\\nas the Context, Extension, and Priority where the answered call should start, or simply\\nthe application and its arguments. You can also set variables and specify an account\\ncode for Call Detail Records.

In the following chapter, we will touch on\\nthe initial configuration of your system with regard to various communications channels, such as analog devices attached to FXS and FXO ports, SIP channels, and IAX2\\nendpoints.\\n\\nConclusion | 67\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nInitial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\nI don\\'t always know what I\\'m talking about,\\nbut I know I\\'m right.\\n--Muhammad Ali\\n\\nCompleting all the steps in Chapter 3 should have left you with a working Asterisk\\nsystem. If it did not, please take the time to go back and review the steps, consult the\\nwiki, engage the community, and get your system running.\\nUnfortunately, we cannot yet make any calls, because we have not yet created any\\nchannels. To get this plane to fly, we\\'re going to need some runways. While there are\\ndozens of different channel types, and dozens of different ways to configure each type\\nof channel, we just want to get some calls happening, so let\\'s try and keep things simple.\\nWe have decided to guide you through the configuration of four channels: a Foreign\\neXchange Office (FXO) channel, a Foreign eXchange Station (FXS) channel, a Session\\nInitiation Protocol (SIP) channel, and an Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX) channel.* We\\nselected these channel types because they are far and away the most popular channel\\ntypes in use in small Asterisk systems, and one of the goals of this book is to keep things\\nas simple as is reasonable. If we cover the basics of these channels, we will not have\\ndone an exhaustive survey of all channel types or topologies, but we will have created\\na base platform on which to develop your telecommunications system. Further scenarios and channel configuration details can be found in Appendix D.\\nOur first effort will be to explore the basic configuration of analog interfaces such as\\nFXS and FXO ports with the use of a Digium TDM11B (which is an analog card with\\none FXS port and one FXO port).\\n* Officially, the current version is IAX2, but since all support for IAX1 was dropped many years ago, whether\\n\\nyou say \"IAX\" or \"IAX2,\" you are talking about the same version.\\n This configuration used to be known as the Digium Dev-lite kit. For more information on FXS versus FXO,\\n\\nkeep reading. Put simply, this card will give us one port to connect to a traditional analog line from the phone\\ncompany (FXO), and one port to connect to an analog telephone (FXS), which is any type of phone that will\\nwork with a traditional home telephone circuit.\\n\\n\\x0cNext, we\\'ll tackle a few Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) interfaces: a local SIP and\\nIAX2 channel connected to a softphone or hardphone, along with connecting two Asterisk boxes via these two popular protocols.\\nFor SIP, we are going to cover Linksys, Polycom, Aastra, Grandstream, and Cisco sets.\\nIf we do not cover your phone model, we apologize, but what is important to realize is\\nthat while most of these devices have many different parameters that you can define,\\ngenerally only a few parameters need to be defined in order to get the device to work.\\nThat will be our goal, because we figure it\\'s a lot less frustrating to tweak a functioning\\ndevice than to get it perfectly set up on the first try. We won\\'t discuss all the features\\nyou may want your channel to have (such as caller ID or advanced codec and security\\nsettings), but you will be able to make and receive calls with your phone, which should\\nput a smile on your face--a good state to be in as we dig deeper into things.\\nOnce you\\'ve worked through this chapter, you will have a basic system consisting of\\nmany useful interfaces, which will provide the foundation we need to explore the\\nextensions.conf file (discussed in detail in Chapter 5), where the dialplan is stored\\n(technically, it contains the instructions Asterisk needs to build the dialplan). If you do\\nnot have access to the analog hardware, some of the examples will not be available to\\nyou, but you will still have configured a system suitable for a pure-VoIP environment.\\n\\nWhat Do I Really Need?\\nThe asterisk character (*) is used as a wildcard in many different applications. It is a\\ngood name for this PBX for many reasons, one of which is the enormous number of\\ninterface types to which Asterisk can connect. These include:\\n Analog interfaces, such as your telephone line and analog telephones\\n Digital circuits, such as T1 and E1 lines\\n VoIP protocols such as SIP and IAX\\nAsterisk doesn\\'t need any specialized hardware--not even a sound card--even though\\nit is common to expect a telephone system to physically connect to a voice network.\\nThere are many types of channel cards that allow you to connect your Asterisk to things\\nlike analog phones or PSTN circuits, but they are not essential to the functioning of\\nAsterisk. On the user (or station) side of the system, you can choose from all kinds of\\nsoftphones that are available for Windows, Linux, and other operating systems--or\\nuse almost any physical IP phone. That handles the telephone side of the system. On\\nthe carrier side, if you don\\'t connect directly to a circuit from your central office, you\\ncan still route your calls over the Internet using a VoIP service provider.\\n\\n ...and H.323 and SCCP and MGCP and UNISTIM\\n\\n70 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cWorking with Interface Configuration Files\\nIn this chapter, we\\'re going to build an Asterisk configuration on the platform we have\\njust installed. For the first few sections on FXO and FXS channels, we\\'ll assume that\\nyou have a Digium TDM11B kit (which comes with one FXO and one FXS interface).\\nThis will allow you to connect to an analog circuit (FXO) and to an analog telephone\\n(FXS). Note that this hardware interface isn\\'t necessary; if you want to build an IP-only\\nconfiguration, you can skip to the section on configuring SIP.\\nThe configuration we do in this chapter won\\'t be particularly useful on its own, but it\\nwill be a kernel to build on. We\\'re going to touch on the following files:\\nzaptel.conf\\nHere, we\\'ll do low-level configuration for the hardware interface. We\\'ll set up one\\nFXO channel and one FXS channel. This configures the driver for the Linux kernel.\\nzapata.conf\\nIn this file, we\\'ll configure Asterisk\\'s interface to the hardware. This file contains\\na slightly higher-level configuration of the hardware in the Asterisk user-level\\nprocess.\\nextensions.conf\\nThe dialplans we create will be extremely primitive, but they will prove that the\\nsystem is working.\\nsip.conf\\nThis is where we\\'ll configure the SIP protocol.\\niax.conf\\nThis is where we\\'ll configure incoming and outgoing IAX channels.\\nIn the following sections, you will be editing several configuration files. You\\'ll have to\\nreload these files for your changes to take effect. After you edit the zaptel.conf file, you\\nwill need to reload the configuration for the hardware with /sbin/ztcfg -vv (you may\\nomit the -vv if you don\\'t need verbose output). Changes made in zapata.conf will require\\na module reload from the Asterisk console; however, changing signaling methods requires a restart. You will need to perform an iax2 reload and a sip reload after editing\\nthe iax.conf and sip.conf files, respectively.\\nIn order to test the new devices we have defined, we must have a dialplan through which\\nwe can make connections. Even though we have not discussed the Asterisk dialplan\\n(that\\'s coming up in the next chapter), we want you to create a basic extensions.conf\\nfile so that we can test our work in this chapter.\\nMake a backup copy of the sample extensions.conf (try the bash command mv exten\\nsions.conf extensions.conf.sample), and then create a blank extensions.conf file (using\\nthe bash command touch extensions.conf), and insert the following lines:\\n\\nWorking with Interface Configuration Files | 71\\n\\x0c[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nIn the [general] section, we have set autofallthrough=yes, which tells\\nAsterisk to continue when an extension runs out of things to do. If you\\nset this to no, then Asterisk will sit and wait for input after all priorities\\nhave executed. This is most prevalent if the Background() application is\\nthe last application executed in an extension. If set to yes (which is now\\nthe default in 1.4), Asterisk will drop the call after Background() finishes\\nexecuting (at the end of the prompt(s) supplied to it). In order to force\\nAsterisk to wait for input after the Background() application finishes\\nplaying the voice prompts supplied to it, we use the WaitExten()\\napplication.\\nDo not be afraid if what we\\'ve just written doesn\\'t make a whole lot of\\nsense, as we haven\\'t explored the dialplan, applications, priorities, or\\nextensions yet (that is coming up in the next chapter). So for now, just\\nset autofallthrough=yes. It is safest to use the autofallthrough=yes\\ncommand as we don\\'t want Asterisk hanging around waiting for input\\nunless we explicitly tell it to do so.\\n\\nThere is nothing else for now, but we\\'ll be using this file as we go through this chapter\\nto build a test dialplan so we can ensure that all of our devices are working. Also, be\\nsure to run the dialplan reload command from the Asterisk CLI to update to the latest\\nchanges. Verify your changes by running the CLI command dialplan show:\\n*CLI> dialplan show\\n[ Context \\'phones\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\nInclude =>\\n\\'internal\\'\\n\\n[pbx_config]\\n\\n[ Context \\'internal\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'incoming_calls\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'default\\' created by \\'pbx_config\\' ]\\n[ Context \\'parkedcalls\\' created by \\'res_features\\' ]\\n-= 1 extension (1 priority) in 5 contexts. =-\\n\\n72 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\n[res_features]\\n\\x0cYou will see the parkedcalls context because it is an internal context to\\nAsterisk, specified in the features.conf file.\\n\\nSetting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls\\nNow let\\'s expand upon the test dialplan we started in the previous section, allowing\\nus to dial back into the softphone after we have configured it and to use a dialplan\\napplication called Echo() that will allow us to test bidirectional audio. We\\'ll learn more\\nabout dialplans in Chapter 5, so for now, just add the italicized bits to your existing\\nextensions.conf file. We\\'ll be making use of this dialplan throughout the chapter, and\\nexpanding on it in certain sections. Once you\\'ve entered the text into extensions.conf,\\nreload the dialplan by running dialplan reload from the Asterisk console:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nFXO and FXS Channels\\nThe difference between an FXO channel and an FXS channel is simply which end of\\nthe connection provides the dial tone. An FXO port does not generate a dial tone; it\\naccepts one. A common example is the dial tone provided by your phone company. An\\nFXS port provides both the dial tone and ringing voltage to alert the station user of an\\ninbound call. Both interfaces provide bidirectional communication (i.e., communication that is transmitted and received in both directions simultaneously).\\n\\n Bidirectional communication is also known as full duplex in some circles. Half duplex means communication\\n\\nis only traveling in one direction at a time.\\n\\nSetting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls | 73\\n\\x0cIf your Asterisk server has a compatible FXO port, you can plug a telephone line from\\nyour telephone company (or \"telco\") into this port. Asterisk can then use the telco line\\nto place and receive telephone calls. By the same token, if your Asterisk server has a\\ncompatible FXS port, you may plug an analog telephone into your Asterisk server, so\\nthat Asterisk may call the phone and you may place calls.\\nPorts are defined in the configuration by the signaling they use, as opposed to the\\nphysical type of port they are. For instance, a physical FXO port will be defined in the\\nconfiguration with FXS signaling, and an FXS port will be defined with FXO signaling.\\nThis can be confusing until you understand the reasons for it. FX_ cards are named not\\naccording to what they are, but rather according to what is connected to them. An\\nFXS card, therefore, is a card that connects to a station. Since that is so, you can see\\nthat in order to do its job, an FXS card must behave like a central office and use FXO\\nsignaling. Similarly, an FXO card connects to a central office (CO), which means it will\\nneed to behave like a station and use FXS signaling. The modem in your computer is\\na classic example of an FXO device.\\nThe older Digium X100P card used a Motorola chipset, and the X101P\\n(which Digium sold before completely switching to the TDM400P) is\\nbased on the Ambient/Intel MD3200 chipset. These cards are modems\\nwith drivers adapted to utilize the card as a single FXO device (the telephone interface cannot be used as an FXS port). Support for the X101P\\ncard has been dropped in favor of the TDM series of cards.\\nThese cards (or their clones) SHOULD NOT be used in production environments. They are $10 on eBay for a reason.\\nThe X100P/X101P cards are poor cards for production use due to their\\ntendency to introduce echo into your telephone calls, and their lack of\\nremote disconnect supervision. Do yourself a favor and don\\'t waste your\\ntime with this hardware. You will find that if you ask the community\\nfor support of these cards, many responses will be hostile. You have\\nbeen warned.\\n\\nDetermining the FXO and FXS Ports on Your TDM400P\\nFigure 4-1 contains a picture of a TDM400P with an FXS module and an FXO module.\\nYou can\\'t see the colors, but module 1 is a green FXS module, and module 2 is an\\norange-red FXO module. In the bottom-right corner of the picture is the Molex connector, where power is supplied from the computer\\'s power supply.\\nPlugging an FXS port (the green module) into the PSTN may destroy\\nthe module and the card due to voltage being introduced into a system\\nthat wants to produce voltage, not receive it!\\n\\n74 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-1. A TDM400P with an FXS module (1 across) and an FXO module (2 across)\\nBe sure to connect your computer\\'s power supply to the Molex connector on the TDM400P if you have FXS modules, as it is used to supply\\nthe voltage needed to drive the ring generator on the FXS ports. The\\nMolex connector is not required if you have only FXO modules.\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection\\nWe\\'ll start by configuring an FXO channel. First we\\'ll configure the Zaptel hardware,\\nand then the Zapata hardware. We\\'ll set up a very basic dialplan, and we\\'ll show you\\nhow to test the channel.\\n\\nZaptel Hardware Configuration\\nThe zaptel.conf file located in /etc/ is used to configure your hardware. The following\\nminimal configuration defines an FXO port with FXS signaling:\\nloadzone=us\\ndefaultzone=us\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection | 75\\n\\x0cIn the first line, in addition to indicating whether we are using FXO or FXS signaling,\\nwe specify one of the following protocols for channel 2:\\n Loop start (ls)\\n Ground start (gs)\\n Kewlstart (ks)\\nThe difference between loop start and ground start has to do with how the equipment\\nrequests a dial tone: a ground-start circuit signals the far end that it wants a dial tone\\nby momentarily grounding one of the leads; a loop-start circuit uses a short to request\\na dial tone. Though not common for new installations, analog ground start lines still\\nexist in many areas of the country. Ground start is really a rather strange thing, because\\nit doesn\\'t exist in its analog form in Asterisk, so technically, there is no ground signal\\nhappening, but is rather a signaling bit that is intended for analog circuitry that historically would have been at the end of the T1. If this does not make much sense, don\\'t\\nsweat it; chances are you won\\'t have to worry about ground-start signaling. All home\\nlines (and analog telephones/modems/faxes) in North America use loop-start signaling.\\nKewlstart is in fact the same as loop start, except that it has greater intelligence and is\\nthus better able to detect far-end disconnects.# Kewlstart is the preferred signaling\\nprotocol for analog circuits in Asterisk.\\nTo configure a signaling method other than kewlstart, replace the ks in fxsks with either\\nls or gs (for loop start or ground start, respectively).\\nloadzone configures the set of indications (as configured in zonedata.c) to use for the\\nchannel. The zonedata.c file contains information about all of the various sounds that\\na phone system makes in a particular country: dial tone, ringing cycles, busy tone, and\\nso on. When you apply a loaded tone zone to a Zap channel, that channel will mimic\\nthe indications for the specified country. Different indication sets can be configured for\\ndifferent channels. The defaultzone is used if no zone is specified for a channel.\\n\\nAfter configuring zaptel.conf, you can load the drivers for the card. modprobe is used to\\nload modules for use by the Linux kernel. For example, to load the wctdm driver, you\\nwould run:\\n# modprobe wctdm\\n\\nIf the drivers load without any output, they have loaded successfully.* You can verify\\nthat the hardware and ports were loaded and configured correctly with the use of the\\nztcfg program:\\n Yes, there is such a thing as ground-start signaling on channelized T1s, but that has nothing to do with an\\n\\nactual ground condition on the circuit (which is entirely digital).\\n# A far-end disconnect happens when the far end hangs up. In an unsupervised circuit, there is no method of\\n\\ntelling the near end that the call has ended. If you are on the phone this is no problem, since you will know\\nthe call has ended and will manually hang up your end. If, however, your voicemail system is recording a\\nmessage, it will have no way of knowing that the far end has terminated and will, thus, keep recording silence,\\nor even the dial tone or reorder tone. Kewlstart can detect these conditions and disconnect the circuit.\\n\\n76 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# /sbin/ztcfg -vv\\n\\nThe channels that are configured and the signaling method being used will be displayed.\\nFor example, a TDM400P with one FXO module has the following output:\\nZaptel Configuration\\n======================\\nChannel map:\\nChannel 02: FXS Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 02)\\n1 channels configured.\\n\\nIf you receive the following error, you have configured the channel for the wrong signaling method (or there is no hardware present at that address):\\nZT_CHANCONFIG failed on channel 2: Invalid argument (22)\\nDid you forget that FXS interfaces are configured with FXO signaling\\nand that FXO interfaces use FXS signaling?\\n\\nTo unload drivers from memory, use the rmmod (remove module) command, like so:\\n# rmmod wctdm\\n\\nThe zttool program is a diagnostic tool used to determine the state of your hardware.\\nAfter running it, you will be presented with a menu of all installed hardware.

The zapata.conf file also controls the various\\nfeatures and functionality associated with the hardware channels, such as Caller ID,\\ncall waiting, echo cancellation, and a myriad of other options.\\nWhen you configure zaptel.conf and load the modules, Asterisk is not aware of anything\\nyou\\'ve configured. The hardware doesn\\'t have to be used by Asterisk; it could very well\\nbe used by another piece of software that interfaces with the Zaptel modules. You tell\\nAsterisk about the hardware and control the associated features via zapata.conf:\\n[trunkgroups]\\n; define any trunk groups\\n[channels]\\n; hardware channels\\n\\n* It is generally safe to assume that the modules have loaded successfully, but to view the debugging output\\n\\nwhen loading the module, check the console output (by default this is located on TTY terminal 9, but this is\\nconfigurable in the safe_asterisk script--see the previous chapter for details).\\n\\nConfiguring an FXO Channel for a PSTN Connection | 77\\n\\x0c; default\\nusecallerid=yes\\nhidecallerid=no\\ncallwaiting=no\\nthreewaycalling=yes\\ntransfer=yes\\nechocancel=yes\\nechotraining=yes\\n; define channels\\ncontext=incoming\\nsignaling=fxs_ks\\nchannel => 2\\n\\n; Incoming calls go to [incoming] in extensions.conf\\n; Use FXS signaling for an FXO channel\\n; PSTN attached to port 2\\n\\nThe [trunkgroups] section is used for connections where multiple physical lines are\\nused as a single logical connection to the telephone network, and won\\'t be discussed\\nfurther in this book. If you require this type of functionality, see the\\nzapata.conf.sample file and your favorite search engine for more information.\\nThe [channels] section determines the signaling method for hardware channels and\\ntheir options. Once an option is defined, it is inherited down through the rest of the\\nfile. A channel is defined using channel =>, and each channel definition inherits all of\\nthe options defined above that line. If you wish to configure different options for different channels, remember that the options should be configured before the channel\\n=> definition.\\nWe\\'ve enabled Caller ID with usecallerid=yes and specified that it will not be hidden\\nfor outgoing calls with hidecallerid=no. Call waiting is deactivated on an FXO line\\nwith callwaiting=no. Enabling three-way calling with threewaycalling=yes allows an\\nactive call to be placed on hold with a hook switch flash (discussed in Chapter 7) to\\nsuspend the current call. You may then dial a third party and join them to the conversation with another hook switch. The default is to not enable three-way calling.\\nAllowing call transfer with a hook switch is accomplished by configuring trans\\nfer=yes; it requires that three-way calling be enabled. The Asterisk echo canceller is\\nused to remove the echo that can be created on analog lines. You can enable the echo\\ncanceller with echocancel=yes. The echo canceller in Asterisk requires some time to\\nlearn the echo, but you can speed this up by enabling echo training (echotrain\\ning=yes). This tells Asterisk to send a tone down the line at the start of a call to measure\\nthe echo, and therefore learn it more quickly.\\nWhen a call comes in on an FXO interface, you will want to perform some action. The\\naction to be performed is configured inside a block of instructions called a context.\\nIncoming calls on the FXO interface are directed to the incoming context with con\\ntext=incoming. The instructions to perform inside the context are defined within\\nextensions.conf.\\nFinally, since an FXO channel uses FXS signaling, we define it as such with signal\\ning=fxs_ks.\\n\\n78 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cDialplan Configuration\\nThe following minimal dialplan makes use of the Echo() application to verify that bidirectional communications for the channel are working:\\n[incoming]\\n; incoming calls from the FXO port are directed to this context\\n;from zapata.conf\\nexten => s,1,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Echo()\\n\\nWhatever you say, the Echo() application will relay back to you.\\n\\nDialing In\\nNow that the FXO channel is configured, let\\'s test it. Run the zttool application and\\nconnect your PSTN line to the FXO port on your TDM400P. Once you have a phone\\nline connected to your FXO port, you can watch the card come out of a RED alarm.\\nNow dial the PSTN number from another external phone (such as a cell phone). Asterisk will answer the call and execute the Echo() application. If you can hear your voice\\nbeing reflected back, you have successfully installed and configured your FXO channel.\\n\\nConfiguring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone\\nThe configuration of an FXS channel is similar to that of an FXO channel. Let\\'s take a\\nlook.\\n\\nZaptel Hardware Configuration\\nThe following is a minimal configuration for an FXS channel on a TDM400P. The\\nconfiguration is identical to the FXO channel configuration above, with the addition\\nof fxoks=1.\\nRecall from our earlier discussion that the opposite type of signaling is used for FXO\\nand FXS channels, so we will be configuring FXO signaling for our FXS channel. In the\\nexample below we are configuring channel 1 to use FXO signaling, with the kewlstart\\nsignaling protocol:\\nloadzone=us\\ndefaultzone=us\\n\\nAfter loading the drivers for your hardware, you can verify their state with the use\\nof /sbin/ztcfg -vv:\\n\\nConfiguring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone | 79\\n\\x0cZaptel Configuration\\n======================\\nChannel map:\\nChannel 01: FXO Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 01)\\nChannel 02: FXS Kewlstart (Default) (Slaves: 02)\\n2 channels configured.\\n\\nZapata Hardware Configuration\\nThe following configuration is identical to that for the FXO channel, with the addition\\nof a section for our FXS port and, of the line immediate=no. The context for our FXS\\nport is phones, the signaling is fxoks (kewlstart), and the channel number is set to 1.\\nFXS channels can be configured to perform one of two different actions when a phone\\nis taken off the hook. The most common (and often expected) option is for Asterisk to\\nproduce a dial tone and wait for input from the user. This action is configured with\\nimmediate=no. The alternative action is for Asterisk to automatically perform a set of\\ninstructions configured in the dialplan instead of producing a dial tone, which you\\nindicate by configuring immediate=yes. The instructions to be performed are found in\\nthe context configured for the channel and will match the s extension (both of these\\ntopics will be discussed further in the following chapter).\\nHere\\'s our new zapata.conf:\\n[trunkgroups]\\n; define any trunk groups\\n[channels]\\n; hardware channels\\n; default\\nusecallerid=yes\\nhidecallerid=no\\ncallwaiting=no\\nthreewaycalling=yes\\ntransfer=yes\\nechocancel=yes\\nechotraining=yes\\nimmediate=no\\n; define channels\\ncontext=phones\\nsignalling=fxo_ks\\nchannel => 1\\n\\n; Uses the [internal] context in extensions.conf\\n; Uses FXO signalling for an FXS channel\\n; Telephone attached to port 1\\n\\n Also referred to as the Batphone method, and more formally known as an Automatic Ringdown or Private\\n\\nLine Automatic Ringdown (PLAR) circuit. This method is commonly used at rental car counters and airports.\\n\\n80 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0ccontext=incoming\\nsignalling=fxs_ks\\nchannel => 2\\n\\n; Incoming calls go to [incoming] in extensions.conf\\n; Use FXS signalling for an FXO channel\\n; PSTN attached to port 2\\n\\nDialplan Configuration\\nWe will make use of our minimal dialplan we configured earlier in the chapter to test\\nour FXS port with the use of the Echo() application. The relevant section, which should\\nalready exist in your dialplan, looks like this:\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nWhatever you say, the Echo() application will relay back to you.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones\\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), commonly used in VoIP phones (either hard\\nphones, or softphones), takes care of the setup and teardown of calls, along with any\\nchanges during a call such as call transfers. The purpose of SIP is to help two endpoints\\ntalk to each other (if possible, directly to each other). The SIP protocol is simply a\\nsignaling protocol, which means that its purpose is only to get the two endpoints talking\\nto each other, and not to deal with the media of the call (your voice). Rather, your voice\\nis carried using another protocol called the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP; RFC\\n3550) to transfer media directly between the two endpoints.\\nWe use the term media to refer to the data transferred between endpoints\\nand used to reconstruct your voice at the other end. It may also refer to\\nmusic or prompts from the PBX.\\n\\nIn the world of SIP, we call our endpoints user agents, of which there are two types:\\nclient and server. The client is the endpoint that generates the request, and the server\\nprocesses the request and generates a response. When an endpoint wishes to place a\\ncall to another endpoint (such as our softphone calling another softphone), we generate\\nour request and send this to a SIP proxy. A proxy server will take the request, determine\\n RFC 3261 is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt. While the document is fairly large, we strongly\\n\\nencourage anyone who wishes to become an Asterisk professional to read at least the first 100 or so pages of\\nthis document and to understand how calls are set up, as this knowledge will be imperative when you\\'re\\nlooking at a SIP trace (sip debug from the Asterisk console) trying to determine why your calls are not getting\\nset up correctly.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 81\\n\\x0cwhere the request is destined for, and forward it on. Once the two user agents have\\nnegotiated a successful call setup, the media is transported via the RTP protocol and\\nsent directly between the two user agents. SIP proxies do not handle media; they simply\\ndeal with the SIP packets.\\nAsterisk, on the other hand, is called a Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA). This means\\nthat Asterisk acts like a user agent in either the server (receiving) or client (sending)\\nrole. So when our softphone dials an extension number, the call is set up between the\\nsoftphone and Asterisk directly. If the logic we\\'ve built into Asterisk determines that\\nyou mean to call another user agent, then Asterisk acts as a user agent client and sets\\nup another connection (known as a channel) to the other phone. The media between\\nthe two phones then flows directly through Asterisk. From the viewpoint of the\\nphones, they are talking with Asterisk directly.\\n\\nBasic SIP Telephone Configuration in Asterisk\\nConfiguring a SIP phone to work with Asterisk does not require much. However, because there are so many options possible in both Asterisk and the configuration of the\\nparticular telephone set or softphone, things can get confusing. Add to this the fact that\\nsimilar things can have different names, and you have a recipe for frustration. What we\\nare going to do, therefore, is give you the bare-bones basics. If you follow our advice,\\nyou should be able to get the sets we cover working (and be well on your way to getting\\na phone that we have not covered to work as well). We are not saying that this is the\\nbest way, or even the right way, but it is the simplest way, and from a working foundation, it is much easier to take a basic configuration and tweak things until you get\\nthe solution you need.\\nJust as we did with the extensions.conf file; run the following commands\\nin your bash shell:\\n# mv sip.conf sip.conf.sample\\n# touch sip.conf\\n\\nDefining the SIP device in Asterisk\\nIf you put the following in a sip.conf file, you will be able to register a phone to the\\nsystem.\\n[general]\\n\\n An excellent open source SIP proxy is OpenSER, available at http://www.openser.org.\\n Yes, there are ways to making the media flow directly between the phones once the call is set up. This is done\\n\\nin the sip.conf file using either directrtpsetup=yes (an experimental option allowing the media to be\\nredirected in the initial call setup) or canreinvite=yes (where media initially goes through Asterisk until a reINVITE happens, at which point the media can be sent directly between the phones).\\n\\n82 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0ctype=friend\\ncontext=phones\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nNot pretty, not secure, not flexible, not fully-featured, but this will work.\\nEven though we have named this SIP device 1000, and we are probably going to assign\\nit that extension number, you should note that we could have named it whatever we\\nwanted. Names such as mysipset, john, 0004f201ab0c are all valid, popular, and may\\nsuit your needs better.# What we are doing is assigning a unique identifier to a device,\\nwhich will form part of the credentials when a call is placed using the SIP channel.\\nSince we want to be able to both send calls to the softphone and allow the client to\\nplace calls, we have defined the type as friend. The other two types are user and\\npeer. From the viewpoint of Asterisk, a user is configured to enter the dialplan, and a\\npeer is created for calls leaving the dialplan (via the Dial() application). A friend is\\nsimply a shortcut that defines both a user and a peer. If in doubt, define the type as\\nfriend.\\nThe host option is used to define where the client exists on the network when Asterisk\\nneeds to send a call to it. This can either be defined statically by defining something\\nlike host=192.168.1.100, or if the client has a dynamic IP address, then we set\\nhost=dynamic. When the host option is set as dynamic, and the client is configured to\\nregister, Asterisk will receive a REGISTER packet from the endpoint (i.e., telephone\\nset or softphone), telling Asterisk which IP address the SIP peer is using.\\nIf you do not trust your network, you should probably also force the use of a password\\nby adding the following to the device definition. This is one of those things that is not\\ntechnically necessary, but is probably a good idea:\\nsecret=guessthis\\n\\nConfiguring the Device Itself\\nIn the configuration menus of the phone itself (which could be via a web GUI, through\\nmenus on the phone itself, or possibly using configuration files that are stored on a\\nserver), the unique identifier (which in this case is 1000) again forms part of the credentials for the authentication process. Naturally, for a connection to be successful,\\nthis has to match in both Asterisk and in the set itself. The fun begins when you realize\\nthat there is no set rule as to what this identifier is formally called. We have elected\\nsimply to call it the Unique Identifier.\\n\\n# The maximum length of a username is 255 characters.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 83\\n\\x0cIn the SIP RFC (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3261.html), section 19.1\\ncalls this user token, \"the identifier of a particular resource at the host\\nbeing addressed,\" verbiage consistent with our usage of [1000] as the\\nset identifier in the sip.conf file of Asterisk.\\n\\nInstead, you will want to look for fields that are labeled user name, auth name,\\nauthentication name, and so on. The thing to remember is that since you know that the\\nAsterisk end of the equation is configured simply and correctly, you can experiment\\nwith the phone setting until you find a combination that works. This is much better\\nthan the usual suffering that new users go through, as they change settings in both\\nplaces and have no luck getting a phone to register.\\nWe\\'re gonna say it again: configure sip.conf in the simplest manner possible, and then don\\'t change your Asterisk configuration. Trust us; what\\nwe have written here will work. Get your set working (i.e., where you\\ncan make and receive calls), and you will be in a far better position to\\nbegin experimenting with different settings. We have seen too much\\nsuffering (including our own), and we want it to end.\\n\\nSimplifying sip.conf\\nThe sip.conf file (which was copied to the /etc/asterisk directory by the make samples\\ncommand we ran in the previous chapter) contains a large number of options and\\ndocumentation inside it, but the file is actually very minimal if you remove all the\\ncommented parameters. The default file really breaks down to just the following few\\nlines being uncommented by default:\\n[general]\\ncontext=default\\nallowoverlap=no\\nsrvlookup=yes\\n\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nDefault context for incoming calls\\nDisable overlap dialing support. (Default is yes)\\nUDP Port to bind to (SIP standard port is 5060)\\nbindport is the local UDP port that Asterisk will\\nlisten on\\nIP address to bind to (0.0.0.0 binds to all)\\nEnable DNS SRV lookups on outbound calls\\nNote: Asterisk only uses the first host\\nin SRV records\\nDisabling DNS SRV lookups disables the\\nability to place SIP calls based on domain\\nnames to some other SIP users on the Internet\\n\\n[authentication]\\n\\nThe [general] section contains the options that will apply to all SIP clients and trunks.\\nSome settings elsewhere are set only in the [general] section, and others can be set in\\nthe [general] section as defaults for all conditionals unless overridden. These options\\nare listed under the two columns labeled [users] and [peers] below the\\n[authentication] header.\\n\\n84 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cGenerally, the commented-out options will show you the default setting Asterisk uses,\\nor will tell you the default option in the option\\'s description.\\nYou can also check the current state of the SIP channel in Asterisk with the sip show\\nsettings CLI command.\\n\\nIf you are running Asterisk and a softphone on the same system (i.e.,\\nrunning an X-Lite softphone and Asterisk on a laptop or desktop), then\\nyou will need to modify the SIP port that client listens on. It will need\\nto be changed from 5060 to 5061 (or some other unused port) so that\\nAsterisk and the softphone do not interfere with each other.\\n\\nEssential Server Components\\nBefore we get into how to define these files, there are a few things that need to be\\nconfigured on your server. Running the right services on your network will ensure\\nyour Polycom sets can autoconfigure from the moment you plug them in. There\\'s a\\nlittle work involved here, but we promise that the payoff is worth it. Once you\\'ve done\\nthis a few times, it only really takes a few minutes on each new system, and going\\nforward, it\\'ll save you a lot of mucking about with web interfaces. When you take your\\nnew Polycom phone out of the box, plug it into your network, watch it autoconfigure\\nitself, and then successfully register with your Asterisk machine, you will know the sort\\nof joy that only geeks can experience.*\\nIt\\'s not really that complicated. Where we think people get confused is in making sense\\nof the various ways this can be achieved, because there are a lot of choices.\\n\\nDHCP server\\nTypically, a DHCP server is used to configure basic IP parameters for a device (IP address, default gateway, and DNS), but the DHCP protocol can actually pass many other\\nparameters. In our case, we want it to pass some information to the sets that will tell\\nthem where to download their config files from. Here is a sample config from a Linux\\nDHCP server that will do what is required:\\nddns-update-style interim;\\nignore client-updates;\\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\\noption routers 192.168.1.1;\\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;\\noption ntp-servers pool.ntp.org;\\n\\n* Typically, it\\'s at 4 A.M. on the morning of a critical 8 A.M. meeting, after having worked all weekend. Red\\n\\nBull is probably the most popular drink of the Asterisk developers. Dr. Pepper would be a close second. Red\\nBull, anyone?\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 85\\n\\x0coption time-offset -18000;\\n}\\n\\nKeep in mind that this assumes that the only things on this network are devices that\\nbelong to the phone system (this setup will hand out an IP address to any device that\\nrequests it). If you have a more complex environment, you will need to configure the\\nDHCP daemon to handle the various devices it is serving. For example, you might want\\nto devise a scope that restricts IP addresses in your voice LAN to Polycom phones. Since\\nall Polycom IP desk phones have 00:04:f2 as their OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), you might choose to restrict scope based on that.\\nIn a Microsoft DHCP environment, the tftp-server-name is referred to\\nas Boot server host name. It is defined under option 66.\\n\\nThe DHCP protocol is far more flexible than is often realized, because in most environments it is not used for complex provisioning tasks. With a little care and attention,\\nyou can devise a DHCP environment that serves both your voice and data devices and\\ngreatly simplifies administrative workload when adding new devices.\\n\\nFTP server\\nFTP is currently our favoriteway to configure Polycom sets. We would recommend it\\nover TFTP for any set that allows for both. To install it on your CentOS system, the\\nfollowing command will install VSFTPD, the Very Secure FTP Daemon:\\n# yum -y install vsftpd\\n\\nThen, in order to lock things down, we need to prevent anonymous logins with a simple\\nchange to the vsftpd config file, /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:\\n# anonymous_enable=NO\\n\\nRestart the server with service vsftpd restart. To ensure that the daemon runs after\\nevery reboot, run chkconfig vsftpd on.\\nNow, we have to create a user account and group for the sets to use. In this case, we\\nwill create an account for the Polycom sets:\\n\\n FTP is preferred over TFTP due to the ability of a Polycom phone to see timestamps on FTP files. This allows\\n\\nthe phone to avoid redownloading configuration files and firmware updates that it already has--thus\\nshortening boot time.\\n\\n86 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# groupadd PlcmSpIp\\n# useradd PlcmSpIp -g PlcmSpIp -p PlcmSpIp\\n# passwd PlcmSpIp\\n\\nSet the password to PlcmSpIp (the default FTP password for Polycom sets). This can\\nbe changed, but will then require manual configuration from each set in order to advise\\nthem of their nonstandard credentials.\\nFor added security, let\\'s make sure the FTP server keeps that account in a chroot jail:\\n# echo PlcmSpIp >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list\\n\\nThat pretty much does it as far as preparing the operating system to provide the required\\nservices to the phones.\\nIn the next few sections we have provided instructions for various popular SIP telephones. Choose the section that applies best to the phone that you are planning to use\\n(whether a hard- or soft-phone). You will note that we have given all of these phones\\nthe exact same unique identifier. If you plan on installing more than one of them, you\\nwill need to ensure that they have unique names, and be sure to update your sip.conf\\nfile to include those device definitions.\\n\\nCounterPath\\'s X-Lite Softphone\\nCounterPath\\'s X-Lite softphone has become very popular with the Asterisk community. It is simple, functional, easy on the eyes, and--most importantly--free.\\nIn this section we will be configuring the X-Lite softphone to connect to Asterisk.\\nThe IP address of the phone is 192.168.1.250, and Asterisk is located at 192.168.1.100.\\nThe X-Lite is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can obtain a copy\\nof X-Lite from http://www.counterpath.com/index.php?menu=download.\\nNow let\\'s configure our softphone for connecting to our Asterisk box. To configure XLite, click on the Settings button, as circled in Figure 4-2.\\nSelect System Settings  SIP Proxy  [Default], which will display the default configuration for the softphone. Configure the screen as shown in Figure 4-3.\\nIf you have not already started Asterisk, then start it now (see Chapter 3 for help installing and starting Asterisk). If Asterisk is running in the background, you can\\nreconnect to the CLI by running the following command:\\n# asterisk -rvvv\\n\\n You can get into assigning complex and unguessable passwords for the phones to use, but unless you are\\n\\ngoing to input the passwords into each phone manually, you\\'ll have to pass them their FTP username and\\npassword from the DHCP server. Any device that can get on the voice network can get the same information\\nfrom the DHCP server. We\\'re not telling you to ignore security; just don\\'t assume that creating separate\\npasswords for each phone is going to improve security.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 87\\n\\x0cSettings button\\n\\nFigure 4-2.

From what we can tell, they\\nbase this on one of two reasons: 1) The Polycom web-based interface is horrible, or 2)\\nthe automatic provisioning process is painful and confusing.\\nWith respect to item 1, we agree. The web interface on the Polycom phones has got to\\nbe one of the most annoying web interfaces ever developed for an IP telephone. We\\ndon\\'t use it, and we don\\'t recommend it.\\nSo that leaves us with some sort of server-based configuration. Fortunately, in this\\nregard, the Polycom IP phones are superb--so much so that we can pretty much forgive\\nthe web interface. Set configurations are stored in files on a server, and each set navigates\\nto the server, downloads the configuration files that are relevant to it, and applies them\\nto itself.\\n\\nDHCP server\\nIf you cannot control your DHCP server, you may have to manually specify the FTP\\nserver information on the phone. This is done by rebooting the set, pressing the setup\\nbutton before the set begins the load process, and specifying the address of the FTP\\nserver in the small boot menu that these phones offer.\\n\\nProtocol to use for downloading\\nThe Polycom phones are able to download their configuration by one of three protocols: TFTP, HTTP, and FTP.\\nRight off the bat we are going to tell you to avoid TFTP. It is not secure, and the set\\ncannot use date information to determine which versions of various files are the most\\ncurrent. It works, but there are better ways, and we are not going to discuss it further.\\nPolycom phones can pull their config data using HTTP as well, but it has not proven\\nto be popular, and so we are going to move on.\\n\\n Actually, it does serve one useful purpose, which is to allow you to log on to a set via a browser and query\\n\\nits configuration.\\n\\n90 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cFTP is currently the preferred method of allowing Polycom phones to obtain their\\nconfiguration. It works well, is fairly easy to configure, and is well supported by the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nFTP\\nFTP is currently our favorite way to configure Polycom sets. To install it on your CentOS\\nsystem, the following command will install VSFTPD, the Very Secure FTP Daemon:\\n# yum -y install vsftpd\\n\\nThen, in order to lock things down, we need to prevent anonymous logins, with a simple\\nchange to the vsftpd config file, /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:\\n# anonymous_enable=NO\\n\\nRestart the server with service vsftpd restart. To ensure that the daemon runs after\\nevery reboot, run chkconfig vsftpd on.\\nNow, we have to create a user account and group for the Polycom sets to use:\\n# groupadd PlcmSpIp\\n# useradd PlcmSpIp -g PlcmSpIp -p PlcmSpIp\\n# passwd PlcmSpIp\\n\\nSet the password to PlcmSpIp (the default FTP password for Polycom sets). This can\\nbe changed, but will then require manual configuration from each set in order to advise\\nthem of their nonstandard credentials.\\nFor added security, let\\'s make sure the FTP server keeps that account in a chroot jail:\\n# echo PlcmSpIp >> /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list\\n\\nThat pretty much does it as far as preparing the operating system to provide the required\\nservices to the phones.\\n\\nThe Polycom configuration files\\nWhile there seem to be a lot of different files that are needed to make a Polycom set\\nwork, they are each fairly easy to understand.\\nThe bootROM. This can best be described as the BIOS and operating system of the phone.\\nPerhaps there is a more technical explanation, but why make things confusing? The\\nbootROM should not need to be updated regularly, but it is good to keep an eye on\\nthe current releases to see if a newer bootROM has features that will be of benefit in\\nyour environment. This file will be named bootrom.ld.\\n You can get into assigning complex and unguessable passwords for the phones to use, but unless you are\\n\\ngoing to input the passwords into each phone manually, you\\'ll have to pass them their FTP user name and\\npassword from the DHCP server. Any device that can get on the voice network can get the same information\\nfrom the DHCP server. We\\'re not telling you to ignore security, just don\\'t assume that creating separate\\npasswords for each phone is going to improve security.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 91\\n\\x0cThe application image. Since Polycom sets are capable of supporting other VoIP protocols\\n(MGCP is supported, for example), the protocol that this set will employ forms part of\\nthe application image that the phone will download and run. If the image on the set is\\nalready correct, this file is not actually needed on the FTP server; however, it is common\\nto have this file available to ensure that the most recent version of the protocol is available for the sets to download. You will sometimes receive phones that are not running\\nthe latest version, so having the most current image will ensure that all sets are up-todate.\\nThe sip.cfg file. There is normally only one version of this file on a system, but it can be\\nnamed anything you want, and there can be as many different versions of this file as\\nare needed. For example, if you had an office where there were two different languages\\nin use, some users might prefer French on their set, and others English. In that case,\\nyou\\'d create a french.sip.conf file and an english.sip.conf file to handle each case. Name\\nthis file as you see fit, but pick a name that makes sense so that future administrators\\nhave a chance to make sense of your design choices.\\nThe master config file for each phone. This file is very simple and small. It is named to match\\nthe MAC address of each phone (so each set will need its own copy of this file) and tells\\nthe set what other files it needs to download in order to configure itself. This is the first\\nconfig file each set will read. In this file will be a reference to the application image this\\nset will use (currently named sip.ld), as well as the names of the XML files that have the\\nparameters for this phone (the .cfg files). A master config file for a set might look something like this:\\n\\'<?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\\'\\n\\'<!-- Default Master SIP Configuration File-->\\'\\n\\'<!-- Edit and rename this file to <Ethernet-address>.cfg for each phone.-->\\'\\n\\'<!-- $Revision: 1.14 $ $Date: 2005/07/27 18:43:30 $ -->\\'\\n\\'<APPLICATION APP_FILE_PATH=\"sip.ld\"\\nMISC_FILES=\"\"\\nLOG_FILE_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\nOVERRIDES_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\nCONTACTS_DIRECTORY=\"\"\\n/>\\'\\n\\nNote the name of the application file that we want this set to use, and the config files\\nthat it will be trying to find and apply.\\nThe set-specific config file. We recommend giving the phone1.cfg files names that make\\nsense. For example, SET<xxx>.cfg (such as SET201.cfg) to match the extension number of the phone, or FLOOR4CUBE23.cfg, or maybe BOB_SMITHS_IP430_SET.cfg,\\nor whatever seems best to you. What\\'s the best way to name them? We\\'re going to\\nanswer that question by asking a question. Let\\'s say you have 100 of these phones.\\nWhen you list the contents of the /home/PlcmSpIp folder, how do you want the 100\\nconfig files for the sets to appear?\\n\\n92 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cGotchas. Settings that are configured directly on the telephone will be stored on the\\nfilesystem of the set, and may take precedence over parameters passed in config files.\\nIf you are having any problems applying changes to a set, try reformatting the phone.\\nThis will force the set to accept the parameters contained in the config files.\\n\\nCisco 7960 Telephone\\nThe venerable old C7960 is now a part of VoIP history. One of the first SIP telephones\\nthat could actually be taken seriously, the only real complaint one can have about this\\nphone is the price: they are the Cadillac of SIP phones (meaning that they have all the\\nbells and whistles but are tough to justify at the price, and are a little out of date\\nsometimes).\\nIf you can get one of these, you are getting an excellent SIP telephone. If you buy one\\nnew, be prepared to pay.\\nOne of the ways this phone is out of date is the lack of remote provisioning from anything other than TFTP. TFTP has lost favor with networking professionals due to the\\nlack of authentication and encryption, but since it is the only method of remotely provisioning the phone, we are going to have to use the tftp-server daemon. We can install\\ntftp-server with the following command:\\n# yum install -y tftp-server\\n\\nOnce installed, we need to enable the server by modifying the /etc/xinetd.d/tftp file. To\\nenable the TFTP server, change the disable=yes line to disable=no.\\nservice tftp\\n{\\nsocket_type\\nprotocol\\nwait\\nuser\\nserver\\nserver_args\\ndisable\\nper_source\\ncps\\nflags\\n}\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\ndgram\\nudp\\nyes\\nroot\\n/usr/sbin/in.tftpd\\n-s /tftpboot\\nno\\n\\nThen start the TFTP server by running:\\n# service xinetd restart\\n\\nWe can verify the server is running with the following command:\\n# chkconfig --list | grep tftp\\ntftp:\\non\\n\\nAs long as tftp: on was returned, the server is up and running.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 93\\n\\x0cCisco phones by default are loaded with their own communication protocol known as SCCP (or Skinny). We will be showing you how to\\nconfigure the phone, but due to the proprietary nature of Cisco and its\\nphones, you will need to obtain the SIP firmware from your distributor.\\nAlso, there are both chan_sccp and chan_skinny modules for Asterisk,\\nbut they are beyond the scope of this book.\\n\\nWe will be registering our Cisco phone to the SIP friend we configured in \"Zaptel\\nHardware Configuration.\" The following configuration file should be saved into a file\\ntaking the format of SIP<mac>.cnf, where <mac> represents the MAC address of the\\ntelephone device you are configuring. Place this file into the /tftpboot/ directory on your\\nserver:\\n# Line 1 Configuration\\nline1_shortname: \"Jimmy Carter\"\\n# The phone label, displayed in the upper-righthand corner of the phone\\nphone_label: \"aristotle\" ; Has no effect on SIP messaging\\n# Phone password used for console or telnet access, limited to 31 characters\\nphone_password: \"cisco\"\\n\\nThen configure the address to register in the SIPDefault.cnf file, also placed in\\nthe /tftpboot/ directory of your server. proxy1_address will contain the IP address of\\nyour Asterisk server of where the phone should register for line 1. The image_version\\ncontains the version of the .loads and .sb2 files the phone will load into memory.\\n\\nWe need one additional file called OS79XX.TXT. This file contains only a single\\nlinethe .bin and .sbn file version to load into memory:\\n\\nIn order for our Cisco 7960 to use these files, we need to tell the phone where to pull\\nits configuration from. If using the DHCP server from your Linux server, you can modify\\nthe /etc/dhcpd.conf file in order to tell the phone where to pull its configuration from\\nby adding the line:\\noption tftp-server-name \"192.168.1.100\";\\n\\nwhich contains the IP address of the server hosting the TFTP server (assuming of course\\nthe TFTP server is configured at that address. This is the address we\\'ve been using for\\nour Asterisk server, and we again assume you\\'ve installed the TFTP server on the same\\nbox as Asterisk). See \"DHCP server\" for more information about configuring the DHCP\\nserver:\\n94 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cddns-update-style interim;\\nignore client-updates;\\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\\noption routers 192.168.1.1;\\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;\\noption tftp-server-name \"192.168.1.100\";\\noption ntp-servers pool.ntp.org;\\noption time-offset -18000;\\n}\\n\\nAlternatively, you can configure from the phone itself to manually use\\nan alternative TFTP server than that given by the DHCP server. To do\\nso, press the settings button, (on the G version of the Cisco phones, this\\nlooks like a square with a check mark inside of it; G means Global). You\\nwill then need to unlock the settings by pressing the 9 key. The default\\npassword is cisco. Once the phone is unlocked, press the 3 key on the\\ndialpad to enter the Network Configuration. Scroll down to option 32\\nand set the Alternate TFTP to YES. Then scroll up to option 7 and enter\\nthe IP address of the TFTP server you wish to boot from. Accept the\\nsettings and back out of the menu until the phone reboots itself. You\\ncan also use the *-6-settings three finger salute to reboot your phone at\\nany time.\\n\\nYou can watch the phone pull its configuration from the TFTP server by using tshark\\n(yum install ethereal). Filter on port 69 using the following command:\\n# tshark port 69\\n\\nYou should then be able to watch the network traffic from the phone requesting data\\nfrom your TFTP server.\\nIf all goes well, then you should see your phone registered to Asterisk!\\n\\nEver since they purchased Sipura Technologies, Linksys has been producing a line of\\neconomical VoIP telephones and ATAs (Analog Terminal Adaptors). Linksys has been\\nstealing a lot of business from Cisco. If you have read Clayton M. Christensen\\'s\\nThe Innovator\\'s Dilemma (HarperCollins), it becomes easier to understand Cisco\\'s\\nstrategy with respect to Linksys.\\nLinksys (and Sipura) products are well regarded for their excellent quality, especially\\nrelative to their price, but they are also famous for being painfully difficult to configure.\\n\\nConfiguring SIP Telephones | 95\\n\\x0c\\nThis is mostly because their configuration GUI offers hundreds of configurable parameters.\\nWe don\\'t care about that. Here\\'s what you need to know to get an SPA-942 working\\nwith your Asterisk system (and, we hope, most other Linksys VoIP devices as well).\\n\\nLogging in to the phone\\nThe first thing you need to do is get the IP address of the phone so you can log in to\\nthe GUI interface. From the phone itself, select the icon that looks like a piece of paper\\nwith a dog-eared corner (right below the envelope icon). This is the Settings button,\\nand is shown in Figure 4-4.\\nTo get the IP address of the phone, press the Settings button, followed by 9 (or use\\ndirectional pad and scroll down to Network). Then press the select button (there is a\\nrow of 4 buttons under the LCD screen--select is the leftmost button). The second field\\nshould show you the IP address of the phone.\\nNow open your browser, enter the IP address into the address bar, hit Enter, and you\\nwill be at the Info screen of the phone.\\n\\nRegistering your phone to Asterisk\\nSelect the Admin Login link in the upper-right corner of the screen. Once you\\'ve done\\nthis, you will be given several new tabs, such as Regional, Phone, Ext 1, Ext 2, and User.\\nSelect the Ext 1 tab which will set up our first line. Then make the following menu\\nselections:\\n1. General  Line Enable  yes\\n2. NAT Settings  NAT Mapping Enable  no\\n3. NAT Settings  NAT Keep Alive Enable  no\\n96 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c4. Proxy and Registration  Proxy  enter the IP address of Asterisk\\n5.

You\\'ll know this because the first lighted line button beside the LCD screen will change from orange to\\ngreen.\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan for Testing\\nIn order to allow our phone to call other phones (or, if a multiline phone, to call itself),\\nwe need to modify the extensions.conf file. Building on what we had in \"Setting Up the\\nDialplan for Some Test Calls,\" add the following parts to the [internal] context:\\nexten => 1000,n,Dial(SIP/1000,30)\\nexten => 1000,n,Hangup()\\n\\nIf you have two phones, or multiple lines configured, you can duplicate the previous\\nconfiguration and change the 1000 to the other extension name.\\n\\nConnecting to a SIP Service Provider\\nWith the advent of Internet telephony, there has been an influx of Internet-based phone\\ncompanies springing up all over the world! This gives you a large number of choices\\nfrom which to choose. Many of these service providers allow you to connect your Asterisk-based system to their networks,# and some of them are even running Asterisk\\nthemselves!\\n\\nConnecting to a SIP Service Provider | 97\\n\\x0cThe following configuration should get you connected with an Internet Telephony\\nService Provider (ITSP),* although it is impossible to know the unique configurations\\neach service provider will require from you, and ideally the provider will give you the\\nconfiguration required to connect your system with its own. However, not all are going\\nto support Asterisk, so we\\'re going to provide you with a generic configuration which\\nshould help you get on your way and, ideally, going in a matter of minutes:\\n[my_service_provider]\\ntype=peer\\nfromuser=my_unique_id\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 5060 for SIP signaling, and ports 10,000 through\\n20,000 for the RTP traffic. You can also narrow the range of RTP ports in the rtp.conf\\nfile located in /etc/asterisk. An excellent book on iptables firewalls is Linux Firewalls by\\nSteve Suehring and Robert Ziegler (Novell Press).\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 5060 -j ACCEPT\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 10000:20000 -j ACCEPT\\n# service iptables save\\n\\nBe aware that this will allow all UDP traffic from any source access to ports 5060 and\\n10,000 through 20,000.\\n\\nMost of the previous configuration may be familiar to you by now, but in case it\\'s not,\\nhere is a brief rundown.\\nBy defining the type as a peer, we are telling Asterisk not to match on the [my_serv\\nice_provider] name, but rather to match on the IP address in the INVITE message\\n(when the provider is sending us a call). The host parameter is the IP address that we\\'ll\\nplace our calls to, and the IP address we\\'ll be matching on when receiving a call from\\nthe provider.\\n# Be sure to check the policy of any service provider you are looking to connect with, as some of them may not\\n\\nallow you to use a PBX system with its service.\\n* Also known as a VoIP Service Provider (VSP).\\n\\n98 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cMatching on Username Instead of IP Address\\nSome service providers may insteadSession Initiation Protocol be sending their calls to\\nyou via multiple IP addresses, requiring you to create a separate peer account for each\\nIP address. If you don\\'t know each of these IP addresses, you may need to match on\\nthe username instead. The format for the service provider definition needs to only\\nchange slightly, but the biggest change to note is that you will need to set the [service_provider_header] as the username your service provider is going to send the call\\nto. We have also changed the type from a peer to a friend, which from the viewpoint\\nof Asterisk creates both a type user and type peer, where the type user will be matched\\nbefore the peer:\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=friend\\nfromuser=my_unique_id\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nNote that we\\'ve removed the deny and permit parameters since we may not know the\\nIP addresses the calls will be coming from. If you do happen to know them and still\\nwish to match them, you can add back in the deny and permit(s) for the IP addresses.\\n\\nThe fromuser parameter is going to affect the way our INVITE message is structured\\nwhen sending the call to the provider. By setting our username in the fromuser parameter, we will modify the From: and Contact: fields of the INVITE when sending a call\\nto the provider. This may be required by the provider if it\\'s using these fields as part of\\nits authentication routine. You can see the places Asterisk modifies the header in the\\nnext two code blocks.\\nWithout the fromuser:\\nAudio is at 66.135.99.122 port 18154\\nAdding codec 0x2 (gsm) to SDP\\nAdding codec 0x4 (ulaw) to SDP\\nAdding non-codec 0x1 (telephone-event) to SDP\\nReliably Transmitting (no NAT) to 10.251.55.100:5060:\\nFrom: \"asterisk\" <sip:asterisk@66.135.99.122>;tag=as4975f3ff\\nCSeq: 102 INVITE\\nUser-Agent: Asterisk PBX\\n\\nConnecting to a SIP Service Provider | 99\\n\\x0cAllow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY\\nSupported: replaces\\nContent-Type: application/sdp\\n\\nWith the fromuser:\\nAudio is at 66.135.99.122 port 11700\\nAdding codec 0x2 (gsm) to SDP\\nAdding codec 0x4 (ulaw) to SDP\\nAdding non-codec 0x1 (telephone-event) to SDP\\nReliably Transmitting (no NAT) to 10.251.55.100:5060:\\nFrom: \"asterisk\" <sip:my_unique_id@66.135.99.122>;tag=as3186c1ba\\nCSeq: 102 INVITE\\nUser-Agent: Asterisk PBX\\nAllow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY\\nSupported: replaces\\nContent-Type: application/sdp\\n\\nThe deny and permit statements are used to deny all incoming calls to this peer except\\nthe IP address defined by the permit parameter. This is simply a security measure used\\nto make sure nothing else matches on this peer except traffic coming from the IP address\\nwe expect.\\nAt the end is insecure=invite, which may be required for your provider. This is because\\nthe source of the INVITE may originate from its backend platform, but could be directed through its SIP proxy server. Basically what this means is that the IP address that\\nthe peer is coming from, and which you are matching on, may not be the IP address\\nthat is in the Contact line: field of the INVITE message when you are accepting a call\\nfrom your provider. This tells Asterisk to ignore this inconsistency and to accept the\\nINVITE anyway.\\nYou may need to set invite=invite,port if the port address is also inconsistent with what Asterisk is expecting.\\n\\nNow we need one additional parameter set in the [general] section of our sip.conf file:\\nregister. register is going to tell the service provider where to send calls when it has\\na call to deliver to us. This is Asterisk\\'s way of saying to the service provider, \"Hey! If\\nyou\\'ve got a call for me, send it to me at IP address 10.251.55.100.\" The register\\nparameter takes the following form:\\n\\n100 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cregister => username:secret@my.service_provider.tld\\n\\nNow we just need to configure a simple dialplan to handle our incoming calls and to\\nsend calls via the service provider. We\\'re going to modify the simple dialplan we started\\nbuilding in the \"Setting Up the Dialplan for Some Test Calls\" section of this chapter.\\nThe italicized sections are the new parts that we\\'re adding to the dialplan, with everything else existing previously.\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\nexten => _X.,1.NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Dial(SIP/1000)\\n[outgoing_calls]\\nexten => _X.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Dial(SIP/my_service_provider/${EXTEN})\\n[internal]\\nexten => 1000,n,Dial(SIP/1000,30)\\nexten => 1000,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => outgoing_calls\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP\\nThere may come a time when you have a pair of Asterisk boxes, and you\\'d like to pass\\ncalls between them. Luckily this isn\\'t very difficult, although it does have some oddities\\nthat we need to deal with, but from the configuration viewpoint it isn\\'t really all that\\ndifficult.\\n\\n We also assume you have configured at least one SIP extension from the previous section.\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 101\\n\\x0cToronto\\n\\nOsaka\\n\\nFigure 4-5. SIP trunking topology\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 5060 for SIP signaling, and ports 10,000 through\\n20,000 for the RTP traffic. You can also narrow the range of RTP ports in the rtp.conf\\nfile located in /etc/asterisk.

At the end of this section,\\nyou will be able to set up a call from Alice to Bob (and vice versa) through your pair of\\nAsterisk boxes (see Figure 4-5). This is a common scenario when you have two physical\\nlocations, such as a company with multiple offices that wants a single logical extension\\ntopology.\\nFirst, let\\'s configure our Asterisk boxes.\\n\\nConfiguring Our Asterisk Boxes\\nWe have a pair of Asterisk boxes that we\\'re going to call Toronto and Osaka and that\\nwe\\'re going to have register to each other. We\\'re going to use the most basic sip.conf\\nfile that will work in this scenario. Just like the SIP phone configuration earlier in this\\nchapter, it\\'s not necessarily the best way to do it, but it\\'ll work.\\nHere is the configuration for the Toronto box:\\n[general]\\nregister => toronto:welcome@192.168.1.101/osaka\\n[osaka]\\n\\n102 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0ctype=friend\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=osaka_incoming\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nAnd the configuration for the Osaka box:\\n[general]\\nregister => osaka:welcome@192.168.2.202/toronto\\n[toronto]\\ntype=friend\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=toronto_incoming\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nMany of the previous options may be familiar to you by now, but let\\'s take a look at\\nthem further just in case they are not.\\nThe second line of the file tells our Asterisk box to register to the other box, with the\\npurpose of telling the remote Asterisk box where to send calls when it wishes to send\\na call to our local Asterisk box. Remember how we mentioned a little oddity in the\\nconfiguration? Notice that at the end of the registration line we tag on a forward slash\\nand the username of the remote Asterisk box? What this does is tell the remote Asterisk\\nbox what digest name to use when it wants to set up a call. If you forget to add this,\\nthen when the far end tries to send you a call, you\\'ll see the following at your Asterisk\\nCLI:\\nhave <toronto>, digest has <s>\\n\\nSo by adding the forward slash and username, we tell the other end what to place in\\nthe Digest username of the Proxy Authorization field in the SIP INVITE message.\\nThe rest of the file is the authorization block we use to control the incoming and outgoing calls from the other Asterisk box. On the Toronto box, we have the [osaka]\\nauthorization block, and on the Osaka box, we have the [toronto] block. We define\\nthe type as a friend, which allows us to both receive and place calls from the other\\nAsterisk box. The secret is the password the other system should use when authenticating. The context is where incoming calls are processed in the dialplan\\n(extensions.conf). We set the host parameter to dynamic, which tells our Asterisk box\\nthat the other endpoint will register to us, thereby telling us what IP address to set up\\ncalls when we want to send a call to the other end. Finally, the disallow and allow\\nparameters control the codecs we wish to use with the other end.\\nIf you save the file and reload the SIP channel on both Asterisk boxes (sip reload from\\nthe Asterisk console), you should see something like the following, which will tell you\\nthe remote box successfully registered:\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 103\\n\\x0c*CLI>\\n\\n-- Saved useragent \"Asterisk PBX\" for peer toronto\\n\\nYou should see the status of the Host change from (Unspecified) to the IP address of\\nthe remote box when you run sip show peers:\\n*CLI> sip show peers\\nName/username\\nHost\\ntoronto/osaka\\n\\nDyn Nat ACL Port\\nD\\n\\nStatus\\nUnmonitored\\n\\nYou can verify that your own registration was successful by running sip show\\nregistry from the Asterisk console:\\n*CLI> sip show registry\\nHost\\nUsername\\nosaka\\n\\nRefresh State\\n\\nReg.Time\\n\\nNow that our Asterisk boxes are happy with each other, let\\'s configure a couple of SIP\\nphones so we can call between the boxes.\\n\\nSIP Phone Configuration\\nSee the \"Configuring an FXS Channel for an Analog Telephone\" section of this chapter\\nfor more information about configuring SIP phones with Asterisk. Below is the configuration for two SIP phones in the sip.conf file for each server, which we\\'ll be\\nreferencing from the dialplan in the next section, thereby giving us two endpoints to\\ncall between. Append this configuration to the end of the sip.conf file on each respective\\nserver.\\nToronto sip.conf:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nOsaka sip.conf:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nYou should now have extension 1000 registered to Toronto, and extension 1001 registered to Osaka. You can verify this with the sip show peers command from the\\nAsterisk console. Next, we\\'re going to configure the dialplan logic that will allow us to\\ncall between the extensions.\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan\\nNow we can configure a simple dialplan for each server allowing us to call between the\\ntwo phones we have registered: one to Toronto, the other to Osaka. In the \"Working\\nwith Interface Configuration Files\" section of this chapter, we asked you to create a\\n104 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0csimple extensions.conf file. We are going to build up a dialplan based on this simple\\nconfiguration. The dialplan for each server will be very similar to the other one, but for\\nclarity we will show both. The new lines we\\'re adding to the file will be italicized.\\nToronto extensions.conf:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(SIP/osaka/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[osaka_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nOsaka extensions.conf:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP | 105\\n\\x0cexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(SIP/toronto/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[toronto_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve configured your extensions.conf file, you can reload it from the Asterisk\\nconsole with the dialplan reload command. Verify your dialplan loaded with the\\ndialplan show command.\\nAnd that\\'s it! You should be able to place calls between your two Asterisk servers now.\\n\\nConfiguring an IAX Softphone\\nA major advantage of using the IAX2 protocol is that it is designed to be more friendly\\nto working within odd network configurations, especially working behind NAT. This\\nmakes it a fantastic protocol for softphone clients since they are often utilized on laptops\\nthat roam into many different networks, often with no control of the network itself\\n(such as when traveling between hotel networks).\\nThe Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX) protocol is usually used for server-to-server communication; more hard phones are available that talk SIP. However, there are several\\nsoftphones that support the IAX protocol, and work is progressing on several fronts\\nfor hard phone support in firmware. The primary difference between the IAX and SIP\\nprotocols is the way media (your voice) is passed between endpoints.\\nWith SIP, the RTP (media) traffic is passed using different ports than those used by the\\nsignaling methods. For example, Asterisk receives the signaling of SIP on port 5060 and\\nthe RTP (media) traffic on ports 10,000 through 20,000 by default. The IAX protocol\\ndiffers in that both the signaling and media traffic are passed via a single port: 4569.\\nAn advantage to this approach is that the IAX protocol tends to be better suited to\\ntopologies involving NAT.\\nThere exist many IAX-based softphones, but not so many hardware based phones. The\\nmost pronounced reason is because IAX2 is not yet an IETF standard, yet many people\\nhave become early adopters and have reaped the benefits.\\nAn excellent IAX2 softphone is idefisk, available at http://www.asteriskguru.com for\\nfree download. The authors have had excellent results with this softphone, and since\\nit runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, it is an excellent cross-platform\\nsoftphone to write about. We will be demonstrating version 1.31 in this book, although\\nversion 2.0 was recently released (April 2007) but is not yet available for Linux.\\n\\n The Asterisk Guru site is also an excellent source of documentation!\\n\\n106 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cConfiguring the Channel Configuration File (iax.conf)\\nLike the rest of this chapter, we\\'re attempting to get you up and running quickly with\\nthe smallest configuration file set possible in order to minimize the problems you may\\nhave in configuring your devices. Just like the sip.conf file, iax.conf requires only a few\\nsimple lines to get our IAX phone registered to Asterisk. Let\\'s take a look:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nYes, really, that\\'s all you need to get your softphone up and running. It\\'s not the most\\nsecure or feature-rich configuration (we\\'re not even using a password), but this will\\nwork.\\nIn the [general] section of our iax.conf file, we have a single option: autokill= yes. We\\nuse this option to avoid things from stalling when a peer does not ACK (reply) to our\\nNEW packet (new call setup request) within 2000 milliseconds. Instead of the reply to\\nvalue yes, you can set this to the number of milliseconds to wait for the ACK to our\\nNEW packet. You can control the autokill option for each individual peer by defining\\nqualify for those peers that you know may be on poor network connections.\\nThe rest of the file contains the definition for our softphone. We define the type as\\nfriend, which tells Asterisk we will send calls to this device and also accept calls from\\nthis device. A friend is a shortcut for defining a separate peer (send calls to the softphone), and user (accept calls from the softphone). We could also have defined\\nindividual definitions for the peer and user like so:\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=phones\\n[idefisk]\\ntype=peer\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve configured your iax.conf file, save the file and reload the IAX2 channel\\nmodule from your Asterisk console with module reload chan_iax2.so. Confirm your\\nnew peer exists by running iax2 show peers.\\nlocalhost*CLI> iax2 show peers\\nName/Username\\nHost\\nMask\\nidefisk\\n(Unspecified)\\n\\nPort\\n\\nStatus\\nUnmonitored\\n\\nConfiguring an IAX Softphone | 107\\n\\x0cFigure 4-6. idefisk\\n\\nFigure 4-7. idefisk Account Options screen\\n\\nConfigure the Softphone\\nOnce you\\'ve installed the idefisk softphone, open up the client and you\\'ll see the main\\nscreen shown in Figure 4-6.\\nAfter we\\'ve started the softphone, we need to configure our softphone so we can place\\ncalls. We also need to register to Asterisk so we can receive calls. To do this, Right-click\\non the icon in the top-left corner of the screen, which will open a drop-down menu.\\nSelect Account Options from the drop-down, which will bring up the screen shown in\\nFigure 4-7.\\n\\n108 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cStart by creating a new account on the softphone by clicking the New button and filling\\nout the relevant information. The Host should point to the IP address or domain name\\nof your Asterisk system, with the username matching that of the value located between\\nthe square brackets [ ] in your iax.conf file. Leave the password field blank, as we did\\nnot configure a secret in iax.conf, and the Caller ID and Number can be set to whatever\\nyou wish. If you want idefisk to register this account on startup, select the \"Register on\\nstartup\" checkbox. When done, click the OK button to save the new account.\\nIf you clicked the \"Register on startup checkbox,\" then the phone will attempt to register to Asterisk. On the Asterisk console you will see output telling you that the phone\\nhas registered:\\n-- Registered IAX2 \\'idefisk\\' (UNAUTHENTICATED) at 127.0.0.1:32771\\n\\nYou can verify your registration with the iax2 show peers command at the Asterisk\\nconsole:\\nlocalhost*CLI> iax2 show peers\\nName/Username\\nHost\\nMask\\nidefisk\\n\\nPort\\n\\nStatus\\nUnmonitored\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan for Testing\\nOne final thing to do is confirm dialing through our phone by configuring a simple\\ndialplan in extensions.conf. You can simply test that you have audio in both directions\\nby calling extension 500, or you can modify the dialplan we created in the \"Setting Up\\nthe Dialplan for Some Test Calls\" section of this chapter to place some test calls. If you\\nalso configured a SIP phone at extension 1000 in the previous sections, then the following will not overlap with that, as we\\'ll be using extension 1001 (unless you\\nconfigured multiple SIP extensions, in which case just configure a unique extension\\nnumber for your IAX2 softphone):\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\n[default]\\nexten => s,1,Verbose(1|Unrouted call handler)\\nexten => s,n,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Wait(1)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(tt-weasels)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[internal]\\nexten => 500,1,Verbose(1|Echo test application)\\nexten => 500,n,Echo()\\nexten => 500,n,Hangup()\\n\\nConfiguring an IAX Softphone | 109\\n\\x0cexten => 1001,n,Dial(IAX2/idefisk,30)\\nexten => 1001,n,Hangup()\\n[phones]\\ninclude => phones\\n\\nConnecting to an IAX Service Provider\\nSome Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSPs) provide the ability to originate and\\nterminate calls via the IAX2 protocol. Beyond minimizing the number of ports required\\nto be open on the firewall (IAX2 only requires a single port for both signaling and\\nmedia), the protocol\\'s trunking feature is attractive to both ITSPs and their customers\\ndue to the savings in bandwidth that can be obtained when running many simultaneous\\ncalls between endpoints.\\nIf your ITSP is offering IAX2 termination, there is a strong chance it is running Asterisk;\\nthus the configuration for connecting to these service providers is more than likely going\\nto be similar to what we are providing here.\\nThe following configuration is a template for connecting to an IAX2 service provider:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => username:password@my.service-provider.tld\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=user\\nsecret=my_unique_password\\ncontext=incoming_calls\\ntrunking=yes\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\n[my_unique_id]\\ntype=peer\\ntrunking=yes\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nTo accept incoming calls from the Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number that your service provider assigned to you, we need to modify our extensions.conf file. Perhaps you\\nwant to send the call to an auto-attendant, or maybe simply to your desk phone. In\\neither case, you can accept calls from your service provider and match on the incoming\\nDID with the following bit of dialplan logic:\\n\\n110 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\nexten => 14165551212,1,NoOp()\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Dial(SIP/1000,30)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 4165551212,1,Goto(1${EXTEN})\\n[internal]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX\\nOften it is desirable to connect two physical Asterisk boxes together via IAX in order\\nto send calls between two physical locations (the distance between these locations may\\nbe centimeters or kilometers). One of the advantages to using the IAX protocol to do\\nthis is a feature called trunking, which utilizes a method of sending the voice data for\\nmultiple calls at once with a single header. This has little effect on only one or two\\nsimultaneous calls, but if you are sending tens or hundreds of calls between two locations, the bandwidth savings by utilizing trunking can be tremendous.\\n\\nConfiguring a Local Firewall\\nIf you\\'re running iptables on the same machine as the Asterisk box, then you can run\\nthe following commands to open port 4569 for the IAX2 protocol. An excellent book\\non iptables firewalls is Linux Firewalls by Steve Suehring and Robert Ziegler (Novell\\nPress).\\n# iptables -I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp --dport 4569 -j ACCEPT\\n# service iptables save\\n\\nBe aware that this will allow all UDP traffic from any source access to port 4569.\\n\\nYou will need a timing interface installed on your system, whether it be\\nhardware from Digium or via the kernel by using the ztdummy driver.\\nThis will require you to have Zaptel installed on your system and running. See Chapter 3 for more information about installing Zaptel.\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX | 111\\n\\x0cConfiguring Our Asterisk Boxes\\nWe\\'ll be utilizing a simple topology where we have two Asterisk boxes registered to\\neach other directly, and separate phones registered to each Asterisk box. We\\'ll call the\\ntwo Asterisk boxes Toronto and Osakafi (see \"Connecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via SIP\"). Bob\\'s phone will be registered and connected to Toronto, while Alice\\'s\\nphone will be registered and connected to Osaka.\\nThe first thing we want to do is create a new channel file (iax.conf) by renaming the\\ncurrent sample file to iax.conf.sample and creating a new blank iax.conf:\\n# cd /etc/asterisk\\n# mv iax.conf iax.conf.sample\\n# touch iax.conf\\n\\nNext, open up the iax.conf file and enter the following configuration on the Toronto\\nAsterisk box:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => toronto:welcome@192.168.1.107\\n[osaka]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ntrunk=yes\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=incoming_osaka\\n\\nautokill=yes was explained in the previous section, but its purpose is to make sure new\\n\\ncalls being set up to a remote system that are not acknowledged within a reasonable\\namount of time (two seconds by default) are torn down correctly. This saves us from\\nhaving a lot of hung channels simply waiting for an acknowledgement that probably\\nisn\\'t coming.\\nThe register line is used to tell the remote Asterisk box where we are so that when the\\nbox at 192.168.1.107 is ready to send us a call, it sends it to our IP address (in this case\\nour IP address is 192.168.1.104, which you\\'ll see in the iax.conf configuration of the\\nOsaka box). We send the username Toronto and the password welcome to Osaka, which\\nauthenticates our registration, and if accepted, writes the location of our Asterisk box\\ninto its memory for when it needs to send us a call.\\nThe [Osaka] definition is used to control the authentication of the remote box and\\ndelivery into our dialplan. Osaka is the username used in the incoming authentication.\\nWe set the type to friend because we want to have both the ability to send calls to\\nOsaka and to receive calls from Osaka. The host option is set to dynamic which tells\\nAsterisk to send calls to the IP address obtained when the opposite endpoint registers\\nwith us.\\n112 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0cIn the introduction to this section, we mentioned the possible bandwidth savings when\\nutilizing IAX2 trunking. It\\'s simple to enable this functionality in Asterisk, as we just\\nneed to add trunk=yes to our friend definition. As long as a timing interface is installed\\nand running (i.e., dummy), then we can take advantage of IAX2 trunking.\\nThe secret is straightforward: it\\'s our authentication password. We\\'re defining the\\n[incoming_osaka] context as the place we will process incoming calls for this friend in\\nthe extensions.conf file. Finally, we block all IP addresses with the deny option from\\nbeing allowed to authenticate, and explicitly permit 192.168.1.107.\\nThe iax.conf configuration for Osaka is nearly identical, except for the changes in IP\\naddress and names:\\n[general]\\nautokill=yes\\nregister => osaka:welcome@192.168.1.104\\n[toronto]\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ntrunk=yes\\nsecret=welcome\\ncontext=incoming_toronto\\n\\nIAX Phone Configuration\\nIn the \"Configure the Softphone\" section, we configured our first IAX2 softphone using\\nidefisk. The configuration we\\'ll be using here is nearly identical except for minor\\nchanges in order to cause the peers to be unique. If you\\'ve already configured a SIP\\nsoftphone, then you can also utilize that on one (or both) of the peers. Remember that\\nAsterisk is a multiprotocol application, and you can send a call from a SIP phone to\\nAsterisk, across an IAX2 trunk, and then down to another SIP phone (or H.323, MGCP,\\netc.).\\nOn Osaka:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nOn Toronto:\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\ncontext=phones\\n\\nConnecting Two Asterisk Boxes Together via IAX | 113\\n\\x0cNext, configure your IAX2 softphone to register to Asterisk. If the phone successfully\\nregisters, you\\'ll see something like:\\n*CLI>\\n\\n\\nConfiguring the Dialplan\\nIn order to allow calling between our two Asterisk boxes over the IAX2 trunk, we need\\nto configure a simple dialplan. The following dialplan will send all extensions in the\\n1000 range (10001999) to Osaka, and all extensions in the 2000 range (20002999)\\nto Toronto. Our example is going to assume that you have configured a pair of IAX2\\nsoftphones, but feel free to utilize a SIP phone if you\\'ve already configured one (or two).\\nJust be aware that you\\'ll need to change the Dial() application to send the call to the\\nSIP phone via the SIP protocol instead of IAX2 (i.e. Dial(SIP/${EXTEN},30) instead of\\nDial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)).\\nThe extensions.conf file on Toronto:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/toronto/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[toronto_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nThe extensions.conf file on Osaka:\\n[globals]\\n[general]\\nautofallthrough=yes\\n[default]\\n\\n114 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c[incoming_calls]\\n[phones]\\ninclude => internal\\ninclude => remote\\n[internal]\\nexten => _2XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/${EXTEN},30)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Playback(the-party-you-are-calling&is-curntly-unavail)\\nexten => _2XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[remote]\\nexten => _1XXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Dial(IAX2/osaka/${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1XXX,n,Hangup()\\n[osaka_incoming]\\ninclude => internal\\n\\nUsing Templates in Your Configuration Files\\nThere is a little-known secret in Asterisk config files that is so brilliant that we had to\\ndevote a little section to it.\\nLet us say that you have 20 SIP phones that are all pretty much identical in terms of\\nhow they are configured. The documented way to create them is to specify the parameters for each. Part of such a sip.conf file might look like this:\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\n\\nUsing Templates in Your Configuration Files | 115\\n\\x0cdisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\n\\nSeems like a lot of extra typing, cutting, and pasting, yes? And what if you decide that\\nyou are going to change the context for your sets to another name. Not looking good,\\nis it?\\nEnter the template. Let\\'s create the same SIP friends as we did above, only this time\\nusing the template construct:\\n[sets](!) ; <== note the exclamation point in parenthesis. That makes this a template.\\ntype=friend\\ncontext=internal\\nhost=dynamic\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nsecret=AllYourSetsAreBelongToUs\\n[1000](sets) ; <== note the template name in parenthesis. All of that templates\\n; settings will be inhereted.\\n\\nThis is one of the best kept secrets of conf file creation. In our experience, very few\\npeople use this, but for no other reason than that they don\\'t know about it. Well, that\\'s\\nabout to change. Our goal is to see everyone using these from now on; and yes, we will\\nbe checking.\\n\\nDebugging\\nSeveral methods of debugging are available in Asterisk. Once you\\'ve connected to the\\nconsole, you can enable different levels of verbosity and debugging output, as well as\\nprotocol packet tracing. We\\'ll take a look at the various options in this section.\\n\\nConnecting to the Console\\nTo connect to the Asterisk console, you can either start the server in the console directly\\n(in which case you will not be able to exit out of the console without killing the Asterisk\\nprocess), or start Asterisk as a daemon and then connect to a remote console.\\nTo start the Asterisk process directly in the console, use the console flag:\\n\\n116 | Chapter 4: Initial Configuration of Asterisk\\n\\x0c# /usr/sbin/asterisk -c\\n\\nTo connect to a remote Asterisk console, start the daemon first and then connect with\\nthe -r flag:\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk\\n# /usr/sbin/asterisk -r\\n\\nIf you are having a problem with a specific module not loading, or a module causing\\nAsterisk to not load, start the Asterisk process with the -c flag to monitor the status of\\nmodules loading. For example, if you attempt to load the OSS channel driver (which\\nallows the use of the CONSOLE channel), and Asterisk is unable to open /dev/dsp, you will\\nreceive the following error on startup:\\nWARNING[32174]: chan_oss.c:470 soundcard_init: Unable to open /dev/dsp:\\nNo such file or directory\\n== No sound card detected -- console channel will be unavailable\\n== Turn off OSS support by adding \\'noload=chan_oss.so\\' in /etc/\\nasterisk/modules.conf\\n\\nEnabling Verbosity and Debugging\\nAsterisk can output debugging information in the form of WARNING, NOTICE, and ERROR\\nmessages. These messages will give you information about your system, such as registrations, status, and progression of calls, and various other useful bits of information.\\nNote that WARNING and NOTICE messages are not errors; however, ERROR messages should\\nbe investigated. To enable various levels of verbosity, use set verbose followed by a\\nnumerical value. Useful values range from 3 to 10. For example, to set the highest level\\nof verbosity, use:\\n# set verbose 10\\n\\nYou can also enable core debugging messages with set debug followed by a numerical\\nvalue. To enable DEBUG output on the console, you may need to enable it in the\\nlogger.conf file by adding debug to the console => statement, as follows:\\nconsole => warning,notice,error,event,debug\\n\\nUseful values for set debug range from 3 to 10. For example:\\n# set debug 10\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf you\\'ve worked through all of the sections in this chapter, you will have configured a\\npair of analog interfaces, a local SIP and IAX2 channel connected to a softphone and/\\nor a hardphone, and placed calls across servers using the SIP and IAX2 protocols. These\\nconfigurations are quite basic, but they give us functional channels to work with. We\\nwill make use of them in the following chapters, while we learn to build more useful\\ndialplans.\\n\\nConclusion | 117\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nDialplan Basics\\n\\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not\\nsimpler.\\n--Albert Einstein (18791955)\\n\\nThe dialplan is truly the heart of any Asterisk system, as it defines how Asterisk handles\\ninbound and outbound calls. In a nutshell, it consists of a list of instructions or steps\\nthat Asterisk will follow. Unlike traditional phone systems, Asterisk\\'s dialplan is fully\\ncustomizable. To successfully set up your own Asterisk system, you will need to understand the dialplan.\\nIf you have attempted to read some sample dialplans and found them overwhelming,\\nor if you\\'ve tried to write an Asterisk dialplan and had no success, help is at hand. This\\nchapter explains how dialplans work in a step-by-step manner and teaches the skills\\nnecessary to create your own. The examples have been designed to build upon one\\nanother, so feel free to go back and reread a section if something doesn\\'t quite make\\nsense. Please also note that this chapter is by no means an exhaustive survey of all the\\npossible things dialplans can do; our aim is to cover just the fundamentals. We\\'ll cover\\nmore advanced dialplan topics in later chapters.\\n\\nDialplan Syntax\\nThe Asterisk dialplan is specified in the configuration file named extensions.conf.\\nThe extensions.conf file usually resides in the /etc/asterisk/ directory, but\\nits location may vary depending on how you installed Asterisk. Other\\ncommon locations for this file include /usr/local/asterisk/etc/\\nand /opt/asterisk/etc/.\\n\\nThe dialplan is made up of four main concepts: contexts, extensions, priorities, and\\napplications. In the next few sections, we\\'ll cover each of these parts and explain how\\n\\x0cthey work together. After explaining the role each of these elements plays in the\\ndialplan, we will step you though the process of creating a basic, functioning dialplan.\\n\\nSample Configuration Files\\nIf you installed the sample configuration files when you installed Asterisk, you will most\\nlikely have an existing extensions.conf file. Instead of starting with the sample file, we\\nsuggest that you build your extensions.conf file from scratch. This will be very beneficial,\\nas it will give you a better understanding of dialplan concepts and fundamentals.\\nThat being said, the sample extensions.conf file remains a fantastic resource, full of\\nexamples and ideas that you can use after you\\'ve learned the basic concepts. We suggest\\nyou rename the sample file to something like extensions.conf.sample. That way, you\\ncan refer to it in the future. You can also find the sample configuration files in\\nthe /configs/ directory of the Asterisk source.\\n\\nContexts\\nDialplans are broken into sections called contexts. Contexts are named groups of extensions, which serve several purposes.\\nContexts keep different parts of the dialplan from interacting with one another. An\\nextension that is defined in one context is completely isolated from extensions in any\\nother context, unless interaction is specifically allowed. (We\\'ll cover how to allow interaction between contexts near the end of the chapter.)\\nAs a simple example, let\\'s imagine we have two companies sharing an Asterisk server.\\nIf we place each company\\'s voice menu in its own context, they are effectively separated\\nfrom each other. This allows us to independently define what happens when, say, extension 0 is dialed: people pressing 0 at Company A\\'s voice menu will get Company\\nA\\'s receptionist, and callers pressing 0 at Company B\\'s voice menu will get Company\\nB\\'s receptionist. (This example assumes, of course, that we\\'ve told Asterisk to transfer\\nthe calls to the receptionists when callers press 0.)\\nContexts are denoted by placing the name of the context inside square brackets ([ ]).\\nThe name can be made up of the letters A through Z (upper- and lowercase), the numbers 0 through 9, and the hyphen and underscore.* For example, a context for incoming\\ncalls looks like this:\\n[incoming]\\n\\n* Please note that the space is conspicuously absent from the list of allowed characters. Don\\'t use spaces in\\n\\nyour context names--you won\\'t like the result!\\n\\n120 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cContext names have a maximum length of 79 characters (80 characters\\n1 terminating null)\\n\\nAll of the instructions placed after a context definition are part of that context, until\\nthe next context is defined. At the beginning of the dialplan, there are two special\\ncontexts named [general] and [globals]. The [general] section contains a list of general dialplan settings (which you\\'ll probably never have to worry about), and we will\\ndiscuss the [globals] context the \"Global variables\" section; for now it\\'s just important\\nto know that these two contexts are special. As long as you avoid the names [gen\\neral] and [globals], you may name your contexts anything you like.\\nWhen you define a channel (which is how you connect things to the system), one of\\nthe parameters that is defined in the channel definition is the context. In other words,\\nthe context is the point in the dialplan where connections from that channel will begin.\\nAnother important use of contexts (perhaps the most important) is to provide security.\\nBy using contexts correctly, you can give certain callers access to features (such as longdistance calling) that aren\\'t made available to others. If you don\\'t design your dialplan\\ncarefully, you may inadvertently allow others to fraudulently use your system. Please\\nkeep this in mind as you build your Asterisk system.\\nThe doc/ subdirectory of the Asterisk source code contains a very important file named security.txt, which outlines several steps you should\\ntake to keep your Asterisk system secure. It is vitally important that you\\nread and understand this file. If you ignore the security precautions\\noutlined there, you may end up allowing anyone and everyone to make\\nlong-distance or toll calls at your expense!\\nIf you don\\'t take the security of your Asterisk system seriously, you may\\nend up paying--literally! Please take the time and effort to secure your\\nsystem from toll fraud.\\n\\nExtensions\\nIn the world of telecommunications, the word extension usually refers to a numeric\\nidentifier given to a line that rings a particular phone. In Asterisk, however, an extension\\nis far more powerful, as it defines a unique series of steps (each step containing an\\napplication) that Asterisk will take that call through. Within each context, we can define\\nas many (or few) extensions as required. When a particular extension is triggered (by\\nan incoming call or by digits being dialed on a channel), Asterisk will follow the steps\\ndefined for that extension. It is the extensions, therefore, that specify what happens to\\ncalls as they make their way through the dialplan. Although extensions can certainly\\nbe used to specify phone extensions in the traditional sense (i.e., extension 153 will\\n\\nDialplan Syntax | 121\\n\\x0ccause the SIP telephone set on John\\'s desk to ring), in an Asterisk dialplan, they can be\\nused for much more.\\nThe syntax for an extension is the word exten, followed by an arrow formed by the\\nequals sign and the greater-than sign, like this:\\nexten =>\\n\\nThis is followed by the name (or number) of the extension. When dealing with traditional telephone systems, we tend to think of extensions as the numbers you would\\ndial to make another phone ring. In Asterisk, you get a whole lot more; for example,\\nextension names can be any combination of numbers and letters. Over the course of\\nthis chapter and the next, we\\'ll use both numeric and alphanumeric extensions.\\nAssigning names to extensions may seem like a revolutionary concept,\\nbut when you realize that many VoIP transports support (or even actively encourage) dialing by name or email address instead of only\\ndialing by number, it makes perfect sense. This is one of the features\\nthat makes Asterisk so flexible and powerful.\\n\\nA complete extension is composed of three components:\\n The name (or number) of the extension\\n The priority (each extension can include multiple steps; the step number is called\\nthe \"priority\")\\n The application (or command) that performs some action on the call\\nThese three components are separated by commas, like this:\\nexten => name,priority,application()\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example of what a real extension might look like:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\n\\nIn this example, the extension name is 123, the priority is 1, and the application is\\nAnswer(). Now, let\\'s move ahead and explain priorities and applications.\\n\\nPriorities\\nEach extension can have multiple steps, called priorities. Each priority is numbered\\nsequentially, starting with 1, and executes one specific application. As an example, the\\nfollowing extension would answer the phone (in priority number 1), and then hang it\\nup (in priority number 2):\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,Hangup()\\n\\n122 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cDon\\'t worry if you don\\'t understand what Answer() and Hangup() are--we\\'ll cover\\nthem shortly. The key point to remember here is that for a particular extension, Asterisk\\nfollows the priorities in order.\\n\\nUnnumbered priorities\\nIn older releases of Asterisk, the numbering of priorities caused a lot of problems.\\nImagine having an extension that had 15 priorities, and then needing to add something\\nat step 2. All of the subsequent priorities would have to be manually renumbered.\\nAsterisk does not handle missing steps or misnumbered priorities, and debugging these\\ntypes of errors was pointless and frustrating.\\nBeginning with version 1.2, Asterisk addressed this problem. It introduced the use of\\nthe n priority, which stands for \"next.\" Each time Asterisk encounters a priority named\\nn, it takes the number of the previous priority and adds 1. This makes it easier to make\\nchanges to your dialplan, as you don\\'t have to keep renumbering all your steps. For\\nexample, your dialplan might look something like this:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n123,n,do something else\\n123,n,do one last thing\\n\\nInternally, Asterisk will calculate the next priority number every time it encounters an\\nn. You should note, however, that you must always specify priority number 1. If you\\naccidentally put an n instead of 1 for the first priority, you\\'ll find that the extension will\\nnot be available.\\n\\nPriority labels\\nStarting with Asterisk version 1.2 and higher, common practice is to assign text labels\\nto priorities. This is to ensure that you can refer to a priority by something other than\\nits number, which probably isn\\'t known, given that dialplans now generally use unnumbered priorities. To assign a text label to a priority, simply add the label inside\\nparentheses after the priority, like this:\\nexten => 123,n(label),application()\\n\\nA very common mistake when writing labels is to insert a comma between the n and the (, like this:\\nexten => 123,n,(label),application() ;<-- THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK\\n\\nThis mistake will break that part of your dialplan, and you will get an\\nerror that the application cannot be found.\\n Asterisk permits simple arithmetic within the priority, such as n+200 or the priority s (for same), but their\\n\\nusage is considered to be an advanced topic. Please note that extension s and priority s are two distinct\\nconcepts.\\n\\nDialplan Syntax | 123\\n\\x0cIn the next chapter, we\\'ll cover how to jump between different priorities based on\\ndialplan logic. You\\'ll be seeing a lot more of priority labels, and you will be using them\\noften in your dialplans.\\n\\nApplications\\nApplications are the workhorses of the dialplan. Each application performs a specific\\naction on the current channel, such as playing a sound, accepting touch-tone input,\\ndialing a channel, hanging up the call, and so forth. In the previous example, you were\\nintroduced to two simple applications: Answer() and Hangup(). You\\'ll learn more about\\nhow these work momentarily.\\nSome applications, such as Answer()and Hangup(), need no other instructions to do their\\njobs. Other applications require additional information. These pieces of information,\\ncalled arguments, can be passed on to the applications to affect how they perform their\\nactions. To pass arguments to an application, place them between the parentheses that\\nfollow the application name, separated by commas.\\nOccasionally, you may also see the pipe character (|) being used as a\\nseparator between arguments, instead of a comma. Feel free to use\\nwhichever you prefer. For the examples in this book, we will be using\\nthe comma to separate arguments to an application, as the authors prefer the look of this syntax. You should be aware, however, that when\\nAsterisk parses the dialplan, it converts any commas in the application\\narguments to pipes.\\n\\nAs we build our first dialplan in the next section, you\\'ll learn to use applications (and\\ntheir associated arguments) to your advantage.\\n\\nA Simple Dialplan\\nNow we\\'re ready to create our first dialplan. We\\'ll start with a very simple example.\\nWe are going to instruct Asterisk to answer a call, play a sound file, and hang up. We\\'ll\\nuse this simple example to point out the most important dialplan fundamentals.\\nFor the examples in this chapter to work correctly, we\\'re assuming that at least one\\nchannel (either Zap, SIP, or IAX2) has been created and configured (as described in the\\nprevious chapter), and that all calls coming into that channel enter the dialplan at the\\n[incoming] context. If you have been creative with any previous examples, you may\\nneed to make adjustments to fit your particular channel names.\\n\\n124 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cThe s Extension\\nBecause of the technology we are using in our channels, we need to cover one more\\nthing before we get started with our dialplan. We need to explain extension s. When\\ncalls enter a context without a specific destination extension (for example, a ringing\\nFXO line), they are passed to the s extension. (The s stands for \"start,\" as this is where\\na call will start if no extension information was passed with the call.)\\nSince this is exactly what we need for our dialplan, let\\'s begin to fill in the pieces. We\\nwill be performing three actions on the call (answer it, play a sound file, and hang it\\nup), so our extension called s will need three priorities. We\\'ll place the three priorities\\nbelow [incoming], because we have decided that all incoming calls should start in this\\ncontext.\\n[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,application()\\nexten => s,n,application()\\nexten => s,n,application()\\n\\nNow all we need to do is fill in the applications, and we\\'ve created our first dialplan.\\nNote that we could have numbered each priority as shown below, but\\nthis is no longer the preferred method, as it makes it harder to make\\nchanges to the dialplan at a later time:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,application()\\nexten => s,2,application()\\nexten => s,3,application()\\n\\nThe Answer(), Playback(), and Hangup() Applications\\nIf we\\'re going to answer the call, play a sound file, and then hang up, we\\'d better learn\\nhow to do just that. The Answer() application is used to answer a channel that is ringing.\\nThis does the initial setup for the channel that receives the incoming call. (A few applications don\\'t require that you answer the channel first, but properly answering the\\nchannel before performing any other actions is a very good habit.) As we mentioned\\nearlier, Answer() takes no arguments.\\nThe Playback() application is used for playing a previously recorded sound file over a\\nchannel. When using the Playback() application, input from the user is simply ignored.\\n\\n There\\n\\nis nothing special about any context name. We could have named this context\\n[stuff_that_comes_in], and as long as that was the context assigned in the channel definition in sip.conf,\\niax.conf, zaptel.conf, et al., the channel would enter the dialplan in that context. Having said that, it is strongly\\nrecommended that you give your contexts names that help you to understand their purpose. Some good\\ncontext names might include [incoming], [local_calls], [long_distance], [sip_telephones], [user_services],\\n[experimental], [remote_locations], and so forth. Always remember that a context determines how a channel\\nenters the dialplan, so name accordingly.\\n\\nA Simple Dialplan | 125\\n\\x0cAsterisk comes with many professionally recorded sound files, which\\nshould be found in the default sounds directory (usually /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/). When you compile Asterisk, you can choose\\nto install various sets of sample sounds that have been recorded in a\\nvariety of languages and file formats. We\\'ll be using these files in many\\nof our examples. Several of the files in our examples come from the Extra\\nSound Package, so please take the time to install it (see Chapter 3). You\\ncan also have your own sound prompts recorded in the same voices as\\nthe stock prompts by visiting http://thevoice.digium.com/.\\n\\nTo use Playback(), specify a filename (without a file extension) as the argument. For\\nexample, Playback(filename) would play the sound file called filename.gsm, assuming\\nit was located in the default sounds directory. Note that you can include the full path\\nto the file if you want, like this:\\nPlayback(/home/john/sounds/filename)\\n\\nThe previous example would play filename.gsm from the /home/john/sounds/ directory.\\nYou can also use relative paths from the Asterisk sounds directory as follows:\\nPlayback(custom/filename)\\n\\nThis example would play filename.gsm from the custom/ subdirectory of the default\\nsounds directory (probably /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/filename.gsm). Note that if\\nthe specified directory contains more than one file with that filename but with different\\nfile extensions, Asterisk automatically plays the best file.\\nThe Hangup() application does exactly as its name implies: it hangs up the active channel. You should use this application at the end of a context when you want to end the\\ncurrent call to ensure that callers don\\'t continue on in the dialplan in a way you might\\nnot have anticipated. The Hangup() application takes no arguments.\\n\\nOur First Dialplan\\nNow that we have designed our extension, let\\'s put together all the pieces to create our\\nfirst dialplan. As is typical in many technology books (especially computer programming books), our first example will be called \"Hello World!\"\\nIn the first priority of our extension, we\\'ll answer the call. In the second, we\\'ll play a\\nsound file named hello-world.gsm, and in the third we\\'ll hang up the call. Here\\'s what\\nthe dialplan looks like:\\n Asterisk selects the best file based on translation costthat is, it selects the file that is the least CPU-intensive\\n\\nto convert to its native audio format. When you start Asterisk, it calculates the translation costs between the\\ndifferent audio formats (they often vary from system to system). You can see these translation costs by typing\\nshow translation at the Asterisk command-line interface. The numbers shown represent how many\\nmilliseconds it takes Asterisk to transcode one second of audio. We\\'ll cover more about the different audio\\nformats (known as codecs) in Chapter 8.\\n\\n126 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c[incoming]\\nexten => s,1,Answer()\\nexten => s,n,Playback(hello-world)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nIf you have a channel or two configured, go ahead and try it out! Simply create a file\\ncalled extensions.conf, (probably in /etc/asterisk) and insert the four lines of dialplan\\ncode we just designed. If it doesn\\'t work, check the Asterisk console for error messages,\\nand make sure your channels are assigned to the [incoming] context.\\nEven though this example is very short and simple, it emphasizes the core concepts of\\ncontexts, extensions, priorities, and applications. If you can get this to work, you have\\nthe fundamental knowledge on which all dialplans are built.\\nLet\\'s build upon our example. After all, a phone system that simply plays a sound file\\nand then hangs up the channel isn\\'t that useful!\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan\\nThe dialplan we just built was static; it will always perform the same actions on every\\ncall. We are going to start adding some logic to our dialplan so that it will perform\\ndifferent actions based on input from the user. To do this, we\\'re going to need to\\nintroduce a few more applications.\\n\\nThe Background(), WaitExten(), and Goto() Applications\\nOne of the most important keys to building interactive Asterisk dialplans is the Back\\nground()# application. Like Playback(), it plays a recorded sound file. Unlike\\nPlayback(), however, when the caller presses a key (or series of keys) on her telephone\\nkeypad, it interrupts the playback and goes to the extension that corresponds with the\\npressed digit(s). If a caller presses 5, for example, Asterisk will stop playing the sound\\nprompt and send control of the call to the first priority of extension 5.\\nThe most common use of the Background() application is to create voice menus (often\\ncalled auto-attendants or phone trees). Many companies use voice menus to direct callers to the proper extensions, thus relieving their receptionists from having to answer\\nevery single call.\\n\\n In fact, if you don\\'t have any channels configured, now is the time to do so. There is a real satisfaction that\\n\\ncomes from passing your first call into an Asterisk system that you built from scratch. People get this funny\\ngrin on their face as they realize that they have just created a telephone system. This pleasure can be yours\\nas well, so please, don\\'t go any further until you have made this little dialplan work.\\n# It should be noted that some people expect that Background(), due to its name, would continue in the dialplan\\n\\nwhile the sound is being played, but its name refers to the fact that it is playing a sound in the background,\\nwhile waiting for DTMF in the foreground.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 127\\n\\x0cBackground() has the same syntax as Playback():\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\n\\nIn earlier versions of Asterisk, if the Background() application finished playing the sound\\nprompt and there were no more priorities in the current extension, Asterisk would sit\\nand wait for input from the caller. Asterisk no longer does this by default. If you want\\nAsterisk to wait for input from the caller after the sound prompt has finished playing,\\nyou can call the WaitExten() application. The WaitExten() application waits for the\\ncaller to enter DTMF digits, and is frequently called directly after the Background()\\napplication, like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\n\\nIf you\\'d like the WaitExten() application to wait a specific number of seconds for a\\nresponse (instead of using the default timeout), simply pass the number of seconds as\\nthe first argument to WaitExten(), like this:\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten(5)\\n\\nBoth Background() and WaitExten() allow the caller to enter DTMF digits. Asterisk then\\nattempts to find an extension in the current context that matches the digits that the\\ncaller entered. If Asterisk finds an unambiguous match, it will send the call to that\\nextension. Let\\'s demonstrate by adding a few lines to our example:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 4,1,Playback(digits/4)\\n\\nIf you call into extension 123 in the example above, it will play a sound prompt that\\nsays \"main menu.\" It will then wait for you to enter either 2, 3, or 4. If you press one\\nof those digits, Asterisk will read that digit back to you. You\\'ll also find that if you enter\\na different digit (such as 5), it won\\'t give you what you expected.\\nIt is also possible that Asterisk will find an ambiguous match. This can be easily explained if we add an extension named 1 to the previous example:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\n\\n128 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 4,1,Playback(digits/4)\\n\\nDial extension 123, and then at the main menu prompt dial 1. Why doesn\\'t Asterisk\\nimmediately read back the number one to you? It\\'s because the digit 1 is ambiguous;\\nAsterisk doesn\\'t know whether you\\'re trying to go to extension 1 or extension 123. It\\nwaits a few seconds to see if you\\'re going to dial another digit (such as the 2 in extension\\n123). If you don\\'t dial any more digits, Asterisk will eventually time out and send the\\ncall to extension 1. (We\\'ll learn how to choose our own timeout values in Chapter 6.)\\nBefore going on, let\\'s review what we\\'ve done so far. When users call into our dialplan,\\nthey will hear a greeting. If they press 1, they will hear the number one, and if they press\\n2, they will hear the number two, and so on. While that\\'s a good start, let\\'s embellish\\nit a little. We\\'ll use the Goto() application to make the dialplan repeat the greeting after\\nplaying back the number.\\nAs its name implies, the Goto() application is used to send the call to another part of\\nthe dialplan. The syntax for the Goto() application requires us to pass the destination\\ncontext, extension, and priority on as arguments to the application, like this:\\nexten => 123,n,Goto(context,extension,priority)\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use the Goto() application in our dialplan:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(main-menu)\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 1,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 2,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\n\\nThese two new lines (highlighted in bold) will send control of the call back to the 123\\nextension after playing back the selected number.\\nIf you look up the details of the Goto() application, you\\'ll find that you\\ncan actually pass either one, two, or three arguments to the application.\\nIf you pass a single argument, Asterisk will assume it\\'s the destination\\npriority in the current extension. If you pass two arguments, Asterisk\\nwill treat them as the extension and priority to go to in the current\\ncontext.\\nIn this example, we\\'ve passed all three arguments for the sake of clarity,\\nbut passing just the extension and priority would have had the same\\neffect.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 129\\n\\x0cHandling Invalid Entries and Timeouts\\nNow that our first voice menu is starting to come together, let\\'s add some additional\\nspecial extensions. First, we need an extension for invalid entries; when a caller presses\\nan invalid entry (e.g., pressing 9 in the above example), the call is sent to the i extension.\\nSecond, we need an extension to handle situations when the caller doesn\\'t give input\\nin time (the default timeout is 10 seconds). Calls will be sent to the t extension if the\\ncaller takes too long to press a digit after WaitExten() has been called. Here is what our\\ndialplan will look like after we\\'ve added these two extensions:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => 1,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 2,1,Playback(digits/2)\\nexten => 2,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => 3,1,Playback(digits/3)\\nexten => 3,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n\\nUsing the i and t extensions makes our dialplan a little more robust and user-friendly.\\nThat being said, it is still quite limited, because outside callers have no way of connecting to a live person. To do that, we\\'ll need to learn about another application, called\\nDial().\\n\\nUsing the Dial() Application\\nOne of Asterisk\\'s most valuable features is its ability to connect different callers to each\\nother. This is especially useful when callers are using different methods of communication. For example, caller A might be communicating over the traditional analog\\ntelephone network, while user B might be sitting in a caf halfway around the world\\nand speaking on an IP telephone. Luckily, Asterisk takes most of the hard work out of\\nconnecting and translating between disparate networks. All you have to do is learn how\\nto use the Dial() application.\\nThe syntax of the Dial() application is a little more complex than that of the other\\napplications we\\'ve used so far, but don\\'t let that scare you off. Dial() takes up to four\\narguments. The first is the destination you\\'re attempting to call, which (in its simplest\\nform) is made up of a technology (or transport) across which to make the call, a forward\\n\\n130 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cslash, and the remote endpoint or resource. Common technology types include Zap\\n(for analog and T1/E1/J1 channels), SIP, and IAX2. For example, let\\'s assume that we\\nwant to call a Zap endpoint identified by Zap/1, which is an FXS channel with an analog\\nphone plugged into it. The technology is Zap, and the resource is 1. Similarly, a call to\\na SIP device (as defined in sip.conf) might have a destination of SIP/Jane, and a call to\\nan IAX device (defined in iax.conf) might have a destination of IAX2/Fred. If we wanted\\nAsterisk to ring the Zap/1 channel when extension 123 is reached in the dialplan, we\\'d\\nadd the following extension:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\n\\nWe can also dial multiple channels at the same time, by concatenating the destinations\\nwith an ampersand (&), like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1&Zap/2&SIP/Jane)\\n\\nThe Dial() application will ring the specified destinations simultaneously, and bridge\\nthe inbound call with whichever destination channel answers the call first. If the Dial\\n() application can\\'t contact any of the destinations, Asterisk will set a variable called\\nDIALSTATUS with the reason that it couldn\\'t dial the destinations, and continue on with\\nthe next priority in the extension.*\\nThe Dial() application also allows you to connect to a remote VoIP endpoint not previously defined in one of the channel configuration files. The full syntax for this type\\nof connection is:\\nDial(technology/user[:password]@remote_host[:port][/remote_extension])\\n\\nAs an example, you can dial into a demonstration server at Digium using the IAX2\\nprotocol by using the following extension:\\nexten => 500,1,Dial(IAX2/guest@misery.digium.com/s)\\n\\nThe full syntax for the Dial() application is slightly different when dealing with Zap\\nchannels, as shown:\\nDial(Zap/[gGrR]channel_or_group[/remote_extension])\\n\\nFor example, here is how you would dial 1-800-555-1212 on Zap channel number 4.\\nexten => 501,1,Dial(Zap/4/18005551212)\\n\\nThe second argument to the Dial() application is a timeout, specified in seconds. If a\\ntimeout is given, Dial() will attempt to call the destination(s) for that number of seconds before giving up and moving on to the next priority in the extension. If no timeout\\nis specified, Dial() will continue to dial the called channel(s) until someone answers\\nor the caller hangs up. Let\\'s add a timeout of 10 seconds to our extension:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\n\\n* Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll cover variables (in \"Using Variables\") and show you how to have your dialplan make\\n\\ndecisions based on the value of this DIALSTATUS variable.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 131\\n\\x0cIf the call is answered before the timeout, the channels are bridged and the dialplan is\\ndone. If the destination simply does not answer, is busy, or is otherwise unavailable,\\nAsterisk will set a variable called DIALSTATUS and then continue on with the next priority\\nin the extension.\\nLet\\'s put what we\\'ve learned so far into another example:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 123,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 123,n,Hangup()\\n\\nAs you can see, this example will play the vm-nobodyavail.gsm sound file if the call goes\\nunanswered.\\nThe third argument to Dial() is an option string. It may contain one or more characters\\nthat modify the behavior of the Dial() application. While the list of possible options\\nis too long to cover here, one of the most popular options is the m option. If you place\\nthe letter m as the third argument, the calling party will hear hold music instead of\\nringing while the destination channel is being called (assuming, of course, that music\\non hold has been configured correctly). To add the m option to our last example, we\\nsimply change the first line:\\nexten => 123,1,Dial(Zap/1,10,m)\\nexten => 123,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 123,n,Hangup()\\n\\nSince the extensions numbered 1 and 2 in our dialplan are somewhat useless now that\\nwe know how to use the Dial() application, let\\'s replace them with new extensions\\nthat will allow outside callers to reach John and Jane:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThe fourth and final argument to the Dial() application is a URL. If the destination\\nchannel supports receiving a URL at the time of the call, the specified URL will be sent\\n(for example, if you have an IP telephone that supports receiving a URL, it will appear\\n\\n132 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0con the phone\\'s display; likewise, if you\\'re using a soft phone, the URL might pop up\\non your computer screen). This argument is very rarely used.\\nNote that the second, third, and fourth arguments may be left blank. For example, if\\nyou want to specify an option but not a timeout, simply leave the timeout argument\\nblank, like this:\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,,m)\\n\\nAdding a Context for Internal Calls\\nIn our examples thus far, we have limited ourselves to a single context, but it is probably\\nfair to assume that almost all Asterisk installations will have more than one context in\\ntheir dialplans. As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, one important function of contexts is to separate privileges (such as making long-distance calls or calling\\ncertain extensions) for different classes of callers. In our next example, we\\'ll add to our\\ndialplan by creating two internal phone extensions, and we\\'ll set up the ability for these\\ntwo extensions to call each other. To accomplish this, we\\'ll create a new context called\\n[employees].\\nAs in previous examples, we\\'ve assumed that an FXS analog channel\\n(Zap/1, in this case) has already been configured, and that your\\nzapata.conf file is configured so that any calls originated by Zap/1 begin\\nin the [employees] context. For a few examples at the end of the chapter,\\nwe\\'ll also assume that an FXO Zap channel has been configured as Zap/\\n4, with calls coming in on this channel being sent to the [incoming]\\ncontext.\\nWe\\'ve also assumed you have at least one SIP channel (named SIP/\\nJane) that is configured to originate in the [employees] context. We\\'ve\\ndone this to introduce you to using other types of channels.\\nIf you don\\'t have hardware for the channels listed above (such as Zap/\\n4), or if you\\'re using hardware with different channel names (e.g., not\\nSIP/Jane), just change the examples to match your particular system\\nconfiguration.\\n\\nOur dialplan now looks like this:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 133\\n\\x0cexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\n\\nIn this example, we have added two new extensions to the [employees] context. This\\nway, the person using channel Zap/1 can pick up the phone and dial the person at\\nchannel SIP/Jane by dialing 102. By that same token, the phone registered as SIP/\\nJane can dial Zap/1 by dialing 101.\\nWe\\'ve arbitrarily decided to use extensions 101 and 102 for our examples, but feel free\\nto use whatever numbering convention you wish for your extensions. You should also\\nbe aware that you\\'re not limited to three-digit extensions; you can use as few or as many\\ndigits as you like. (Well, almost. Extensions must be shorter than 80 characters long,\\nand you shouldn\\'t use single-character extensions for your own use, as they\\'re reserved.) Don\\'t forget that you can use names as well, like so:\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(Zap/1,10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(SIP/Jane,10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => john,1,Dial(Zap/1)\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\nexten => jane,1,Dial(SIP/Jane)\\n\\nIt certainly wouldn\\'t hurt to add named extensions if you think your users might be\\ndialed via a VoIP protocol such as SIP that supports dialing by name. You can also see\\n\\n134 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cthat it is possible to have different extensions in the dialplan ring the same endpoint.\\nFor example, you could have extension 200 ring SIP/George, and then have extension\\n201 play a prompt of some kind and then ring SIP/George.\\nNow that our internal callers can call each other, we\\'re well on our way toward having\\na complete dialplan. Next, we\\'ll see how we can make our dialplan more scalable and\\neasier to modify in the future.\\n\\nUsing Variables\\nVariables can be used in an Asterisk dialplan to help reduce typing, add clarity, or add\\nadditional logic to a dialplan. If you have some computer programming experience,\\nyou probably already understand what a variable is. If not, don\\'t worry; we\\'ll explain\\nwhat variables are and how they are used.\\nYou can think of a variable as a container that can hold one value at a time. So, for\\nexample, we might create a variable called JOHN and assign it the value of Zap/1. This\\nway, when we\\'re writing our dialplan, we can refer to John\\'s channel by name, instead\\nof remembering that John is using the channel named Zap/1.\\nThere are two ways to reference a variable. To reference the variable\\'s name, simply\\ntype the name of the variable, such as JOHN. If, on the other hand, you want to reference\\nits value, you must type a dollar sign, an opening curly brace, the name of the variable,\\nand a closing curly brace. Here\\'s how we\\'d reference the variable inside the Dial()\\napplication:\\nexten => 555,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\n\\nIn our dialplan, whenever we write ${JOHN}, Asterisk will automatically replace it with\\nwhatever value has been assigned to the variable named JOHN.\\nNote that variable names are case-sensitive. A variable named JOHN is\\ndifferent than a variable named John. For readability\\'s sake, all the variable names in the examples will be written in uppercase. You should\\nalso be aware that any variables set by Asterisk will be uppercase as well.\\nSome variables, such as CHANNEL or EXTEN are reserved by Asterisk. You\\nshould not attempt to set these variables.\\n\\nThere are three types of variables we can use in our dialplan: global variables, channel\\nvariables, and environment variables. Let\\'s take a moment to look at each type.\\n\\nGlobal variables\\nAs their name implies, global variables apply to all extensions in all contexts. Global\\nvariables are useful in that they can be used anywhere within a dialplan to increase\\nreadability and manageability. Suppose for a moment that you had a large dialplan and\\nseveral hundred references to the Zap/1 channel. Now imagine you had to go through\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 135\\n\\x0cyour dialplan and change all of those references to Zap/2. It would be a long and errorprone process, to say the least.\\nOn the other hand, if you had defined a global variable with the value Zap/1 at the\\nbeginning of your dialplan and then referenced that instead, you would have to change\\nonly one line.\\nGlobal variables should be declared in the [globals] context at the beginning of the\\nextensions.conf file. They can also be defined programmatically, using the GLOBAL()\\ndialplan function. Here is an example of how both methods look inside of a dialplan.\\nThe first shows the setting of a global variable named JOHN with a value of Zap/1. This\\nvariable is set at the time Asterisk parses the dialplan. The second example shows how\\na global variable can be set in the dialplan. In this case, the variable named George is\\nbeing assigned the value of SIP/George when extension 124 is dialed in the [employees]\\ncontext:\\n[globals]\\n[employees]\\nexten => 124,1,Set(GLOBAL(GEORGE)=SIP/George)\\n\\nChannel variables\\nA channel variable is a variable that is associated only with a particular call. Unlike\\nglobal variables, channel variables are defined only for the duration of the current call\\nand are available only to the channels participating in that call.\\nThere are many predefined channel variables available for use within the dialplan,\\nwhich are explained in the channelvariables.txt file in the doc subdirectory of the Asterisk source. Channel variables are set via the Set() application:\\nexten => 125,1,Set(MAGICNUMBER=42)\\n\\nWe\\'ll cover many uses for channel variables in Chapter 6.\\n\\nEnvironment variables\\nEnvironment variables are a way of accessing Unix environment variables from within\\nAsterisk. These are referenced using the ENV() dialplan function. The syntax looks like\\n${ENV(var)}, where var is the Unix environment variable you wish to reference. Environment variables aren\\'t commonly used in Asterisk dialplans, but they are available\\nshould you need them.\\n\\nAdding variables to our dialplan\\nNow that we\\'ve learned about variables, let\\'s put them to work in our dialplan. We\\'ll\\nadd global variables for two people, John and Jane:\\n Don\\'t worry! We\\'ll cover dialplan functions in the \"Dialplan Functions\" section.\\n\\n136 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(${JANE},10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => john,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => 102,1,Dial(${JANE})\\nexten => jane,1,Dial(${JANE})\\n\\nPattern Matching\\nIf we want to be able to allow people to dial through Asterisk and have Asterisk connect\\nthe caller to an outside resource, we need a way to match on any possible phone number\\nthat the caller might dial. Can you imagine how tedious it would be to manually write\\na dialplan with an extension for every possible number you could dial? Luckily, Asterisk\\nhas just the thing for situations like this: pattern matching. Pattern matching allows you\\nto create one extension in your dialplan that matches many different numbers.\\n\\nPattern-matching syntax\\nWhen using pattern matching, certain letters and symbols represent what we are trying\\nto match. Patterns always start with an underscore (_). This tells Asterisk that we\\'re\\nmatching on a pattern, and not on an explicit extension name. (This means, of course,\\nthat you should never start your extension names with an underscore.)\\nIf you forget the underscore on the front of your pattern, Asterisk will\\nthink it\\'s just a named extension and won\\'t do any pattern matching.\\nThis is one of the most common mistakes people make when starting\\nto learn Asterisk.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 137\\n\\x0cAfter the underscore, you can use one or more of the following characters.\\nX\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 0 to 9.\\nZ\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 1 to 9.\\nN\\n\\nMatches any single digit from 2 to 9.\\n\\nMatches a single digit from the range of digits specified. In this case, the pattern\\nmatches a single 1, 5, 6, or 7.\\n. (period)\\nWildcard match; matches one or more characters, no matter what they are.\\nIf you\\'re not careful, wildcard matches can make your dialplans do\\nthings you\\'re not expecting (like matching built-in extensions such\\nas i or h). You should use the wildcard match in a pattern only after\\nyou\\'ve matched as many other digits as possible. For example, the\\nfollowing pattern match should probably never be used:\\n_.\\n\\nIn fact, Asterisk will warn you if you try to use it. Instead, use this\\none, if at all possible:\\n_X.\\n\\n! (bang)\\nWildcard match; matches zero or more characters, no matter what they are.\\nTo use pattern matching in your dialplan, simply put the pattern in the place of the\\nextension name (or number):\\nexten => _NXX,1,Playback(auth-thankyou)\\n\\nIn this example, the pattern matches any three-digit extension from 200 through 999\\n(the N matches any digit between 2 and 9, and each X matches a digit between 0 and 9).\\nThat is to say, if a caller dialed any three-digit extension between 200 and 999 in this\\ncontext, he would hear the sound file auth-thankyou.gsm.\\nOne other important thing to know about pattern matching is that if Asterisk finds\\nmore than one pattern that matches the dialed extension, it will use the most specific\\none (going from left to right). Say you had defined the following two patterns, and a\\ncaller dialed 555-1212:\\nexten => _555XXXX,1,Playback(digits/1)\\nexten => _55512XX,1,Playback(digits/2)\\n\\nIn this case the second extension would be selected, because it is more specific.\\n\\n138 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cPattern-matching examples\\nBefore we go on, let\\'s look at a few more pattern-matching examples. In each one, see\\nif you can tell what the pattern would match before reading the explanation. We\\'ll start\\nwith an easy one:\\n_NXXXXXX\\n\\nThis pattern would match any seven-digit number, as long as the first digit was two or\\nhigher. This pattern would be compatible with any North American Numbering Plan\\nlocal seven-digit number. In areas with 10-digit dialing, that pattern would look like\\nthis:\\n_NXXNXXXXXX\\n\\nNote that neither of these two patterns would handle long distance calls. We\\'ll cover\\nthose shortly.\\n\\nThe NANP and Toll Fraud\\nThe North American Number Plan (NANP) is a shared telephone numbering scheme\\nused by 19 countries in North America and the Caribbean. Countries within NANP\\nshare country code 1.\\nIn the United States and Canada, telecom regulations are similar (and sensible) enough\\nthat you can place a long-distance call to most numbers in country code 1 and expect\\nto pay a reasonable toll. What many people don\\'t realize, however, is that 19 countries,\\nmany of which have very different telecom regulations, share the NANP. (More information can be found at http://www.nanpa.com.)\\nOne popular scam using the NANP tries to trick naive North Americans into calling\\nexpensive per-minute toll numbers in a Caribbean country; the callers believe that since\\nthey dialed 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX to reach the number, they\\'ll be paying their standard\\nnational long-distance rate for the call. Since the country in question may have regulations that allow for this form of extortion, the caller is ultimately held responsible for\\nthe call charges.\\nThe only way to prevent this sort of activity is to block calls to certain area codes (809,\\nfor example) and remove the restrictions only on an as-needed basis.\\n\\nLet\\'s try another:\\n\\nThis one is slightly more difficult. This would match the number 1, followed by an area\\ncode between 200 and 999, then any 7-digit number. In the NANP calling area, you\\nwould use this pattern to match any long-distance number.\\nNow for an even trickier example:\\n_011.\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 139\\n\\x0cIf that one left you scratching your head, look at it again. Did you notice the period on\\nthe end? This pattern matches any number that starts with 011 and has at least one\\nmore digit. In the NANP, this indicates an international phone number. (We\\'ll be using\\nthese patterns in the next section to add outbound dialing capabilities to our dialplan.)\\n\\nUsing the ${EXTEN} channel variable\\nWe know what you\\'re thinking... You\\'re sitting there asking yourself, \"So what happens\\nif I want to use pattern matching, but I need to know which digits were actually dialed?\"\\nLuckily, Asterisk has just the answer. Whenever you dial an extension, Asterisk sets\\nthe ${EXTEN} channel variable to the digits that were dialed. We can use an application\\ncalled SayDigits() to test it out:\\nexten => _XXX,1,SayDigits(${EXTEN})\\n\\nIn this example, the SayDigits() application will read back to you the three-digit extension you dialed.\\nOften, it\\'s useful to manipulate the ${EXTEN} by stripping a certain number of digits off\\nthe front of the extension. This is accomplished by using the syntax ${EXTEN:x}, where\\nx is where you want the returned string to start, from left to right. For example, if the\\nvalue of EXTEN is 95551212, ${EXTEN:1} equals 5551212. Let\\'s take a look at another\\nexample:\\nexten => _XXX,1,SayDigits(${EXTEN:1})\\n\\nIn this example, the SayDigits() application would start at the second digit, and thus\\nread back only the last two digits of the dialed extension.\\n\\nMore Advanced Digit Manipulation\\nThe ${EXTEN} variable properly has the syntax ${EXTEN:x:y}, where x is the starting\\nposition, and y is the number of digits to return. Given the following dial string:\\n\\nwe can extract the following digit strings using the ${EXTEN:x:y} construct:\\n${EXTEN:1:3} would contain 416.\\n${EXTEN:4:7} would contain 9671111.\\n${EXTEN:-4:4} would start four digits from the end, and return four digits, giving us\\n\\n1111.\\n If you grew up in North America, you may believe that the 1 you dial before a long distance call is \"the long\\n\\ndistance code.\" This is incorrect. The number 1 is in fact the international country code for all countries in\\nNANP. Keep this in mind if you ever send your phone number to someone in another country. They may\\nnot know what your country code is, and thus be unable to call you with just your area code and phone\\nnumber. Your full phone number with country code should be printed as +1 NPA NXX XXXX (where NPA\\nis your area code)e.g., +1 416 555 1212.\\n\\n140 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c${EXTEN:1} would give us everything after the first digit, 4169671111 (if the number of\\n\\ndigits to return is left blank, it will return the entire remaining string).\\nThis is a very powerful construct, but most of these variations are not very common in\\nnormal use. For the most part, you will be using ${EXTEN:1} to strip off your external\\naccess code.\\n\\nEnabling Outbound Dialing\\nNow that we\\'ve introduced pattern matching, we can go about the process of allowing\\nusers to make outbound calls. The first thing we\\'ll do is add a variable to the\\n[globals] context to define which channel will be used for outbound calls:\\n[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n\\nNext, we will add contexts to our dialplan for outbound dialing.\\nYou may be asking yourself at this point, \"Why do we need separate contexts for outbound calls?\" This is so that we can regulate and control which callers have permission\\nto make outbound calls, and which types of outbound calls they are allowed to make.\\nTo begin, let\\'s create a context for local calls. To be consistent with most traditional\\nphone switches, we\\'ll put a 9 on the front of our patterns, so that users have to dial 9\\nbefore calling an outside number:\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNote that dialing 9 doesn\\'t actually give you an outside line, unlike with\\nmany traditional PBX systems. Once you dial 9 on an analog line, the\\ndial tone will stop. If you\\'d like the dial tone to continue even after\\ndialing 9, add the following line (right after your context definition):\\nignorepat => 9\\n\\nThis directive tells Asterisk to continue to provide a dial tone on an\\nanalog line, even after the caller has dialed the indicated pattern. This\\nwill not work with VoIP telephones, as they usually don\\'t send digits to\\nthe system as they are input; they are sent to Asterisk all at once. Luckily,\\nmost of the popular VoIP telephones can be configured to emulate the\\nsame functionality.\\n\\nLet\\'s review what we\\'ve just done. We\\'ve added a global variable called OUTBOUND\\nTRUNK, which simply defines the channel we are using for outbound calls. We\\'ve also\\nadded a context for local outbound calls. In priority 1, we take the dialed extension,\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 141\\n\\x0cstrip off the 9 with the ${EXTEN:1} syntax, and then attempt to dial that number on the\\nchannel signified by the variable OUTBOUNDTRUNK. If the call is successful, the caller is\\nbridged with the outbound channel. If the call is unsuccessful (because either the channel is busy or the number can\\'t be dialed for some reason), the Congestion() application\\nis called, which plays a \"fast busy signal\" (congestion tone) to let the caller know that\\nthe call was unsuccessful.\\nBefore we go any further, let\\'s make sure our dialplan allows outbound emergency\\nnumbers:\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\nexten => 9911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911) ; So that folks who dial \"9\"\\n; first will also get through\\n\\nAgain, we\\'re assuming for the sake of these examples that we\\'re inside the United States\\nor Canada. If you\\'re outside of this area, please replace 911 with the emergency services\\nnumber in your particular location. This is something you never want to forget to put\\nin your dialplan!\\nNext, let\\'s add a context for long-distance calls:\\n[outbound-long-distance]\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Playtones(congestion)\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNow that we have these two new contexts, how do we allow internal users to take\\nadvantage of them? We need a way for contexts to be able to use the functionality\\ncontained in other contexts.\\n\\nIncludes\\nAsterisk has a feature that enables us to use the extensions from one context within\\nanother context via the include directive. This is used to control access to different\\nsections of the dialplan. We\\'ll use the include functionality to allow users in our\\n[employees] context the ability to make outbound phone calls. But first, let\\'s cover the\\nsyntax.\\nThe include statement takes the following form, where context is the name of the\\nremote context we want to include in the current context:\\ninclude => context\\n\\n The advantage of this is that if one day we decide to send all of our calls through some other channel, we\\n\\nhave to edit the channel name assigned to the variable OUTBOUNDTRUNK only in the [globals] context, instead\\nof having to manually edit every reference to the channel in our dialplan.\\n\\n142 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0cWhen we include other contexts within our current context, we have to be mindful of\\nthe order in which we are including them. Asterisk will first try to match the dialed\\nextension in the current context. If unsuccessful, it will then try the first included context (including any contexts included in that context), and then continue to the other\\nincluded contexts in the order in which they were included.\\nAs it sits, our current dialplan has two contexts for outbound calls, but there\\'s no way\\nfor people in the [employees] context to use them. Let\\'s remedy that by including the\\ntwo outbound contexts in the [employees] context, like this:\\n[globals]\\nJANE=SIP/Jane\\n[incoming]\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,n,Background(enter-ext-of-person)\\nexten => 123,n,WaitExten()\\nexten => 1,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 1,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 1,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 2,1,Dial(${JANE},10)\\nexten => 2,n,Playback(vm-nobodyavail)\\nexten => 2,n,Hangup()\\nexten => i,1,Playback(pbx-invalid)\\nexten => i,n,Goto(incoming,123,1)\\nexten => t,1,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => t,n,Hangup()\\n[employees]\\ninclude => outbound-local\\ninclude => outbound-long-distance\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\n[outbound-local]\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Congestion()\\nexten => _9NXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\nexten => 9911,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/911)\\n[outbound-long-distance]\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,1,Dial(${OUTBOUNDTRUNK}/${EXTEN:1})\\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Dialplan | 143\\n\\x0cexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Playtones(congestion)\\nexten => _91NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThese two include statements make it possible for callers in the [employees] context\\nto make outbound calls. We should also note that for security\\'s sake you should always\\nmake sure that your [inbound] context never allows outbound dialing. (If by chance it\\ndid, people could dial into your system and then make outbound toll calls that would\\nbe charged to you!)\\n\\nConclusion\\nAnd there you have it--a basic but functional dialplan. It\\'s not exactly fully featured,\\nbut we\\'ve covered all of the fundamentals. In the following chapters, we\\'ll continue to\\nadd features to this foundation.\\nIf parts of this dialplan don\\'t make sense, you may want to go back and re-read a section\\nor two before continuing on to the next chapter. It\\'s imperative that you understand\\nthese principles and how to apply them, as the next chapters build on this information.\\n\\n144 | Chapter 5: Dialplan Basics\\n\\x0c\\nMore Dialplan Concepts\\n\\nFor a list of all the ways technology has failed to improve\\nthe quality of life, please press three.\\n--Alice Kahn\\n\\nAlrighty. You\\'ve got the basics of dialplans down, but you know there\\'s more to come.\\nIf you don\\'t have the last chapter sorted out yet, please go back and give it another read.\\nWe\\'re about to get into more advanced topics.\\n\\nExpressions and Variable Manipulation\\nAs we begin our dive into the deeper aspects of dialplans, it is time to introduce you to\\na few tools that will greatly add to the power you can exercise in your dialplan. These\\nconstructs add incredible intelligence to your dialplan by enabling it to make decisions\\nbased on different criteria you want to define. Put on your thinking cap, and let\\'s get\\nstarted.\\n\\nBasic Expressions\\nExpressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that you string together to produce a result. An expression can test values, alter strings, or perform\\nmathematical calculations. Let\\'s say we have a variable called COUNT. In plain English,\\ntwo expressions using that variable might be \"COUNT plus 1\" and \"COUNT divided by 2.\"\\nEach of these expressions has a particular result or value, depending on the value of\\nthe given variable.\\nIn Asterisk, expressions always begin with a dollar sign and an opening square bracket\\nand end with a closing square bracket, as shown here:\\n$[expression]\\n\\nThus, we would write the above two examples like this:\\n$[${COUNT} + 1]\\n$[${COUNT} / 2]\\n\\n\\x0cWhen Asterisk encounters an expression in a dialplan, it replaces the entire expression\\nwith the resulting value. It is important to note that this takes place after variable substitution. To demonstrate, let\\'s look at the following code:*\\nexten => 321,1,Set(COUNT=3)\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=$[${COUNT} + 1])\\nexten => 321,n,SayNumber(${NEWCOUNT})\\n\\nIn the first priority, we assign the value of 3 to the variable named COUNT.\\nIn the second priority, only one application--Set()--is involved, but three things actually happen:\\n1. Asterisk substitutes ${COUNT} with the number 3 in the expression. The expression\\neffectively becomes this:\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=$[3 + 1])\\n\\n2. Asterisk evaluates the expression, adding 1 to 3, and replaces it with its computed\\nvalue of 4:\\nexten => 321,n,Set(NEWCOUNT=4)\\n\\n3. The value 4 is assigned to the NEWCOUNT variable by the Set() application.\\nThe third priority simply invokes the SayNumber() application, which speaks the current\\nvalue of the variable ${NEWCOUNT} (set to the value 4 in priority two).\\nTry it out in your own dialplan.\\n\\nOperators\\nWhen you create an Asterisk dialplan, you\\'re really writing code in a specialized scripting language. This means that the Asterisk dialplan--like any programming language\\n--recognizes symbols called operators that allow you to manipulate variables. Let\\'s\\nlook at the types of operators that are available in Asterisk:\\nBoolean operators\\nThese operators evaluate the \"truth\" of a statement. In computing terms, that essentially refers to whether the statement is something or nothing (nonzero or zero,\\ntrue or false, on or off, and so on). The Boolean operators are:\\n\\nThis operator (called the \"or\" operator, or \"pipe\") returns the evaluation of\\nexpr1 if it is true (neither an empty string nor zero). Otherwise, it returns the\\nevaluation of expr2.\\n\\n* Remember that when you reference a variable you can call it by its name, but when you refer to a variable\\'s\\n\\nvalue, you have to use the dollar sign and brackets around the variable name.\\n\\n146 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0c\\nThis operator (called \"and\") returns the evaluation of expr1 if both expressions\\nare true (i.e., neither expression evaluates to an empty string or zero). Otherwise, it returns zero.\\nexpr1 {=, >, >=, <, <=, !=} expr2\\n\\nThese operators return the results of an integer comparison if both arguments\\nare integers; otherwise, they return the results of a string comparison. The\\nresult of each comparison is 1 if the specified relation is true, or 0 if the relation\\nis false. (If you are doing string comparisons, they will be done in a manner\\nthat\\'s consistent with the current local settings of your operating system.)\\nMathematical operators\\nWant to perform a calculation? You\\'ll want one of these:\\n\\nThese operators return the results of the addition or subtraction of integervalued arguments.\\nexpr1 {*, /, %} expr2\\n\\nThese return, respectively, the results of the multiplication, integer division,\\nor remainder of integer-valued arguments.\\nRegular expression operator\\nYou can also use the regular expression operator in Asterisk:\\n\\nThis operator matches expr1 against expr2, where expr2 must be a regular\\nexpression. The regular expression is anchored to the beginning of the string\\nwith an implicit ^.\\nIf the match succeeds and the pattern contains at least one regular expression\\nsubexpression--\\\\( ... \\\\)--the string corresponding to \\\\1 is returned; otherwise, the matching operator returns the number of characters matched. If the\\nmatch fails and the pattern contains a regular expression subexpression, the\\nnull string is returned; otherwise, 0 is returned.\\nIn Asterisk version 1.0 the parser was quite simple, so it required that you put at least\\none space between the operator and any other values. Consequently, the following\\nmight not have worked as expected:\\nexten => 123,1,Set(TEST=$[2+1])\\n\\n For more on regular expressions, grab a copy of the ultimate reference, Jeffrey E.F. Friedl\\'s\\n\\nMastering Regular Expressions (O\\'Reilly) or visit http://www.regular-expressions.info.\\n If you don\\'t know what a ^ has to do with regular expressions, you simply must obtain a copy of\\n\\nMastering Regular Expressions. It will change your life!\\n\\nExpressions and Variable Manipulation | 147\\n\\x0cThis would have assigned the variable TEST to the string \"2+1\", instead of the value 3.\\nIn order to remedy that, we would put spaces around the operator like so:\\nexten => 234,1,Set(TEST=$[2 + 1])\\n\\nThis is no longer necessary in Asterisk 1.2 or 1.4 as the expression parser has been made\\nmore forgiving in these types of scenarios, however, for readability\\'s sake, we still recommend the spaces around your operators.\\nTo concatenate text onto the beginning or end of a variable, simply place them together\\nin an expression, like this:\\nexten => 234,1,Set(NEWTEST=$[blah${TEST}])\\n\\nDialplan Functions\\nDialplan functions allow you to add more power to your expressions; you can think of\\nthem as intelligent variables. Dialplan functions allow you to calculate string lengths,\\ndates and times, MD5 checksums, and so on, all from within a dialplan expression.\\n\\nSyntax\\nDialplan functions have the following basic syntax:\\nFUNCTION_NAME(argument)\\n\\nMuch like variables, you reference a function\\'s name as above, but you reference a\\nfunction\\'s value with the addition of a dollar sign, an opening curly brace, and a closing\\ncurly brace:\\n${FUNCTION_NAME(argument)}\\n\\nFunctions can also encapsulate other functions, like so:\\n${FUNCTION_NAME(${FUNCTION_NAME(argument)})}\\n^\\n^ ^\\n^\\n^^^^\\n\\nAs you\\'ve probably already figured out, you must be very careful about making sure\\nyou have matching parentheses and braces. In the above example, we have labeled the\\nopening parentheses and curly braces with numbers and their corresponding closing\\ncounterparts with the same numbers.\\n\\nExamples of Dialplan Functions\\nFunctions are often used in conjunction with the Set() application to either get or set\\nthe value of a variable. As a simple example, let\\'s look at the LEN() function. This\\nfunction calculates the string length of its argument. Let\\'s calculate the string length of\\na variable and read back the length to the caller:\\n\\n148 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 123,1,Set(TEST=example)\\nexten => 123,n,SayNumber(${LEN(${TEST})})\\n\\nThe above example would evaluate the string example as having seven characters, assign\\nthe number of characters to the variable length, and then speak the number to the user\\nwith the SayNumber() application.\\nLet\\'s look at another simple example. If we wanted to set one of the various channel\\ntimeouts, we could use the TIMEOUT() function. The TIMEOUT() function accepts one of\\nthree arguments: absolute, digit, and response. To set the digit timeout with the\\nTIMEOUT() function, we could use the Set() application, like so:\\nexten => s,1,Set(TIMEOUT(digit)=30)\\n\\nNotice the lack of ${ } surrounding the function. Just as if we were assigning a value\\nto a variable, we assign a value to a function without the use of the ${ } encapsulation.\\nA complete list of available functions can be found by typing core show functions at\\nthe Asterisk command-line interface. You can also look them up in Appendix F.\\n\\nConditional Branching\\nNow that you\\'ve learned a bit about expressions and functions, it\\'s time to put them\\nto use. By using expressions and functions, you can add even more advanced logic to\\nyour dialplan. To allow your dialplan to make decisions, you\\'ll use\\nconditional branching. Let\\'s take a closer look.\\n\\nThe GotoIf() Application\\nThe key to conditional branching is the GotoIf() application. GotoIf() evaluates an\\nexpression and sends the caller to a specific destination based on whether the expression evaluates to true or false.\\nGotoIf() uses a special syntax, often called the conditional syntax:\\n\\nIf the expression evaluates to true, the caller is sent to destination1. If the expression\\nevaluates to false, the caller is sent to the second destination. So, what is true and what\\nis false? An empty string and the number 0 evaluate as false. Anything else evaluates as\\ntrue.\\nThe destinations can each be one of the following:\\n A priority label within the same extension, such as weasels\\n An extension and a priority label within the same context, such as 123,weasels\\n A context, extension, and priority label, such as incoming,123,weasels\\n\\nConditional Branching | 149\\n\\x0cEither of the destinations may be omitted, but not both. If the omitted destination is\\nto be followed, Asterisk simply goes on to the next priority in the current extension.\\nLet\\'s use GotoIf() in an example:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nYou will notice that we have used the Hangup() application following\\neach Playback() application. This is done so that when we jump to the\\nweasels label, the call stops before execution gets to the officeiguanas sound file. It is becoming increasingly common to see extensions broken up in to multiple components (protected from each other\\nby the Hangup() command), each one acting as steps executed following\\na GotoIf().\\n\\nProviding Only a False Conditional Path\\nIf we wanted to, we could have crafted the preceding example like this:\\nexten\\nexten\\n; but\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=> 345,n,GotoIf($[${TEST} = 1]?:iguanas) ; we don\\'t have the weasels label anymore,\\nthis will still work\\n\\nThere is nothing between the ? and the :, so if the statement evaluates to true, execution\\nof the dialplan will continue at the next step. Since that is what we want, a label is not\\nneeded.\\nWe don\\'t really recommend doing this, because this is hard to read, but you will see\\ndialplans like this, so it\\'s good to be aware that this syntax is totally correct.\\n\\nTypically when you have this type of layout where you end up wanting to limit Asterisk\\nfrom falling through to the next priority after you\\'ve performed that jump, it\\'s probably\\nbetter to jump to separate extensions instead of priority labels. If anything, it makes it\\na bit more clear when reading the dialplan. We could rewrite the previous bit of dialplan\\nlike this:\\nexten => 345,1,Set(TEST=1)\\nexten => 345,n,GotoIf($[${TEST} = 1]?weasels,1:iguanas,1); now we\\'re going to\\n; extension,priority\\nexten => weasels,1,Playback(weasels-eaten-phonesys); this is NOT a label.\\n; It is a different extension\\nexten => weasels,n,Hangup()\\n\\n150 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => iguanas,1,Playback(office-iguanas)\\nexten => iguanas,n,Hangup()\\n\\nBy changing the value assigned to TEST in the first line, you should be able to have your\\nAsterisk server play a different greeting.\\nLet\\'s look at another example of conditional branching. This time, we\\'ll use both\\nGoto() and GotoIf() to count down from 10 and then hang up:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s analyze this example. In the first priority, we set the variable COUNT to 10. Next,\\nwe check to see if COUNT is greater than 0. If it is, we move on to the next priority. (Don\\'t\\nforget that if we omit a destination in the GotoIf() application, control goes to the next\\npriority.) From there we speak the number, subtract 1 from COUNT, and go back to\\npriority label start. If COUNT is less than or equal to 0, control goes to priority label\\ngoodbye, and the call is hung up.\\nThe classic example of conditional branching is affectionately known as the anti-girlfriend logic. If the Caller ID number of the incoming call matches the phone number\\nof the recipient\\'s ex-girlfriend, Asterisk gives a different message than it ordinarily\\nwould to any other caller. While somewhat simple and primitive, it\\'s a good example\\nfor learning about conditional branching within the Asterisk dialplan.\\nThis example uses the CALLERID function, which allows us to retrieve the Caller ID\\ninformation on the inbound call. Let\\'s assume for the sake of this example that the\\nvictim\\'s phone number is 888-555-1212:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nIn priority 1, we call the GotoIf() application. It tells Asterisk to go to priority label\\nreject if the Caller ID number matches 8885551212, and otherwise to go to priority label\\nallow (we could have simply omitted the label name, causing the GotoIf() to fall\\nthrough). If the Caller ID number matches, control of the call goes to priority label\\nreject, which plays back an uninspiring message to the undesired caller. Otherwise,\\nthe call attempts to dial the recipient on channel Zap/4.\\n\\nTime-Based Conditional Branching with GotoIfTime()\\nAnother way to use conditional branching in your dialplan is with the GotoIfTime()\\napplication. Whereas GotoIf() evaluates an expression to decide what to do, GotoIf\\nConditional Branching | 151\\n\\x0cTime() looks at the current system time and uses that to decide whether or not to follow\\n\\na different branch in the dialplan.\\nThe most obvious use of this application is to give your callers a different greeting before\\nand after normal business hours.\\nThe syntax for the GotoIfTime() application looks like this:\\nGotoIfTime(times,days_of_week,days_of_month,months?label)\\n\\nIn short, GotoIfTime() sends the call to the specified label if the current date and time\\nmatch the criteria specified by times, days_of_week, days_of_month, and months. Let\\'s\\nlook at each argument in more detail:\\ntimes\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more time ranges, in a 24-hour format. As an example, 9:00\\nA.M. through 5:00 P.M. would be specified as 09:00-17:00. The day starts at 0:00\\nand ends at 23:59.\\nIt is worth noting that times will properly wrap around. So if you\\nwish to specify the times your office is closed, you might write\\n18:00-9:00 in the times parameter, and it will perform as expected.\\nNote that this technique works as well for the other components\\nof GotoIfTime. For example, you can write sat-sun to specify the\\nweekend days.\\n\\ndays_of_week\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more days of the week. The days should be specified as mon,\\ntue, wed, thu, fri, sat, and/or sun. Monday through Friday would be expressed as\\nmon-fri. Tuesday and Thursday would be expressed as tue&thu.\\nNote that you can specify a combination of ranges and single days,\\nas in: sun-mon&wed&fri-sat, or, more simply: wed&fri-mon.\\n\\ndays_of_month\\n\\nThis is a list of the numerical days of the month. Days are specified by the numbers\\n1 through 31. The 7th through the 12th would be expressed as 7-12, and the 15th\\nand 30th of the month would be written as 15&30.\\nmonths\\n\\nThis is a list of one or more months of the year. The months should be written as\\njan-apr for a range, and separated with ampersands when wanting to include nonsequencial months, such as jan&mar&jun. You can also combine them like so:\\njan-apr&jun&oct-dec.\\n\\n152 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cIf you wish to match on all possible values for any of these arguments, simply put an\\n* in for that argument.\\nThe label argument can be any of the following:\\n A priority label within the same extension, such as time_has_passed\\n An extension and a priority within the same context, such as 123,time_has_passed\\n A context, extension, and priority, such as incoming,123,time_has_passed\\nNow that we\\'ve covered the syntax, let\\'s look at a couple of examples. The following\\nexample would match from 9:00 A.M. to 5:59 P.M., on Monday through Friday, on\\nany day of the month, in any month of the year:\\nexten => s,1,GotoIfTime(09:00-17:59,mon-fri,*,*?open,s,1)\\n\\nIf the caller calls during these hours, the call will be sent to the first priority of the s\\nextension in the context named open. If the call is made outside of the specified times,\\nit will be sent to the next priority of the current extension. This allows you to easily\\nbranch on multiple times, as shown in the next example (note that you should always\\nput your most specific time matches before the least specific ones):\\n; If it\\'s any hour of the day, on any day of the week,\\n; during the fourth day of the month, in the month of July,\\n; we\\'re closed\\nexten => s,1,GotoIfTime(*,*,4,jul?open,s,1)\\n; During business hours, send calls to the open context\\nexten => s,n,GotoIfTime(09:00-17:59|mon-fri|*|*?open,s,1)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIfTime(09:00-11:59|sat|*|*?open,s,1)\\n; Otherwise, we\\'re closed\\nexten => s,n,Goto(closed,s,1)\\n\\nIf you run into the situation where you ask the question, \"But I specified\\n17:58 and it\\'s now 17:59. Why is it still doing the same thing?\" it should\\nbe noted that the granularity of the GotoIfTime() application is only to\\na two-minute period. So if you specify 18:00 as the ending time of a\\nperiod, the system will continue to perform the same way for an additional minute, until 18:01:59.\\n\\nVoicemail\\nOne of the most popular (or, arguably, unpopular) features of any modern telephone\\nsystem is voicemail. Naturally, Asterisk has a reasonably flexible voicemail system.\\nSome of the features of Asterisk\\'s voicemail system include:\\n Unlimited password-protected voicemail boxes, each containing mailbox folders\\nfor organizing voicemail\\n Different greetings for busy and unavailable states\\nVoicemail | 153\\n\\x0c Default and custom greetings\\n The ability to associate phones with more than one mailbox and mailboxes with\\nmore than one phone\\n Email notification of voicemail, with the voicemail optionally attached as a sound\\nfile\\n Voicemail forwarding and broadcasts\\n Message-waiting indicator (flashing light or stuttered dial tone) on many types of\\nphones\\n Company directory of employees, based on voicemail boxes\\nAnd that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg! In this section, we\\'ll introduce you to the fundamentals of a typical voicemail setup.\\nThe voicemail configuration is defined in the configuration file called voicemail.conf.\\nThis file contains an assortment of settings that you can use to customize the voicemail\\nsystem to your needs. Covering all of the available options in voicemail.conf would be\\nbeyond the scope of this chapter, but the sample configuration file is well documented\\nand quite easy to follow. For now, look near the bottom of the file, where voicemail\\ncontexts and voicemail boxes are defined.\\nJust as dialplan contexts keep different parts of your dialplan separate, voicemail contexts allow you to define different sets of mailboxes that are separate from one another.\\nThis allows you to host voicemail for several different companies or offices on the same\\nserver. Voicemail contexts are defined in the same way as dialplan contexts, with square\\nbrackets surrounding the name of the context. For our examples, we\\'ll be using the\\n[default] voicemail context.\\n\\nCreating Mailboxes\\nInside each voicemail context, we define different mailboxes. The syntax for defining\\na mailbox is:\\nmailbox => password,name[,email[,pager_email[,options]]]\\n\\nLet\\'s explain what each part of the mailbox definition does:\\nmailbox\\n\\nThis is the mailbox number. It usually corresponds with the extension number of\\nthe associated set.\\npassword\\n\\nThis is the numeric password that the mailbox owner will use to access her voicemail. If the user changes her password, the system will update this field in the\\nvoicemail.conf file.\\n\\n No, you really don\\'t have to pay for this--and yes, it really does work.\\n\\n154 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cname\\n\\nThis is the name of the mailbox owner. The company directory uses the text in this\\nfield to allow callers to spell usernames.\\nemail\\n\\nThis is the email address of the mailbox owner. Asterisk can send voicemail notifications (including the voicemail message itself) to the specified email box.\\npager_email\\n\\nThis is the email address of the mailbox owner\\'s pager or cell phone. Asterisk can\\nsend a short voicemail notification message to the specified email address.\\noptions\\n\\nThis field is a list of options that sets the mailbox owner\\'s time zone and overrides\\nthe global voicemail settings. There are nine valid options: attach, serveremail, tz,\\nsaycid, review, operator, callback, dialout, and exitcontext. These options\\nshould be in option = value pairs, separated by the pipe character (|). The tz option sets the user\\'s time zone to a time zone previously defined in the [zonemes\\nsages] section of voicemail.conf, and the other eight options override the global\\nvoicemail settings with the same names.\\nA typical mailbox definition might look something like this:\\ntz=central|attach=yes\\n\\nContinuing with our dialplan from the last chapter, let\\'s set up voicemail boxes for\\nJohn and Jane. We\\'ll give John a password of 1234 and Jane a password of 4444 (remember, these go in voicemail.conf, not in extensions.conf):\\n[default]\\n\\nAdding Voicemail to the Dialplan\\nNow that we\\'ve created mailboxes for Jane and John, let\\'s allow callers to leave messages for them if they don\\'t answer the phone. To do this, we\\'ll use the VoiceMail()\\napplication.\\nThe VoiceMail() application sends the caller to the specified mailbox, so that he can\\nleave a message. The mailbox should be specified as mailbox @ context, where context is the name of the voicemail context. The option letters b or u can be added to\\nrequest the type of greeting. If the letter b is used, the caller will hear the mailbox owner\\'s\\nbusy message. If the letter u is used, the caller will hear the mailbox owner\\'s\\nunavailable message (if one exists).\\nLet\\'s use this in our sample dialplan. Previously, we had a line like this in our\\n[internal] context, which allowed us to call John:\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN})\\n\\nVoicemail | 155\\n\\x0cNext, let\\'s add an unavailable message that the caller will be played if John doesn\\'t\\nanswer the phone within 10 seconds. Remember, the second argument to the Dial()\\napplication is a timeout. If the call is not answered before the timeout expires, the call\\nis sent to the next priority. Let\\'s add a 10-second timeout, and a priority to send the\\ncaller to voicemail if John doesn\\'t answer in time:\\nexten => 101,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => 101,n,VoiceMail(101@default,u)\\n\\nNow, let\\'s change it so that if John is busy (on another call), it\\'ll send us to his voicemail,\\nwhere we\\'ll hear his busy message. To do this, we will make use of the ${DIALSTATUS}\\nvariable which contains one of several status values (see core show application dial\\nat the Asterisk console for a listing of all the possible values):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n101,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\n\\nNow callers will get John\\'s voicemail (with the appropriate greeting) if John is either\\nbusy or unavailable. A slight problem remains, however, in that John has no way of\\nretrieving his messages. Let\\'s remedy that.\\n\\nAccessing Voicemail\\nUsers can retrieve their voicemail messages, change their voicemail options, and record\\ntheir voicemail greetings by using the VoiceMailMain() application. In its typical form,\\nVoiceMailMain() is called without any arguments. Let\\'s add extension 700 to the\\n[internal] context of our dialplan so that internal users can dial it to access their voicemail messages:\\nexten => 700,1,VoiceMailMain()\\n\\nCreating a Dial-by-Name Directory\\nOne last feature of the Asterisk voicemail system we should cover is the dial-by-name\\ndirectory. This is created with the Directory() application. This application uses the\\nnames defined in the mailboxes in voicemail.conf to present the caller with a dial-byname directory of the users.\\nDirectory() takes up to three arguments: the voicemail context from which to read the\\n\\nnames, the optional dialplan context in which to dial the user, and an option string\\n(which is also optional). By default, Directory() searches for the user by last name, but\\npassing the f option forces it to search by first name instead. Let\\'s add two dial-byname directories to the [incoming] context of our sample dialplan, so that callers can\\nsearch by either first or last name:\\n\\n156 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 8,1,Directory(default,incoming,f)\\nexten => 9,1,Directory(default,incoming)\\n\\nIf callers press 8, they\\'ll get a directory by first name. If they dial 9, they\\'ll get the\\ndirectory by last name.\\n\\nMacros\\nMacros are a very useful construct designed to avoid repetition in the dialplan. They\\nalso help in making changes to the dialplan. To illustrate this point, let\\'s look at our\\nsample dialplan again. If you remember the changes we made for voicemail, we ended\\nup with the following for John\\'s extension:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n101,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\n\\nNow imagine you have a hundred users on your Asterisk system--setting up the extensions would involve a lot of copying and pasting. Then imagine that you need to\\nmake a change to the way your extensions work. That would involve a lot of editing,\\nand you\\'d be almost certain to have errors.\\nInstead, you can define a macro that contains a list of steps to take, and then have all\\nof the phone extensions refer to that macro. All you need to change is the macro, and\\neverything in the dialplan that references that macro will change as well.\\nIf you\\'re familiar with computer programming, you\\'ll recognize that\\nmacros are similar to subroutines in many modern programming languages. If you\\'re not familiar with computer programming, don\\'t worry\\n--we\\'ll walk you through creating a macro.\\n\\nThe best way to appreciate macros is to see one in action, so let\\'s move right along.\\n\\n Although Macro seems like a general-purpose dialplan subroutine, it has a stack overflow problem that means\\n\\nyou should not try to nest Macro calls more than five levels deep. As of this writing, we do not know whether\\nthe Macro application will be patched for 1.4, or if it will be rewritten for future versions. If you plan to do a\\nlot of macros within macros (and call complex functions within them), you may run into stability problems.\\nYou will know you have a problem with just one test call, so if your dialplan tests out, you\\'re good to go. We\\nalso recommend that you take a look at the Gosub and Return applications, as a lot of macro functionality can\\nbe implemented without actually using Macro(). Also, please note that we are not suggesting that you don\\'t\\nuse Macro(). It is fantastic and works very well; it just doesn\\'t nest efficiently.\\n\\nMacros | 157\\n\\x0cDefining Macros\\nLet\\'s take the dialplan logic we used above to set up voicemail for John and turn it into\\na macro. Then we\\'ll use the macro to give John and Jane (and the rest of their coworkers)\\nthe same functionality.\\nMacro definitions look a lot like contexts. (In fact, you could argue that they really are\\nsmall, limited contexts.) You define a macro by placing macro- and the name of your\\nmacro in square brackets, like this:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\n\\nMacro names must start with macro-. This distinguishes them from regular contexts.\\nThe commands within the macro are built almost identically to anything else in the\\ndialplan; the only limiting factor is that macros use only the s extension. Let\\'s add our\\nvoicemail logic to the macro, changing the extension to s as we go:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(101@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(101@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nThat\\'s a start, but it\\'s not perfect, as it\\'s still specific to John and his mailbox number.\\nTo make the macro generic so that it will work not only for John but also for all of his\\ncoworkers, we\\'ll take advantage of another property of macros: arguments. But first,\\nlet\\'s see how we call macros in our dialplan.\\n\\nCalling Macros from the Dialplan\\nTo use a macro in our dialplan, we use the Macro() application. This application calls\\nthe specified macro and passes it any arguments. For example, to call our voicemail\\nmacro from our dialplan, we can do the following:\\nexten => 101,1,Macro(voicemail)\\n\\nThe Macro() application also defines several special variables for our use. They include:\\n${MACRO_CONTEXT}\\n\\nThe original context in which the macro was called.\\n${MACRO_EXTEN}\\n\\nThe original extension in which the macro was called.\\n${MACRO_PRIORITY}\\n\\nThe original priority in which the macro was called.\\n${ARG n }\\nThe nth argument passed to the macro. For example, the first argument would be\\n${ARG1}, the second ${ARG2}, and so on.\\n\\n158 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cAs we explained earlier, the way we initially defined our macro was hardcoded for John,\\ninstead of being generic. Let\\'s change our macro to use ${MACRO_EXTEN} instead of 101\\nfor the mailbox number. That way, if we call the macro from extension 101 the voicemail messages will go to mailbox 101, and if we call the macro from extension 102\\nmessages will go to mailbox 102, and so on:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${JOHN},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN}@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(${MACRO_EXTEN}@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nUsing Arguments in Macros\\nOkay, now we\\'re getting closer to having the macro the way we want it, but we still\\nhave one thing left to change; we need to pass in the channel to dial, as it\\'s currently\\nstill hardcoded for ${JOHN} (remember that we defined the variable JOHN as the channel\\nto call when we want to reach John). Let\\'s pass in the channel as an argument, and\\nthen our first macro will be complete:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${ARG1},10)\\nexten => s,n,GotoIf($[\"${DIALSTATUS}\" = \"BUSY\"]?busy:unavail)\\nexten => s,n(unavail),Voicemail(${MCARO_EXTEN}@default,u)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\nexten => s,n(busy),VoiceMail(${MCARO_EXTEN}@default,b)\\nexten => s,n,Hangup()\\n\\nNow that our macro is done, we can use it in our dialplan. Here\\'s how we can call our\\nmacro to provide voicemail to John, Jane, and Jack:\\nexten => 101,1,Macro(voicemail,${JOHN})\\nexten => 102,1,Macro(voicemail,${JANE})\\nexten => 103,1,Macro(voicemail,${JACK})\\n\\nWith 50 or more users, this dialplan will still look neat and organized; we\\'ll simply\\nhave one line per user, referencing a macro that can be as complicated as required. We\\ncould even have a few different macros for various user types, such as executives,\\ncourtesy_phones, call_center_agents, analog_sets, sales_department, and so on.\\nA more advanced version of the macro might look something like this:\\n[macro-voicemail]\\nexten => s,1,Dial(${ARG1},20)\\nexten => s,n,Goto(s-${DIALSTATUS},1)\\nexten => s-NOANSWER,1,Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN},u)\\nexten => s-NOANSWER,n,Goto(incoming,s,1)\\nexten => s-BUSY,1,Voicemail(${MACRO_EXTEN},b)\\nexten => s-BUSY,n,Goto(incoming,s,1)\\nexten => _s-.,1,Goto(s-NOANSWER,1)\\n\\nMacros | 159\\n\\x0cThis macro depends on a nice side effect of the Dial() application: when you use the\\nDial() application, it sets the DIALSTATUS variable to indicate whether the call was successful or not. In this case, we\\'re handling the NOANSWER and BUSY cases, and treating all\\nother result codes as a NOANSWER.\\n\\nUsing the Asterisk Database (AstDB)\\nHaving fun yet? It gets even better!\\nAsterisk provides a powerful mechanism for storing values called the Asterisk database\\n(AstDB). The AstDB provides a simple way to store data for use within your dialplan.\\nFor those of you with experience using relational databases such as\\nPostgreSQL or MySQL, the Asterisk database is not a traditional relational database. It is a Berkeley DB Version 1 database. There are several\\nways to store data from Asterisk in a relational database. Check out\\nChapter 12 for a more about relational databases.\\n\\nThe Asterisk database stores its data in groupings called families, with values identified\\nby keys. Within a family, a key may be used only once. For example, if we had a family\\ncalled test, we could store only one value with a key called count. Each stored value\\nmust be associated with a family.\\n\\nStoring Data in the AstDB\\nTo store a new value in the Asterisk database, we use the Set() application,# but instead\\nof using it to set a channel variable, we use it to set an AstDB variable. For example, to\\nassign the count key in the test family with the value of 1, write the following:\\nexten => 456,1,Set(DB(test/count)=1)\\n\\nIf a key named count already exists in the test family, its value will be overwritten with\\nthe new value. You can also store values from the Asterisk command line, by running\\nthe command database put family key value. For our example, you would type data\\nbase put test count 1.\\n\\nRetrieving Data from the AstDB\\nTo retrieve a value from the Asterisk database and assign it to a variable, we use the\\nSet() application again. Let\\'s retrieve the value of count (again, from the test family),\\nassign it to a variable called COUNT, and then speak the value to the caller:\\n# Previous versions of Asterisk had applications called DBput() and DBget() that were used to set values in and\\n\\nretrieve values from the AstDB. If you\\'re using an old version of Asterisk, you\\'ll want to use those applications\\ninstead.\\n\\n160 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cexten => 456,1,Set(DB(test/count)=1)\\nexten => 456,n,Set(COUNT=${DB(test/count)})\\nexten => 456,n,SayNumber(${COUNT})\\n\\nYou may also check the value of a given key from the Asterisk command line by running\\nthe command database get family key. To view the entire contents of the AstDB, use\\nthe database show command.\\n\\nDeleting Data from the AstDB\\nThere are two ways to delete data from the Asterisk database. To delete a key, you can\\nuse the DB_DELETE() application. It takes the path to the key as its arguments, like this:\\n; deletes the key and returns its value in one step\\nexten => 457,1,Verbose(0, The value was ${DB_DELETE(test/count)})\\n\\nYou can also delete an entire key family by using the DBdeltree() application. The\\nDBdeltree() application takes a single argumentthe name of the key familyto delete.\\nTo delete the entire test family, do the following:\\nexten => 457,1,DBdeltree(test)\\n\\nTo delete keys and key families from the AstDB via the command-line interface, use\\nthe database del key and database deltree family commands, respectively.\\n\\nUsing the AstDB in the Dialplan\\nThere are an infinite number of ways to use the Asterisk database in a dialplan. To\\nintroduce the AstDB, we\\'ll show two simple examples. The first is a simple counting\\nexample to show that the Asterisk database is persistent (meaning that it survives system reboots). In the second example, we\\'ll use the BLACKLIST() function to evaluate\\nwhether or not a number is on the blacklist and should be blocked.\\nTo begin the counting example, let\\'s first retrieve a number (the value of the count key)\\nfrom the database and assign it to a variable named COUNT. If the key doesn\\'t exist, DB\\n() will return NULL (no value). In order to verify if a value exists in the database or\\nnot, we will introduce the ISNULL() function that will verify whether a value was returned, and if not, we will initialize the AstDB with the Set() application, where we\\nwill set the value in the database to 1. The next priority will send us back to priority 1.\\nThis will happen the very first time we dial this extension:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll say the current value of COUNT, and then increment COUNT:\\nexten => 678,1,Set(COUNT=${DB(test/count)})\\nexten => 678,n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${COUNT})}]?:continue)\\n\\nUsing the Asterisk Database (AstDB) | 161\\n\\x0cexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve incremented COUNT, let\\'s put the new value back into the database.\\nRemember that storing a value for an existing key overwrites the previous value:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll loop back to the first priority. This way, the application will continue\\ncounting:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nGo ahead and try this example. Listen to it count for a while, and then hang up. When\\nyou dial this extension again, it should continue counting from where it left off. The\\nvalue stored in the database will be persistent, even across a restart of Asterisk.\\nIn the next example, we\\'ll create dialplan logic around the BLACKLIST() function, which\\nchecks to see if the current Caller ID number exists in the blacklist. (The blacklist is\\nsimply a family called blacklist in the AstDB.) If BLACKLIST() finds the number in the\\nblacklist, it returns the value 1, otherwise it will return 0. We can use these values in\\ncombination with a GotoIf() to control whether the call will execute the Dial()\\napplication:\\nexten => 124,1,GotoIf($[${BLACKLIST()]?blocked,1)\\nexten => 124,n,Dial(${JOHN})\\nexten => blocked,1,Playback(privacy-you-are-blacklisted)\\nexten => blocked,n,Playback(vm-goodbye)\\nexten => blocked,n,Hangup()\\n\\nTo add a number to the blacklist, run the database put blacklist number 1 command\\nfrom the Asterisk command-line interface.\\n\\n162 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cHandy Asterisk Features\\nNow that we\\'ve gone over some more of the basics, let\\'s look at a few popular functions\\nthat have been incorporated into Asterisk.\\n\\nZapateller()\\nZapateller() is a simple Asterisk application that plays a special information tone at\\n\\nthe beginning of a call, which causes auto-dialers (usually used by telemarketers) to\\nthink that the line has been disconnected. Not only will they hang up, but their systems\\nwill flag your number as out of service, which could help you avoid all kinds of telemarketing calls. To use this functionality within your dialplan, simply call the\\nZapateller() application.\\nWe\\'ll also use the optional nocallerid option so that the tone will be played only when\\nthere is no Caller ID information on the incoming call. For example, you might use\\nZapateller() in the s extension of your [incoming] context, like this:\\n[incomimg]\\nexten => s,1,Zapateller(nocallerid)\\nexten => s,n,Playback(enter-ext-of-person)\\n\\nCall Parking\\nAnother handy feature is called call parking. Call parking allows you to place a call on\\nhold in a \"parking lot,\" so that it can be taken off hold from another extension. Parameters for call parking (such as the extensions to use, the number of spaces, and so\\non) are all controlled within the features.conf configuration file. The [general] section\\nof the features.conf file contains four settings related to call parking:\\nparkext\\n\\nThis is the parking lot extension. Transfer a call to this extension, and the system\\nwill tell you which parking position the call is in. By default, the parking extension\\nis 700.\\nparkpos\\n\\nThis option defines the number of parking slots. For example, setting it to\\n701-720 creates 20 parking positions, numbered 701 through 720.\\ncontext\\n\\nThis is the name of the parking context. To be able to park calls, you must include\\nthis context.\\nparkingtime\\n\\nIf set, this option controls how long (in seconds) a call can stay in the parking lot.\\nIf the call isn\\'t picked up within the specified time, the extension that parked the\\ncall will be called back.\\n\\nHandy Asterisk Features | 163\\n\\x0cYou must restart Asterisk after editing features.conf, as the file is read\\nonly on startup. Running the reload command will not cause the\\nfeatures.conf file to be read.\\n\\nAlso note that because the user needs to be able to transfer the calls to the parking lot\\nextension, you should make sure you\\'re using the t and/or T options to the Dial()\\napplication.\\nSo, let\\'s create a simple dialplan to show off call parking:\\n[incoming]\\ninclude => parkedcalls\\nexten => 103,1,Dial(SIP/Bob,,tT)\\nexten => 104,1,Dial(SIP/Charlie,,tT)\\n\\nTo illustrate how call parking works, say that Alice calls into the system and dials\\nextension 103 to reach Bob. After a while, Bob transfers the call to extension 700, which\\ntells him that the call from Alice has been parked in position 701. Bob then dials Charlie\\nat extension 104, and tells him that Alice is at extension 701. Charlie then dials extension 701 and begins to talk to Alice. This is a simple and effective way of allowing callers\\nto be transferred between users.\\nThe t and T arguments to Dial() are not needed on all channel types.\\nFor example, many SIP phones implement this via a softkey or hardkey\\nand utilize SIP signaling.\\n\\nConferencing with MeetMe()\\nLast but not least, let\\'s cover setting up an audio conference bridge with the MeetMe()\\napplication.* This application allows multiple callers to converse together, as if they\\nwere all in the same physical location. Some of the main features include:\\n The ability to create password-protected conferences\\n Conference administration (mute conference, lock conference, kick participants)\\n The option of muting all but one participant (useful for company announcements,\\nbroadcasts, etc.)\\n Static or dynamic conference creation\\nLet\\'s walk through setting up a basic conference room. The configuration options for\\nthe MeetMe conferencing system are found in meetme.conf. Inside the configuration\\nfile, you define conference rooms and optional numeric passwords. (If a password is\\n* In the world of legacy PBXes, this type of functionality is very expensive. Either you have to pay big bucks\\n\\nfor a dial-in service, or you have to add an expensive conferencing bridge to your proprietary PBX.\\n\\n164 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0cdefined here, it will be required to enter all conferences using that room.) For our\\nexample, let\\'s set up a conference room at extension 600. First, we\\'ll set up the conference room in meetme.conf. We\\'ll call it 600, and we won\\'t assign a password at this\\ntime:\\n[rooms]\\nconf => 600\\n\\nNow that the configuration file is complete, we\\'ll need to restart Asterisk so that it can\\nreread the meetme.conf file. Next, we\\'ll add support for the conference room to our\\ndialplan with the MeetMe() application. MeetMe() takes three arguments: the name of\\nthe conference room (as defined in meetme.conf), a set of options, and the password\\nthe user must enter to join this conference. Let\\'s set up a simple conference using room\\n600, the i option (which announces when people enter and exit the conference), and a\\npassword of 54321:\\nexten => 600,1,MeetMe(600,i,54321)\\n\\nThat\\'s all there is to it! When callers enter extension 600, they will be prompted for the\\npassword. If they correctly enter 54321, they will be added to the conference. See Appendix B for a list of all the options supported by the MeetMe() application.\\nAnother useful application is MeetMeCount(). As its name suggests, this application\\ncounts the number of users in a particular conference room. It takes up to two\\narguments: the conference room in which to count the number of participants, and\\noptionally a variable name to assign the count to. If the variable name is not passed as\\nthe second argument, the count is read to the caller:\\nexten => 601,1,Playback(conf-thereare)\\nexten => 601,n,MeetMeCount(600)\\nexten => 601,n,Playback(conf-peopleinconf)\\n\\nIf you pass a variable as the second argument to MeetMeCount(), the count is assigned\\nto the variable, and playback of the count is skipped. You might use this to limit the\\nnumber of participants, like this:\\n; limit the conference room to 10 participants\\nexten => 600,1,MeetMeCount(600,CONFCOUNT)\\nexten => 600,n,GotoIf($[${CONFCOUNT} <= 10]?meetme:conf_full,1)\\nexten => 600,n(meetme),MeetMe(600,i,54321)\\nexten => conf_full,1,Playback(conf-full)\\n\\nIsn\\'t Asterisk fun?\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ve covered a few more of the many applications in the Asterisk\\ndialplan, and hopefully we\\'ve given you the seeds from which you can explore the\\ncreation of your own dialplans. As with the previous chapter, we invite you to go back\\nand reread any sections that require clarification.\\nConclusion | 165\\n\\x0cThe following chapters take us away from Asterisk for a bit, in order to talk about some\\nof the technologies that all telephone systems use. We\\'ll be referring to Asterisk a lot,\\nbut much of what we want to discuss are things that are common to many telecom\\nsystems.\\n\\n166 | Chapter 6: More Dialplan Concepts\\n\\x0c\\nUnderstanding Telephony\\n\\nUtility is when you have one telephone, luxury is when\\nyou have two, opulence is when you have three--and\\nparadise is when you have none.\\n--Doug Larson\\n\\nWe\\'re now going to take a break from Asterisk for a chapter or two, because we want\\nto spend some time discussing the technologies with which your Asterisk system will\\nneed to interface. In this chapter, we are going to talk about some of the technologies\\nof the traditional telephone network--especially those that people most commonly\\nwant to connect to Asterisk. (We\\'ll discuss Voice over IP in the next chapter.)\\nWhile tomes could be written about the technologies in use in telecom networks, the\\nmaterial in this chapter was chosen based on our experiences in the community, which\\nhelped us to define the specific items that might be most useful. Although this knowledge may not be strictly required in order to configure your Asterisk system, it will be\\nof great benefit when interconnecting to systems (and talking with people) from the\\nworld of traditional telecommunications.\\n\\nAnalog Telephony\\nThe purpose of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is to establish and\\nmaintain audio connections between two endpoints in order to carry speech.\\nAlthough humans can perceive sound vibrations in the range of 2020,000 Hz,* most\\nof the sounds we make when speaking tend to be in the range of 2503,000 Hz. Since\\nthe purpose of the telephone network is to transmit the sounds of people speaking, it\\n* If you want to play around with what different frequencies look like on an oscilloscope, grab a copy of Sound\\n\\nFrequency Analyzer, from Reliable Software. It\\'s a really simple and fun way to visualize what sounds \"look\"\\nlike. The spectrograph gives a good picture of the complex harmonics our voices can generate, as well as an\\nappreciation for the background sounds that always surround us. You should also try the delightfully\\nannoying NCH Tone Generator, from NCH Swift Sound.\\n\\n\\x0cwas designed with a bandwidth of somewhere in the range of 3003,500 Hz. This\\nlimited bandwidth means that some sound quality will be lost (as anyone who\\'s had\\nto listen to music on hold can attest to), especially in the higher frequencies.\\n\\nParts of an Analog Telephone\\nAn analog phone is composed of five parts: the ringer, the dial pad, the hybrid (or\\nnetwork), and the hook switch and handset (both of which are considered parts of the\\nhybrid). The ringer, the dial pad, and the hybrid can operate completely independently\\nof one another.\\n\\nRinger\\nWhen the central office (CO) wants to signal an incoming call, it will connect an alternating current (AC) signal of roughly 90 volts to your circuit. This will cause the bell\\nin your telephone to produce a ringing sound. (In electronic telephones, this ringer may\\nbe a small electronic warbler rather than a bell. Ultimately, a ringer can be anything\\nthat is capable of reacting to the ringing voltage; for example, strobe lights are often\\nemployed in noisy environments such as factories.)\\nRinging voltage can be hazardous. Be very careful to take precautions\\nwhen working with an in-service telephone line.\\n\\nMany people confuse the AC voltage that triggers the ringer with the direct current\\n(DC) voltage that powers the phone. Remember that a ringer needs an alternating current in order to oscillate (just as a church bell won\\'t ring if you don\\'t supply the\\nmovement), and you\\'ve got it.\\nIn North America, the number of ringers you can connect to your line is dependent on\\nthe Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) of your various devices. (The REN must be\\nlisted on each device.) The total REN for all devices connected to your line cannot\\nexceed 5.0. An REN of 1.0 is equivalent to an old-fashioned analog set with an electromechanical ringer. Some electronic phones have an REN of 0.3 or even less. If you\\nconnect too many devices that require too much current, you will find that none of\\nthem will be able to ring.\\n\\nDial pad\\nWhen you place a telephone call, you need some way of letting the network know the\\naddress of the party you wish to reach. The dial pad is the portion of the phone that\\nprovides this functionality. In the early days of the PSTN, dial pads were in fact rotary\\ndevices that used pulses to indicate digits. This was a rather slow process, so the telephone companies eventually introduced touch-tone dialing. With touch-tone--also\\n\\n168 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cknown as Dual-Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)--dialing, the dial pad consists of 12\\nbuttons. Each button has two frequencies assigned to it (see Table 7-1).\\nTable 7-1. DTMF digits\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1633 Hz a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC\\n\\n\\n*\\n\\n\\n#\\n\\nD\\n\\nNotice that this column contains letters that are not typically present as keys on a telephone dial pad. They are part of the DTMF standard\\nnonetheless, and any proper telephone contains the electronics required to create them, even if it doesn\\'t contain the buttons themselves.\\n(These buttons actually do exist on some telephones, which are mostly used in military and government applications.)\\n\\nWhen you press a button on your dial pad, the two corresponding frequencies are\\ntransmitted down the line. The far end can interpret these frequencies and note which\\ndigit was pressed.\\n\\nHybrid (or network)\\nThe hybrid is a type of transformer that handles the need to combine the signals transmitted and received across a single pair of wires in the PSTN and two pairs of wires in\\nthe handset. One of the functions the hybrid performs is regulating sidetone, which is\\nthe amount of your transmitted signal that is returned to your earpiece; its purpose is\\nto provide a more natural-sounding conversation. Too much sidetone, and your voice\\nwill sound too loud; too little, and you\\'ll think the line has gone dead.\\nHook switch (or switch hook). This device signals the state of the telephone circuit to the CO.\\nWhen you pick up your telephone, the hook switch closes the loop between you and\\nthe CO, which is seen as a request for a dial tone. When you hang up, the hook switch\\nopens the circuit, which indicates that the call has ended.\\nThe hook switch can also be used for signaling purposes. Some electronic analog\\nphones have a button labeled Link that causes an event called a flash. You can perform\\na flash manually by depressing the hook switch for a duration of between 200 and 1,200\\nmilliseconds. If you leave it down for longer than that, the carrier may assume you\\'ve\\nhung up. The purpose of the Link button is to handle this timing for you. If you\\'ve ever\\nused call waiting or three-way calling on an analog line, you have performed a hook\\nswitch flash for the purpose of signaling the network.\\n\\n When referring to the state of an analog circuit, people often speak in terms of \"off-hook\" and \"on-hook.\"\\n\\nWhen your line is \"off-hook,\" your telephone is \"on\" a call. If your phone is \"on-hook,\" the telephone is\\nessentially \"off,\" or idle.\\n\\nAnalog Telephony | 169\\n\\x0cRing\\n\\nTip\\n\\nFigure 7-1. Tip and Ring\\n\\nHandset. The handset is composed of the transmitter and receiver. It performs the conversion between the sound energy humans use and the electrical energy the telephone\\nnetwork uses.\\n\\nTip and Ring\\nIn an analog telephone circuit, there are two wires. In North America, these wires are\\nreferred to as Tip and Ring. This terminology comes from the days when telephone\\ncalls were connected by live operators sitting at cord boards. The plugs that they used\\nhad two contactsone located at the tip of the plug and the other connected to the ring\\naround the middle (Figure 7-1).\\nThe Tip lead is the positive polarity wire. In North America, this wire is typically green\\nand provides the return path. The Ring wire is the negative polarity wire. In North\\nAmerica, this wire is normally red. For modern Cat 5 and 6 cables, the Tip is usually\\nthe white wire, and Ring is the coloured wire. When your telephone is on-hook, this\\nwire will have a potential of 48V DC with respect to Tip. Off-hook, this voltage drops\\nto roughly 7V DC.\\n\\nDigital Telephony\\nAnalog telephony is almost dead.\\nIn the PSTN, the famous Last Mile is the final remaining piece of the telephone network\\nstill using technology pioneered well over a hundred years ago.\\nOne of the primary challenges when transmitting analog signals is that all sorts of things\\ncan interfere with those signals, causing low volume, static, and all manner of other\\nundesired effects. Instead of trying to preserve an analog waveform over distances that\\nmay span thousands of miles, why not simply measure the characteristics of the original\\n\\n They may have other names elsewhere in the world (such as \"A\" and \"B\").\\n \"The Last Mile\" is a term that was originally used to describe the only portion of the PSTN that had not been\\n\\nconverted to fiber optics: the connection between the central office and the customer. The Last Mile is more\\nthan that, however, as it also has significance as a valuable asset of the traditional phone companies; they\\nown a connection into your home. The Last Mile is becoming more and more difficult to describe in technical\\nterms, as there are now so many ways to connect the network to the customer. As a thing of strategic value\\nto telecom, cable, and other utilities, its importance is obvious.\\n\\n170 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0csound and send that information to the far end? The original waveform wouldn\\'t get\\nthere, but all the information needed to reconstruct it would.\\nThis is the principle of all digital audio (including telephony): sample the characteristics\\nof the source waveform, store the measured information, and send that data to the far\\nend. Then, at the far end, use the transmitted information to generate a completely new\\naudio signal that has the same characteristics as the original. The reproduction is so\\ngood that the human ear can\\'t tell the difference.\\nThe principle advantage of digital audio is that the sampled data can be mathematically\\nchecked for errors all along the route to its destination, ensuring that a perfect duplicate\\nof the original arrives at the far end. Distance no longer affects quality, and interference\\ncan be detected and eliminated.\\n\\nPulse-Code Modulation\\nThere are several ways to digitally encode audio, but the most common method (and\\nthe one used in telephony systems) is known as Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM). To\\nillustrate how this works, let\\'s go through a few examples.\\n\\nDigitally encoding an analog waveform\\nThe principle of PCM is that the amplitudeof the analog waveform is sampled at specific intervals so that it can later be re-created. The amount of detail that is captured is\\ndependent both on the bit resolution of each sample and on how frequently the samples\\nare taken. A higher bit resolution and a higher sampling rate will provide greater accuracy, but more bandwidth will be required to transmit this more detailed information.\\nTo get a better idea of how PCM works, consider the waveform displayed in Figure 7-2.\\nTo digitally encode the wave, it must be sampled on a regular basis, and the amplitude\\nof the wave at each moment in time must be measured. The process of slicing up a\\nwaveform into moments in time and measuring the energy at each moment is called\\nquantization, or sampling.\\nThe samples will need to be taken frequently enough and will need to capture enough\\ninformation to ensure that the far end can re-create a sufficiently similar waveform. To\\nachieve a more accurate sample, more bits will be required. To explain this concept,\\nwe will start with a very low resolution, using four bits to represent our amplitude. This\\nwill make it easier to visualize both the quantization process itself and the effect that\\nresolution has on quality.\\n\\n Amplitude is essentially the power or strength of the signal. If you have ever held a skipping rope or garden\\n\\nhose and given it a whip, you have seen the resultant wave. The taller the wave, the greater the amplitude.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 171\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-2. A simple sinusoidal (sine) wave\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nFigure 7-3. Sampling our sine wave using four bits\\n\\nFigure 7-3 shows the information that will be captured when we sample our sine wave\\nat four-bit resolution.\\nAt each time interval, we measure the amplitude of the wave and record the corresponding intensity--in other words, we sample it. You will notice that the four-bit\\nresolution limits our accuracy. The first sample has to be rounded to 0011, and the next\\nquantization yields a sample of 0101. Then comes 0100, followed by 1001, 1011, and so\\nforth. In total, we have 14 samples (in reality, several thousand samples must be taken\\nper second).\\n\\n172 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-4. PCM encoded waveform\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nFigure 7-5.

This was done intentionally, to demonstrate an important point: the quality of the digitally encoded waveform is affected by the resolution\\nand rate at which it is sampled. At too low a sampling rate, and with too low a sample\\nresolution, the audio quality will not be acceptable.\\n\\nIncreasing the sampling resolution and rate\\nLet\\'s take another look at our original waveform, this time using five bits to define our\\nquantization intervals (Figure 7-7).\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 173\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-6.

However, you can also see that there is still room for improvement.\\nNote that 40 bits were required to encode the waveform at 4-bit resolution, while 156 bits were needed to send the same waveform using 5bit resolution (and also doubling the sampling rate). The point is, there\\nis a tradeoff: the higher the quality of audio you wish to encode, the\\nmore bits required to do it, and the more bits you wish to send (in real\\ntime, naturally), the more bandwidth you will need to consume.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 175\\n\\x0cAmplitude\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\nFigure 7-9.

That very same question was considered in the 1920s\\nby an electrical engineer (and AT&T/Bell employee) named Harry Nyquist. Nyquist\\'s\\nTheorem states: \"When sampling a signal, the sampling frequency must be greater than\\ntwice the bandwidth of the input signal in order to be able to reconstruct the original\\nperfectly from the sampled version.\"*\\n\\n176 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cIn essence, what this means is that to accurately encode an analog signal you have to\\nsample it twice as often as the total bandwidth you wish to reproduce. Since the telephone network will not carry frequencies below 300 Hz and above 4,000 Hz, a sampling\\nfrequency of 8,000 samples per second will be sufficient to reproduce any frequency\\nwithin the bandwidth of an analog telephone. Keep that 8,000 samples per second in\\nmind; we\\'re going to talk about it more later.\\n\\nLogarithmic companding\\nSo, we\\'ve gone over the basics of quantization, and we\\'ve discussed the fact that more\\nquantization intervals (i.e., a higher sampling rate) give better quality but also require\\nmore bandwidth. Lastly, we\\'ve discussed the minimum sample rate needed to accurately measure the range of frequencies we wish to be able to transmit (in the case of\\nthe telephone, it\\'s 8,000 Hz). This is all starting to add up to a fair bit of data being\\nsent on the wire, so we\\'re going to want to talk about companding.\\nCompanding is a method of improving the dynamic range of a sampling method without\\nlosing important accuracy. It works by quantizing higher amplitudes in a much coarser\\nfashion than lower amplitudes. In other words, if you yell into your phone, you will\\nnot be sampled as cleanly as you will be when speaking normally. Yelling is also not\\ngood for your blood pressure, so it\\'s best to avoid it.\\nTwo companding methods are commonly employed: law in North America, and\\nalaw in the rest of the world. They operate on the same principles but are otherwise\\nnot compatible with each other.\\nCompanding divides the waveform into cords, each of which has several steps. Quantization involves matching the measured amplitude to an appropriate step within a\\ncord. The value of the band and cord numbers (as well as the sign--positive or negative)\\nbecomes the signal. The following diagrams will give you a visual idea of what companding does. They are not based on any standard, but rather were made up for the\\npurpose of illustration (again, in the telephone network, companding will be done at\\nan eight-bit, not five-bit, resolution).\\nFigure 7-11 illustrates five-bit companding. As you can see, amplitudes near the zerocrossing point will be sampled far more accurately than higher amplitudes (either\\npositive or negative). However, since the human ear, the transmitter, and the receiver\\nwill also tend to distort loud signals, this isn\\'t really a problem.\\n* Nyquist published two papers, \"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed\" (1924) and \"Certain Topics in\\n\\nTelegraph Transmission Theory\" (1928), in which he postulated what became known as Nyquist\\'s Theorem.\\nProven in 1949 by Claude Shannon (\"Communication in the Presence of Noise\"), it is also referred to as the\\nNyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\\n law is often referred to as \"ulaw\" because, let\\'s face it, how many of us have  keys on our keyboards?  is\\n\\nin fact the Greek letter Mu; thus, you will also see law written (more correctly) as \"Mu-law.\" When spoken,\\nit is correct to confidently say \"Mew-law,\" but if folks look at you strangely, and you\\'re feeling generous, you\\ncan help them out and tell them it\\'s \"ulaw.\" Many people just don\\'t appreciate trivia.\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 177\\n\\x0cSign-bit Cord-bit\\n\\n\\nStep-bit\\n\\n\\nLow accuracy\\n\\n\\n\\nReduced accuracy\\n\\nAmplitude\\n\\n\\nAccurate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHighly accurate\\nHighly accurate\\n\\n\\nAccurate\\n\\n\\nReduced accuracy\\n\\n\\n\\nLow accuracy\\n\\nSamples\\n\\nFigure 7-11.

In PSTN, that includes any audio frequencies above\\n4,000 Hz (half the sampling rate of 8,000 Hz). This problem is easily corrected by\\npassing the audio through a low-pass filter before presenting it to the A/D converter.\\n A low-pass filter, as its name implies, allows through only frequencies that are lower than its cut-off frequency.\\n\\nOther types of filters are high-pass filters (which remove low frequencies) and band-pass filters (which filter\\nout both high and low frequencies).\\n\\nDigital Telephony | 179\\n\\x0cThe Digital Circuit-Switched Telephone Network\\nFor over a hundred years, telephone networks were exclusively circuit-switched. What\\nthis meant was that for every telephone call made, a dedicated connection was established between the two endpoints, with a fixed amount of bandwidth allocated to that\\ncircuit. Creating such a network was costly, and where distance was concerned, using\\nthat network was costly as well. Although we are all predicting the end of the circuitswitched network, many people still use it every day, and it really does work rather well.\\n\\nCircuit Types\\nIn the PSTN, there are many different sizes of circuits serving the various needs of the\\nnetwork. Between the central office and a subscriber, one or more analog circuits, or a\\nfew dozen channels delivered over a digital circuit, generally suffice. Between PSTN\\noffices (and with larger customers), fiber-optic circuits are generally used.\\n\\nThe humble DS-0the foundation of it all\\nSince the standard method of digitizing a telephone call is to record an 8-bit sample\\n8,000 times per second, we can see that a PCM-encoded telephone circuit will need a\\nbandwidth of eight times 8,000 bits per second, or 64,000 bps. This 64 Kbps channel\\nis referred to as a DS-0 (that\\'s \"Dee-Ess-Zero\"). The DS-0 is the fundamental building\\nblock of all digital telecommunications circuits.\\nEven the ubiquitous analog circuit is sampled into a DS-0 as soon as possible. Sometimes this happens where your circuit terminates at the central office, and sometimes\\nwell before.\\n\\nT-carrier circuits\\nThe venerable T1 is one of the more recognized digital telephony terms. A T1 is a digital\\ncircuit consisting of 24 DS-0s multiplexed together into a 1.544 Mbps bitstream.# This\\nbit stream is properly defined as a DS-1. Voice is encoded on a T1 using the law\\ncompanding algorithm.\\n\\n If you ever have to do audio recordings for a system, you might want to take advantage of the band-pass filter\\n\\nthat is built into most telephone sets. Doing a recording using even high-end recording equipment can pick\\nup all kinds of background noise that you don\\'t even hear until you downsample, at which point the\\nbackground noise produces aliasing (which can sound like all kinds of weird things). Conversely, the phone\\nrecords in the correct format already, so the noise never enters the audio stream. Having said all that, no\\nmatter what you use to do recordings, avoid environments that have a lot of background noise. Typical offices\\ncan be a lot noisier than you\\'d think, as HVAC equipment can produce noise that we don\\'t even realize is there.\\n Digital telephone sets (including IP sets) do the analog-to-digital conversion right at the point where the\\n\\nhandset plugs into the phone, so the DS-0 is created right at the phone set.\\n# The 24 DS-0s use 1.536 Mbps, and the remaining .008 Mbps is used by framing bits.\\n\\n180 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cThe European version of the T1 was developed by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations* (CEPT),\\nand was first referred to as a CEPT-1. It is now called an E1.\\nThe E1 is comprised of 32 DS-0s, but the method of PCM encoding is\\ndifferent: E1s use alaw companding. This means that connecting between an E1-based network and a T1-based network will always require\\na transcoding step. Note that an E1, although it has 32 channels, is also\\nconsidered a DS-1. It is likely that E1 is far more widely deployed, as it\\nis used everywhere in the world except North American and Japan.\\n\\nThe various other T-carriers (T2, T3, and T4) are multiples of the T1, each based on\\nthe humble DS-0. Table 7-2 illustrates the relationships between the different T-carrier\\ncircuits.\\nTable 7-2.

SONET is based on the\\nbandwidth of a T3 (44.736 Mbps), with a slight overhead making it 51.84 Mbps. This\\nis referred to as an OC-1 or STS-1.

Mechanisms must also be provided to pass information about\\nthe state of the channel between each endpoint. (Disconnect and answer supervision\\nare two examples of basic signaling that might need to take place; Caller ID is an example of a more complex form of signaling.)\\n\\nChannel Associated Signaling (CAS)\\nAlso known as robbed-bit signaling, CAS is what you will use to transmit voice on a\\nT1 when ISDN is not available. Rather than taking advantage of the power of the digital\\ncircuit, CAS simulates analog channels. CAS works by stealing bits from the audio\\nstream for signaling purposes. Although the effect on audio quality is not really noticeable, the lack of a powerful signaling channel limits your flexibility.\\nWhen configuring a CAS T1, the signaling options at each end must match. E&M (Ear\\n& Mouth or recEive & transMit) signaling is generally preferred, as it offers the best\\nsupervision. Having said that, in an Asterisk environment the most likely reason for\\nyou to use CAS would be for a channel bank, which means you are most likely going\\nto have to use FXS signaling.\\nCAS is very rarely used on PSTN circuits anymore, due to the superiority of ISDN-PRI.\\nOne of the limitations of CAS is that it does not allow the dynamic assignment of\\nchannels to different functions. Also, Caller ID information (which may not even be\\nsupported) has to be sent as part of the audio stream. CAS is commonly used on the\\nT1 link in channel banks.\\n\\nISDN\\nThe Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) has been around for more than 20\\nyears. Because it separates the channels that carry the traffic (the bearer channels, or\\nB-channels) from the channel that carries the signaling information (the D-channel),\\nISDN allows for the delivery of a much richer set of features than CAS. In the beginning,\\nISDN promised to deliver much the same sort of functionality that the Internet has\\ngiven us, including advanced capabilities for voice, video, and data transfer.\\nUnfortunately, rather than ratifying a standard and sticking to it, the respective telecommunications manufacturers all decided to add their own tweaks to the protocol,\\nin the belief that their versions were superior and would eventually dominate the market. As a result, getting two ISDN-compliant systems to connect to each other was often\\na painful and expensive task. The carriers who had to implement and support this\\n\\n182 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0cexpensive technology, in turn, priced it so that it was not rapidly adopted. Currently,\\nISDN is rarely used for much more than basic trunking--in fact, the acronym ISDN\\nhas become a joke in the industry: \"It Still Does Nothing.\"\\nHaving said that, ISDN has become quite popular for trunking, and it is now (mostly)\\nstandards-compliant. If you have a PBX with more than a dozen lines connected to the\\nPSTN, there\\'s a very good chance that you\\'ll be running an ISDN-PRI (Primary Rate\\nInterface) circuit. Also, in places where DSL and cable access to the Internet are not\\navailable (or are too expensive), an ISDN-BRI (Basic Rate Interface) circuit might provide you with an affordable 128 Kbps connection. In much of North America, the use\\nof BRI for Internet connectivity has been deprecated in favor of DSL and cable modems\\n(and it is never used for voice), but in many European countries it has almost totally\\nreplaced analog circuits.\\nISDN-BRI/BRA. Basic Rate Interface (or Basic Rate Access) is the flavor of ISDN, and is\\ndesigned to service small endpoints such as workstations.\\nThe BRI flavor of the ISDN specification is often referred to simply as \"ISDN,\" but this\\ncan be a source of confusion, as ISDN is a protocol, not a type of circuit (not to mention\\nthat PRI circuits are also correctly referred to as ISDN!).\\nA Basic Rate ISDN circuit consists of two 64 Kbps B-channels controlled by a 16-Kbps\\nD-channel, for a total of 144 Kbps.\\nBasic Rate ISDN has been a source of much confusion during its life, due to problems\\nwith standards compliance, technical complexity, and poor documentation. Still, many\\nEuropean telecos have widely implemented ISDN-BRI, and thus it is more popular in\\nEurope than in North America.\\nISDN-PRI/PRA. The Primary Rate Interface (or Primary Rate Access) flavor of ISDN is used\\nto provide ISDN service over larger network connections. A Primary Rate ISDN circuit\\nuses a single DS-0 channel as a signaling link (the D-channel); the remaining channels\\nserve as B-channels.\\nIn North America, Primary Rate ISDN is commonly carried on one or more T1 circuits.\\nSince a T1 has 24 channels, a North American PRI circuit typically consists of 23 Bchannels and 1 D-channel. For this reason, PRI is often referred to as 23B+D.\\nIn Europe, a 32-channel E1 circuit is used, so a Primary Rate ISDN circuit is referred to as 30B+D (the final channel is used for\\nsynchronization).\\n\\n PRI is actually quite a bit more flexible than that, as it is possible to span a single PRI circuit across multiple\\n\\nT1 spans. This can give rise, for example, to a 47B+D circuit (where a single D-channel serves two T1s) or a\\n46B+2D circuit (where primary and backup D-channels serve a pair of T1s). You will sometimes see PRI\\ndescribed as nB+nD, because the number of B- and D-channels is, in fact, quite variable. For this reason, you\\nshould never refer to a T1 carrying PRI as \"a PRI.\" For all you know, the PRI circuit spans multiple T1s, as\\nis common in larger PBX deployments.\\n\\nThe Digital Circuit-Switched Telephone Network | 183\\n\\x0cPrimary Rate ISDN is very popular, due to its technical benefits and generally competitive pricing at higher densities. If you believe you will require more than a dozen or so\\nPSTN lines, you should look into Primary Rate ISDN pricing.\\nFrom a technical perspective, ISDN-PRI is always preferable to CAS.\\n\\nSignaling System 7\\nSignaling System 7 (SS7) is the signaling system used by carriers. It is conceptually\\nsimilar to ISDN, and it is instrumental in providing a mechanism for the carriers to\\ntransmit the additional information ISDN endpoints typically need to pass. However,\\nthe technology of SS7 is different from that of ISDN; one big difference is that SS7 runs\\non a completely separate network from the actual trunks that carry the calls.\\nSS7 support in Asterisk is on the horizon, as there is much interest in making Asterisk\\ncompatible with the carrier networks. An open source version of SS7 (http://\\nwww.openss7.org) exists, but work is still needed for full SS7 compliance, and as of this\\nwriting it is not known whether this version will be integrated with Asterisk. Another\\npromising source of SS7 support comes from Sangoma Technologies, which offers SS7\\nfunctionality in many of its products.\\nIt should be noted that adding support for SS7 in Asterisk is not going to be as simple\\nas writing a proper driver. Connecting equipment to an SS7 network will not be possible\\nwithout that equipment having passed extremely rigorous certification processes. Even\\nthen, it seems doubtful that any traditional carrier is going to be in a hurry to allow\\nsuch a thing to happen, mostly for strategic and political reasons.\\n\\nPacket-Switched Networks\\nIn the mid-1990s, network performance improved to the point where it became possible\\nto send a stream of media information in real time across a network connection. Because\\nthe media stream is chopped up into segments, which are then wrapped in an addressing envelope, such connections are referred to as packet-based. The challenge, of course,\\nis to send a flood of these packets between two endpoints, ensuring that the packets\\narrive in the same order in which they were sent, in less than 150 milliseconds, with\\nnone lost. This is the essence of Voice over IP.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis chapter has explored the technologies currently in use in the PSTN. In the next\\nchapter, we will discuss protocols for VoIP: the carrying of telephone connections\\nacross IP-based networks. These protocols define different mechanisms for carrying\\ntelephone conversations, but their significance is far greater than just that. Bringing the\\ntelephone network into the data network will finally erase the line between telephones\\nand computers, which holds the promise of a revolutionary evolution in the way we\\ncommunicate.\\n184 | Chapter 7: Understanding Telephony\\n\\x0c\\nProtocols for VoIP\\n\\nThe Internet is a telephone system that\\'s gotten uppity.\\n--Clifford Stoll\\n\\nThe telecommunications industry spans over 100 years, and Asterisk integrates most\\n--if not all--of the major technologies that it has made use of over the last century. To\\nmake the most out of Asterisk, you need not be a professional in all areas, but understanding the differences between the various codecs and protocols will give you a\\ngreater appreciation and understanding of the system as a whole.\\nThis chapter explains Voice over IP and what makes VoIP networks different from the\\ntraditional circuit-switched voice networks that were the topic of the last chapter. We\\nwill explore the need for VoIP protocols, outlining the history and potential future of\\neach. We\\'ll also look at security considerations and these protocols\\' abilities to work\\nwithin topologies such as Network Address Translation (NAT).

The challenges to accomplishing this relate to the\\nmanner in which humans communicate. Not only must the signal arrive in essentially\\nthe same form that it was transmitted in, but it needs to do so in less than 150 milliseconds. If packets are lost or delayed, there will be degradation to the quality of the\\ncommunications experience, meaning that two people will have difficulty in carrying\\non a conversation.\\nThe transport protocols that collectively are called \"the Internet\" were not originally\\ndesigned with real-time streaming of media in mind. Endpoints were expected to resolve missing packets by waiting longer for them to arrive, requesting retransmission,\\nor, in some cases, considering the information to be gone for good and simply carrying\\non without it. In a typical voice conversation, these mechanisms will not serve. Our\\nconversations do not adapt well to the loss of letters or words, nor to any appreciable\\ndelay between transmittal and receipt.\\nThe traditional PSTN was designed specifically for the purpose of voice transmission,\\nand it is perfectly suited to the task from a technical standpoint. From a flexibility\\nstandpoint, however, its flaws are obvious to even people with a very limited understanding of the technology. VoIP holds the promise of incorporating voice communications into all of the other protocols we carry on our networks, but due to the special\\ndemands of a voice conversation, special skills are needed to design, build, and maintain\\nthese networks.\\nThe problem with packet-based voice transmission stems from the fact that the way in\\nwhich we speak is totally incompatible with the way in which IP transports data.\\n* This word hasn\\'t quite made it into the dictionary, but it is a term that is becoming more and more common.\\n\\nIt refers to the process of chopping a steady stream of information into discrete chunks (or packets), suitable\\nfor delivery independently of one another.\\n\\n186 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cSpeaking and listening consist of the relaying of a stream of audio, whereas the Internet\\nprotocols are designed to chop everything up, encapsulate the bits of information into\\nthousands of packages, and then deliver each package in whatever way possible to the\\nfar end. Clearly, some way of dealing with this is required.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols\\nThe mechanism for carrying a VoIP connection generally involves a series of signaling\\ntransactions between the endpoints (and gateways in between), culminating into two\\npersistent media streams (one for each direction) that carry the actual conversation.\\nThere are several protocols in existence to handle this. In this section, we will discuss\\nsome of those that are important to VoIP in general and to Asterisk specifically.\\n\\nIAX (The \"Inter-Asterisk eXchange\" Protocol)\\nIf you claim to be one of the folks in the know when it comes to Asterisk, your test will\\ncome when you have to pronounce the name of this protocol. It would seem that you\\nshould say \"eye-ay-ex\", but this hardly rolls off the tongue very well. Fortunately, the\\nproper pronunciation is in fact \"eeks.\" IAX is an open protocol, meaning that anyone\\ncan download and develop for it, but it is not yet a standard of any kind.\\nIt is expected that IAX2 will become an IETF protocol soon. IAX2 is currently in draft\\nstatus with the IETF, and it is widely expected to become an official protocol in a few\\nyears\\' time.\\nIn Asterisk, IAX is supported by the chan_iax2.so module.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe IAX protocol was developed by Digium for the purpose of communicating with\\nother Asterisk servers (hence the Inter-Asterisk eXchange protocol). It is very important\\nto note that IAX is not at all limited to Asterisk. The standard is open for anyone to\\nuse, and it is supported by many other open source telecom projects, as well as by\\nseveral hardware vendors. IAX is a transport protocol (much like SIP) that uses a single\\nUDP port (4569) for both the channel signaling and media streams. As discussed later\\nin this chapter, this makes it easier to manage when behind NATed firewalls.\\nIAX also has the unique ability to trunk multiple sessions into one dataflow, which can\\nbe a tremendous bandwidth advantage when sending a lot of simultaneous channels\\nto a remote box. Trunking allows multiple media streams to be represented with a\\n It sounds like the name of a Dutch football team.\\n Go ahead. Say it. Now that sounds much better, doesn\\'t it?\\n Officially, the current version is IAX2, but all support for IAX1 has been dropped, so whether you say \"IAX\"\\n\\nor \"IAX2,\" it is expected that you are talking about the same version.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 187\\n\\x0csingle datagram header, that will lower the overhead associated with individual\\nchannels. This helps to lower latency and reduce the processing power and bandwidth\\nrequired, allowing the protocol to scale much more easily with a large number of active\\nchannels between endpoints. If you have a large quantity of IP calls to pass between\\ntwo endpoints, you should take a close look at IAX trunking.\\n\\nFuture\\nSince IAX was optimized for voice, it has received some criticism for not better supporting video--but in fact, IAX holds the potential to carry pretty much any media\\nstream desired. Because it is an open protocol, future media types are certain to be\\nincorporated as the community desires them.\\n\\nSecurity considerations\\nIAX includes the ability to authenticate in three ways: plain text, MD5 hashing, and\\nRSA key exchange. This, of course, does nothing to encrypt the media path or headers\\nbetween endpoints. Many solutions include using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\\nappliance or software to encrypt the stream in another layer of technology, which requires the endpoints to pre-establish a method of having these tunnels configured and\\noperational. However, IAX is now also able to encrypt the streams between endpoints\\nwith dynamic key exchange at call setup (using the configuration option encryp\\ntion=aes128), allowing the use of automatic key rollover.\\n\\nIAX and NAT\\nThe IAX2 protocol was deliberately designed to work from behind devices performing\\nNAT. The use of a single UDP port for both signaling and transmission of media also\\nkeeps the number of holes required in your firewall to a minimum. These considerations\\nhave helped make IAX one of the easiest protocols (if not the easiest) to implement in\\nsecure networks.\\n\\nSIP\\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has taken the telecommunications industry by\\nstorm. SIP has pretty much dethroned the once-mighty H.323 as the VoIP protocol of\\nchoice--certainly at the endpoints of the network. The premise of SIP is that each end\\nof a connection is a peer; the protocol negotiates capabilities between them. What\\nmakes SIP compelling is that it is a relatively simple protocol, with a syntax similar to\\nthat of other familiar protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. SIP is supported in Asterisk\\nwith the chan_sip.so module.\\n\\nHistory\\nSIP was originally submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in February\\nof 1996 as \"draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-00.\" The initial draft looked nothing like the SIP we\\n188 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cSIP signaling\\n\\nRTP media\\n\\nFigure 8-1. The SIP trapezoid\\n\\nknow today and contained only a single request type: a call setup request. In March of\\n1999, after 11 revisions, SIP RFC 2543 was born.\\nAt first, SIP was all but ignored, as H.323 was considered the protocol of choice for\\nVoIP transport negotiation. However, as the buzz grew, SIP began to gain popularity,\\nand while there may be a lot of different factors that accelerated its growth, we\\'d like\\nto think that a large part of its success is due to its freely available specification.\\nSIP is an application-layer signaling protocol that uses the well-known port 5060 for\\ncommunications. SIP can be transported with either the UDP or TCP transport-layer\\nprotocols. Asterisk does not currently have a TCP implementation for transporting SIP\\nmessages, but it is possible that future versions may support it (and patches to the code\\nbase are gladly accepted). SIP is used to \"establish, modify, and terminate multimedia\\nsessions such as Internet telephony calls.\"#\\nSIP does not transport media between endpoints.\\nRTP is used to transmit media (i.e., voice) between endpoints. RTP uses high-numbered, unprivileged ports in Asterisk (10,000 through 20,000, by default).\\nA common topology to illustrate SIP and RTP, commonly referred to as the \"SIP trapezoid,\" is shown in Figure 8-1. When Alice wants to call Bob, Alice\\'s phone contacts\\nher proxy server, and the proxy tries to find Bob (often connecting through his proxy).\\nOnce the phones have started the call, they communicate directly with each other (if\\npossible), so that the data doesn\\'t have to tie up the resources of the proxy.\\nSIP was not the first, and is not the only, VoIP protocol in use today (others include H.\\n323, MGCP, IAX, and so on), but currently it seems to have the most momentum with\\nhardware vendors. The advantages of the SIP protocol lie in its wide acceptance and\\narchitectural flexibility (and, we used to say, simplicity!).\\n\\n Having just called SIP simple, it should be noted that it is by no means lightweight. It has been said that if\\n\\none were to read all of the IETF RFCs that are relevant to SIP, one would have more than 3,000 pages of\\nreading to do. SIP is quickly earning a reputation for being far too bloated, but that does nothing to lessen\\nits popularity.\\n# RFC 3261, SIP: Session Initiation Protocol, p. 9, Section 2.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 189\\n\\x0cFuture\\nSIP has earned its place as the protocol that justified VoIP. All new user and enterprise\\nproducts are expected to support SIP, and any existing products will now be a tough\\nsell unless a migration path to SIP is offered. SIP is widely expected to deliver far more\\nthan VoIP capabilities, including the ability to transmit video, music, and any type of\\nreal-time multimedia. While its use as a ubiquitous general-purpose media transport\\nmechanism seems doubtful, SIP is unarguably poised to deliver the majority of new\\nvoice applications for the next few years.\\n\\nSecurity considerations\\nSIP uses a challenge/response system to authenticate users. An initial INVITE is sent to\\nthe proxy with which the end device wishes to communicate. The proxy then sends\\nback a 407 Proxy Authorization Request message, which contains a random set of\\ncharacters referred to as a nonce. This nonce is used along with the password to generate\\nan MD5 hash, which is then sent back in the subsequent INVITE. Assuming the MD5\\nhash matches the one that the proxy generated, the client is then authenticated.\\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks are probably the most common type of attack on VoIP\\ncommunications. A DoS attack can occur when a large number of invalid INVITE requests are sent to a proxy server in an attempt to overwhelm the system. These attacks\\nare relatively simple to implement, and their effects on the users of the system are\\nimmediate. SIP has several methods of minimizing the effects of DoS attacks, but ultimately they are impossible to prevent.\\nSIP implements a scheme to guarantee that a secure, encrypted transport mechanism\\n(namely Transport Layer Security, or TLS) is used to establish communication between\\nthe caller and the domain of the callee. Beyond that, the request is sent securely to the\\nend device, based upon the local security policies of the network. Note that the encryption of the media (that is, the RTP stream) is beyond the scope of SIP itself and\\nmust be dealt with separately.\\nMore information regarding SIP security considerations, including registration hijacking, server impersonation, and session teardown, can be found in Section 26 of SIP RFC\\n3261.\\n\\nSIP and NAT\\nProbably the biggest technical hurdle SIP has to conquer is the challenge of carrying\\nout transactions across a NAT layer. Because SIP encapsulates addressing information\\nin its data frames, and NAT happens at a lower network layer, the addressing information is not automatically modified and, thus, the media streams will not have the\\ncorrect addressing information needed to complete the connection when NAT is in\\nplace. In addition to this, the firewalls normally integrated with NAT will not consider\\nthe incoming media stream to be part of the SIP transaction, and will block the connection. Newer firewalls and Session Border Controllers are SIP-aware, but this is still\\n190 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cconsidered a shortcoming in this protocol, and it causes no end of trouble to network\\nprofessionals needing to connect SIP endpoints using existing network infrastructure.\\n\\nThis International Telecommunication Union (ITU) protocol was originally designed\\nto provide an IP transport mechanism for video conferencing. It has become the standard in IP-based video-conferencing equipment, and it briefly enjoyed fame as a VoIP\\nprotocol as well. While there is much heated debate over whether SIP or H.323 (or\\nIAX) will dominate the VoIP protocol world, in Asterisk, H.323 has largely been deprecated in favor of IAX and SIP. H.323 has not enjoyed much success among users and\\nenterprises, although it might still be the most widely used VoIP protocol among carriers.\\nThe three versions of H.323 supported in Asterisk are handled by the modules\\nchan_h323.so (supplied with Asterisk), chan_oh323.so (available as a free add-on), and\\nchan_ooh323.so (supplied in asterisk-addons).\\nYou have probably used H.323 without even knowing it--Microsoft\\'s\\nNetMeeting client is arguably the most widely deployed H.323 client.\\n\\nHistory\\nH.323 was developed by the ITU in May of 1996 as a means to transmit voice, video,\\ndata, and fax communications across an IP-based network while maintaining connectivity with the PSTN. Since that time, H.323 has gone through several versions and\\nannexes (which add functionality to the protocol), allowing it to operate in pure VoIP\\nnetworks and more widely distributed networks.\\n\\nFuture\\nThe future of H.323 is a subject of debate. If the media is any measure, it doesn\\'t look\\ngood for H.323; it hardly ever gets mentioned (certainly not with the regularity of SIP).\\nH.323 is often regarded as technically superior to SIP, but, as with so many other technologies, that sort of thing is seldom the deciding factor in whether technology enjoys\\nsuccess. One of the factors that makes H.323 unpopular is its complexity--although\\nmany argue that the once-simple SIP is starting to suffer from the same problem.\\nH.323 still carries by far the majority of worldwide carrier VoIP traffic, but as people\\nbecome less and less dependent on traditional carriers for their telecom needs, the\\nfuture of H.323 becomes more difficult to predict with any certainty. While H.323 may\\nnot be the protocol of choice for new implementations, we can certainly expect to have\\nto deal with H.323 interoperability issues for some time to come.\\n\\nVoIP Protocols | 191\\n\\x0cSecurity considerations\\nH.323 is a relatively secure protocol and does not require many security considerations\\nbeyond those that are common to any network communicating with the Internet. Since\\nH.323 uses the RTP protocol for media communications, it does not natively support\\nencrypted media paths. The use of a VPN or other encrypted tunnel between endpoints\\nis the most common way of securely encapsulating communications. Of course, this\\nhas the disadvantage of requiring the establishment of these secure tunnels between\\nendpoints, which may not always be convenient (or even possible). As VoIP becomes\\nused more often to communicate with financial institutions such as banks, we\\'re likely\\nto require extensions to the most commonly used VoIP protocols to natively support\\nstrong encryption methods.\\n\\nH.323 and NAT\\nThe H.323 standard uses the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RTP protocol to\\ntransport media between endpoints. Because of this, H.323 has the same issues as SIP\\nwhen dealing with network topologies involving NAT. The easiest method is to simply\\nforward the appropriate ports through your NAT device to the internal client.\\nTo receive calls, you will always need to forward TCP port 1720 to the client. In addition, you will need to forward the UDP ports for the RTP media and RTCP control\\nstreams (see the manual for your device for the port range it requires). Older clients,\\nsuch as Microsoft NetMeeting, will also require TCP ports forwarded for H.245 tunneling (again, see your client\\'s manual for the port number range).\\nIf you have a number of clients behind the NAT device, you will need to use a\\ngatekeeper running in proxy mode. The gatekeeper will require an interface attached\\nto the private IP subnet and the public Internet. Your H.323 client on the private IP\\nsubnet will then register to the gatekeeper, which will proxy calls on the clients\\' behalf.\\nNote that any external clients that wish to call you will also be required to register with\\nthe proxy server.\\nAt this time, Asterisk can\\'t act as an H.323 gatekeeper. You\\'ll have to use a separate\\napplication, such as the open source OpenH323 Gatekeeper (http://www.gnugk.org).\\n\\nMGCP\\nThe Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) also comes to us from the IETF. While\\nMGCP deployment is more widespread than one might think, it is quickly losing\\nground to protocols such as SIP and IAX. Still, Asterisk loves protocols, so naturally it\\nhas rudimentary support for it.\\nMGCP is defined in RFC 3435.* It was designed to make the end devices (such as\\nphones) as simple as possible, and have all the call logic and processing handled by\\n* RFC 3435 obsoletes RFC 2705.\\n\\n192 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cmedia gateways and call agents. Unlike SIP, MGCP uses a centralized model. MGCP\\nphones cannot directly call other MGCP phones; they must always go through some\\ntype of controller.\\nAsterisk supports MGCP through the chan_mgcp.so module, and the endpoints are\\ndefined in the configuration file mgcp.conf. Since Asterisk provides only basic call agent\\nservices, it cannot emulate an MGCP phone (to register to another MGCP controller\\nas a user agent, for example).\\nIf you have some MGCP phones lying around, you will be able to use them with Asterisk. If you are planning to put MGCP phones into production on an Asterisk system,\\nkeep in mind that the community has moved on to more popular protocols, and you\\nwill therefore need to budget your software support needs accordingly. If possible (for\\nexample, with Cisco phones), you should upgrade MGCP phones to SIP.\\n\\nProprietary Protocols\\nFinally, let\\'s take a look at two proprietary protocols that are supported in Asterisk.\\n\\nSkinny/SCCP\\nThe Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) is proprietary to Cisco VoIP equipment. It\\nis the default protocol for endpoints on a Cisco Call Manager PBX. Skinny is supported\\nin Asterisk, but if you are connecting Cisco phones to Asterisk, it is generally recommended that you obtain SIP images for any phones that support it and connect via SIP\\ninstead.\\n\\nUNISTIM\\nSupport for Nortel\\'s proprietary VoIP protocol, UNISTIM, means that Asterisk is the\\nfirst PBX in history to natively support proprietary IP terminals from the two biggest\\nplayers in VoIP--Nortel and Cisco. UNISTIM support is totally experimental, and does\\nnot work well enough to put into production, but the fact that somebody took the\\ntrouble to do this demonstrates the power of the Asterisk platform.\\n\\nCodecs\\nCodecs are generally understood to be various mathematical models used to digitally\\nencode (and compress) analog audio information. Many of these models take into account the human brain\\'s ability to form an impression from incomplete information.\\nWe\\'ve all seen optical illusions; likewise, voice-compression algorithms take advantage\\nof our tendency to interpret what we believe we should hear, rather than what we\\n\\n Cisco has recently announced that it will be migrating toward SIP in its future products.\\n\\nCodecs | 193\\n\\x0cactually hear. The purpose of the various encoding algorithms is to strike a balance\\nbetween efficiency and quality.\\nOriginally, the term codec referred to a COder/DECoder: a device that converts between\\nanalog and digital. Now, the term seems to relate more to COmpression/\\nDECompression.\\nBefore we dig into the individual codecs, take a look at Table 8-1--it\\'s a quick reference\\nthat you may want to refer back to.\\nTable 8-1.

In fact, if someone refers to PCM (discussed in the previous chapter) with respect to a telephone network, you are allowed\\nto think of G.711. Two companding methods are used: law in North America and\\nalaw in the rest of the world. Either one delivers an 8-bit word transmitted 8,000 times\\nper second. If you do the math, you will see that this requires 64,000 bits to be transmitted per second.\\nMany people will tell you that G.711 is an uncompressed codec. This is not exactly\\ntrue, as companding is considered a form of compression. What is true is that G.711\\nis the base codec from which all of the others are derived.\\nG.711 imposes minimal (almost zero) load on the CPU.\\n\\n \"Aoccdrnig to rsereach at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn\\'t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the\\n\\nolny iprmoetnt tihng is taht frist and lsat ltteres are in the rghit pclae.

We do\\nthe same thing with soundif there is enough information, our brain can fill in the gaps.\\n On an audio CD, quality is far more important than saving bandwidth, so the audio is quantized at 16 bits\\n\\n(times 2, as it\\'s stereo), with a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz. Considering that the CD was invented in the late\\n1970s, this was quite impressive stuff back then. The telephone network does not require this level of quality\\n(and needs to optimize bandwidth), so telephone signals are encoded using 8 bits, at a sampling frequency\\nof 8,000 Hz.\\n\\n194 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cThis codec has been around for some time (it used to be G.721, which is now obsolete),\\nand it is one of the original compressed codecs. It is also known as Adaptive Differential\\nPulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM), and it can run at several bitrates. The most common rates are 16 Kbps, 24 Kbps, and 32 Kbps. As of this writing, Asterisk currently\\nsupports only the ADPCM-32 rate, which is far and away the most popular rate for this\\ncodec.\\nG.726 offers quality nearly identical to G.711, but it uses only half the bandwidth. This\\nis possible because rather than sending the result of the quantization measurement, it\\nsends only enough information to describe the difference between the current sample\\nand the previous one. G.726 fell from favor in the 1990s due to its inability to carry\\nmodem and fax signals, but because of its bandwidth/CPU performance ratio it is now\\nmaking a comeback. G.726 is especially attractive because it does not require a lot of\\ncomputational work from the system.\\n\\nConsidering how little bandwidth it uses, G.729A delivers impressive sound quality. It\\ndoes this through the use of Conjugate-Structure Algebraic-Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CS-ACELP). Because of patents, you can\\'t use G729A without paying a\\nlicensing fee; however, it is extremely popular and is, thus, well supported on many\\ndifferent phones and systems.\\nTo achieve its impressive compression ratio, this codec requires an equally impressive\\namount of effort from the CPU. In an Asterisk system, the use of heavily compressed\\ncodecs will quickly bog down the CPU.\\nG.729A uses 8 Kbps of bandwidth.\\n\\nGSM\\nGSM is the darling codec of Asterisk. This codec does not come encumbered with a\\nlicensing requirement the way that G.729A does, and it offers outstanding performance\\nwith respect to the demand it places on the CPU. The sound quality is generally considered to be of a lesser grade than that produced by G.729A, but much of this comes\\ndown to personal opinion; be sure to try it out. GSM operates at 13 Kbps.\\n\\n CELP is a popular method of compressing speech. By mathematically modeling the various ways humans\\n\\nmake sounds, a codebook of sounds can be built. Rather than sending an actual sampled sound, a code\\ncorresponding to the sound is determined. CELP codecs take this information (which by itself would produce\\na very robot-like sound) and attempt to add the personality back in. (Of course, there is much more to it than\\nthat.) Jason Woodward\\'s Speech Coding page (http://www-mobile.ecs.soton.ac.uk/speech_codecs/) is a source\\nof helpful information for the non-mathematically inclined. This is fairly heavy stuff, though, so wear your\\nthinking cap.\\n\\nCodecs | 195\\n\\x0ciLBC\\nThe Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC) provides an attractive mix of low bandwidth\\nusage and quality, and it is especially well suited to sustaining reasonable quality on\\nlossy network links.\\nNaturally, Asterisk supports it (and support elsewhere is growing), but it is not as\\npopular as the ITU codecs and, thus, may not be compatible with common IP telephones and commercial VoIP systems. IETF RFCs 3951 and 3952 have been published\\nin support of iLBC, and iLBC is on the IETF standards track.\\nBecause iLBC uses complex algorithms to achieve its high levels of compression, it has\\na fairly high CPU cost in Asterisk.\\nWhile you are allowed to use iLBC without paying royalty fees, the holder of the iLBC\\npatent, Global IP Sound (GIPS), wants to know whenever you use it in a commercial\\napplication. The way you do that is by downloading and printing a copy of the iLBC\\nlicense, signing it, and returning it to GIPS. If you want to read about iLBC and its\\nlicense, you can do so at http://www.ilbcfreeware.org.\\niLBC operates at 13.3 Kbps (30 ms frames) and 15.2 Kbps (20 ms frames).\\n\\nSpeex\\nSpeex is a variable bitrate (VBR) codec, which means that it is able to dynamically\\nmodify its bitrate to respond to changing network conditions. It is offered in both\\nnarrowband and wideband versions, depending on whether you want telephone quality\\nor better.\\nSpeex is a totally free codec, licensed under the Xiph.org variant of the BSD license.\\nAn Internet draft for Speex is available, and more information about Speex can be found\\nat its home page (http://www.speex.org).\\nSpeex can operate at anywhere from 2.15 to 22.4 Kbps, due to its variable bitrate.\\n\\nSure thing, MP3 is a codec. Specifically, it\\'s the Moving Picture Experts Group Audio\\nLayer 3 Encoding Standard.# With a name like that, it\\'s no wonder we call it MP3! In\\nAsterisk, the MP3 codec is typically used for Music on Hold (MoH). MP3 is not a\\ntelephony codec, as it is optimized for music, not voice; nevertheless, it\\'s very popular\\nwith VoIP telephony systems as a method of delivering Music on Hold.\\n\\n# If you want to learn all about MPEG audio, do a web search for Davis Pan\\'s paper titled \"A Tutorial on\\n\\nMPEG/Audio Compression.\"\\n\\n196 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cBe aware that music cannot usually be broadcast without a license.\\nMany people assume that there is no legal problem with connecting a\\nradio station or CD as a Music on Hold source, but this is very rarely\\ntrue.\\n\\nQuality of Service\\nQuality of Service, or QoS as it\\'s more popularly termed, refers to the challenge of\\ndelivering a time-sensitive stream of data across a network that was designed to deliver\\ndata in an ad hoc, best-effort sort of way. Although there is no hard rule, it is generally\\naccepted that if you can deliver the sound produced by the speaker to the listener\\'s ear\\nwithin 150 milliseconds, a normal flow of conversation is possible. When delay exceeds\\n300 milliseconds, it becomes difficult to avoid interrupting each other. Beyond 500\\nmilliseconds, normal conversation becomes increasingly awkward and frustrating.\\nIn addition to getting it there on time, it is also essential to ensure that the transmitted\\ninformation arrives intact. Too many lost packets will prevent the far end from completely reproducing the sampled audio, and gaps in the data will be heard as static or,\\nin severe cases, entire missed words or sentences. Even packet loss of 5 percent can\\nseverely impede a VoIP network.\\n\\nTCP, UDP, and SCTP\\nIf you\\'re going to send data on an IP-based network, it will be transported using one\\nof the three transport protocols discussed here.\\n\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nThe Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is almost never used for VoIP, for while it\\ndoes have mechanisms in place to ensure delivery, it is not inherently in any hurry to\\ndo so. Unless you have an extremely low-latency interconnection between the two\\nendpoints, TCP will tend to cause more problems than it solves.\\nThe purpose of TCP is to guarantee the delivery of packets. In order to do this, several\\nmechanisms are implemented, such as packet numbering (for reconstructing blocks of\\ndata), delivery acknowledgment, and re-requesting lost packets. In the world of VoIP,\\ngetting the packets to the endpoint quickly is paramount--but 20 years of cellular\\ntelephony has trained us to tolerate a few lost packets.*\\n\\n* The order of arrival is important in voice communication, because the audio will be processed and sent to\\n\\nthe caller ASAP. However, with a jitter buffer the order of arrival isn\\'t as important, as it provides a small\\nwindow of time in which the packets can be reordered before being passed on to the caller.\\n\\nQuality of Service | 197\\n\\x0cTCP\\'s high processing overhead, state management, and acknowledgment of arrival\\nwork well for transmitting large amounts of data, but they simply aren\\'t efficient\\nenough for real-time media communications.\\n\\nUser Datagram Protocol\\nUnlike TCP, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not offer any sort of delivery\\nguarantee. Packets are placed on the wire as quickly as possible and released into the\\nworld to find their way to their final destinations, with no word back as to whether\\nthey got there or not. Since UDP itself does not offer any kind of guarantee that the\\ndata will arrive, it achieves its efficiency by spending very little effort on what it is\\ntransporting.\\nTCP is a more \"socially responsible\" protocol because the bandwidth\\nis more evenly distributed to clients connecting to a server. As the percentage of UDP traffic increases, it is possible that a network could\\nbecome overwhelmed.\\n\\nStream Control Transmission Protocol\\nApproved by the IETF as a proposed standard in RFC 2960, SCTP is a relatively new\\ntransport protocol. From the ground up, it was designed to address the shortcomings\\nof both TCP and UDP, especially as related to the types of services that used to be\\ndelivered over circuit-switched telephony networks.\\nSome of the goals of SCTP were:\\n Better congestion-avoidance techniques (specifically, avoiding Denial of Service\\nattacks)\\n Strict sequencing of data delivery\\n Lower latency for improved real-time transmissions\\nBy overcoming the major shortcomings of TCP and UDP, the SCTP developers hoped\\nto create a robust protocol for the transmission of SS7 and other types of PSTN signaling\\nover an IP-based network.\\n\\nDifferentiated Service\\nDifferentiated service, or DiffServ, is not so much a QoS mechanism as a method by\\nwhich traffic can be flagged and given specific treatment. Obviously, DiffServ can help\\nto provide QoS by allowing certain types of packets to take precedence over others.\\n\\n Keep in mind that the upper-layer protocols or applications can implement their own packet-\\n\\nacknowledgment systems.\\n\\n198 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cWhile this will certainly increase the chance of a VoIP packet passing quickly through\\neach link, it does not guarantee anything.\\n\\nGuaranteed Service\\nThe ultimate guarantee of QoS is provided by the PSTN. For each conversation, a 64\\nKbps channel is completely dedicated to the call; the bandwidth is guaranteed. Similarly, protocols that offer guaranteed service can ensure that a required amount of\\nbandwidth is dedicated to the connection being served. As with any packetized networking technology, these mechanisms generally operate best when traffic is below\\nmaximum levels. When a connection approaches its limits, it is next to impossible to\\neliminate degradation.\\n\\nMPLS\\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for engineering network traffic\\npatterns independent of layer-3 routing tables. The protocol works by assigning short\\nlabels (MPLS frames) to network packets, which routers then use to forward the packets\\nto the MPLS egress router, and ultimately to their final destinations. Traditionally,\\nrouters make an independent forwarding decision based on an IP table lookup at each\\nhop in the network. In an MPLS network, this lookup is performed only once, when\\nthe packet enters the MPLS cloud at the ingress router. The packet is then assigned to\\na stream, referred to as a Label Switched Path (LSP), and identified by a label. The label\\nis used as a lookup index in the MPLS forwarding table, and the packet traverses the\\nLSP independent of layer-3 routing decisions. This allows the administrators of large\\nnetworks to fine-tune routing decisions and make the best use of network resources.\\nAdditionally, information can be associated with a label to prioritize packet forwarding.\\n\\nRSVP\\nMPLS contains no method to dynamically establish LSPs, but you can use the Reservation Protocol (RSVP) with MPLS. RSVP is a signaling protocol used to simplify the\\nestablishment of LSPs and to report problems to the MPLS ingress router. The advantage of using RSVP in conjunction with MPLS is the reduction in administrative\\noverhead. If you don\\'t use RSVP with MPLS, you\\'ll have to go to every single router\\nand configure the labels and each path manually. Using RSVP makes the network more\\ndynamic by distributing control of labels to the routers. This enables the network to\\nbecome more responsive to changing conditions, because it can be set up to change the\\npaths based on certain conditions, such as a certain path going down (perhaps due to\\na faulty router). The configuration within the router will then be able to use RSVP to\\ndistribute new labels to the routers in the MPLS network, with no (or minimal) human\\nintervention.\\n\\nQuality of Service | 199\\n\\x0cBest Effort\\nThe simplest, least expensive approach to QoS is not to provide it at all--the \"best\\neffort\" method. While this might sound like a bad idea, it can in fact work very well.\\nAny VoIP call that traverses the public Internet is almost certain to be best-effort, as\\nQoS mechanisms are not yet common in this environment.\\n\\nEcho\\nYou may not realize it, but echo has been a problem in the PSTN for as long as there\\nhave been telephones. You probably haven\\'t often experienced it, because the telecom\\nindustry has spent large sums of money designing expensive echo cancellation devices.\\nAlso, when the endpoints are physically close--e.g., when you phone your neighbor\\ndown the street--the delay is so minimal that anything you transmit will be returned\\nback so quickly that it will be indistinguishable from the sidetone normally occurring\\nin your telephone. So the fact of the matter is that there is echo on your local calls much\\nof the time, but you cannot perceive it with a regular telephone because it happens\\nalmost instantaneously. It may be helpful to understand this if you consider that when\\nyou stand in a room and speak, everything you say echos back to you off of the walls\\nand ceiling (and possibly floor if it\\'s not carpeted), but does not cause any problems\\nbecause it happens so fast you do not perceive a delay.\\nThe reason that VoIP telephone systems such as Asterisk can experience echo is that\\nthe addition of a VoIP telephone introduces a slight delay. It takes a few milliseconds\\nfor the packets to travel from your phone and the server (and vice versa). Suddenly\\nthere is an appreciable delay, which allows you to perceive the echo that was always\\nthere, but never had a delay before.\\n\\nWhy Echo Occurs\\nBefore we discuss measures to deal with echo, let\\'s first take a look at why echo occurs\\nin the analog world.\\nIf you hear echo, it\\'s not your phone that\\'s causing the problem; it\\'s the far end of the\\ncircuit. Conversely, echo heard on the far end is being generated at your end. Echo can\\nbe caused by the fact that an analog local loop circuit has to transmit and receive on\\nthe same pair of wires. If this circuit is not electrically balanced, or if a low-quality\\ntelephone is connected to the end of the circuit, signals it receives can be reflected back,\\nbecoming part of the return transmission. When this reflected circuit gets back to you,\\nyou will hear the words you spoke just moments before. Humans will perceive an echo\\n\\n As discussed in Chapter 7, sidetone is a function in your telephone that returns part of what you say back to\\n\\nyour own ear, to provide a more natural-sounding conversation.\\n\\n200 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cbeyond a certain amount of delay (possibly as low as 20 milliseconds for some people).\\nThis echo will become annoying as the delay increases.\\nIn a cheap telephone, it is possible for echo to be generated in the body of the handset.\\nThis is why some cheap IP phones can cause echo even when the entire end-to-end\\nconnection does not contain an analog circuit. In the VoIP world, echo is usually\\nintroduced either by an analog circuit somewhere in the connection, or by a cheap\\nendpoint reflecting back some of the signal (e.g., feedback through a hands-free or\\npoorly designed handset or headset). The greater the latency on the network, the more\\nannoying this echo can be.\\n\\nManaging Echo on Zaptel Channels\\nIn the zconfig.h configuration file, you can choose from one of several echo-canceller\\nalgorithms, with the default being MARK2. Experiment with the various echo cancellers on your network to determine the best one for your environment. Asterisk also has\\nan option in the zconfig.h file to make the echo cancellation more aggressive. You can\\nenable it by uncommenting the following line:\\n#define AGGRESSIVE_SUPPRESSOR\\n\\nNote that aggressive echo cancellation can create a walkie-talkie, half-duplex effect. It\\nshould be enabled only if all other methods of reducing echo have failed.\\nEnable echo cancellation for Zaptel interfaces in the zapata.conf file. The default configuration enables echo cancellation with echocancel=yes. echocancelwhenbridged=yes\\nwill enable echo cancellation for TDM bridged calls. While bridged calls should not\\nrequire echo cancellation, this may improve call quality.\\nWhen echo cancellation is enabled, the echo canceller learns of echo on the line by\\nlistening for it for the duration of the call. Consequently, echo may be heard at the\\nbeginning of a call and eventually lessen after a period of time. To avoid this situation,\\nyou can employ a method called echo training, which will mute the line briefly at the\\nbeginning of a call, and then send a tone from which the amount of echo on the line\\ncan be determined. This allows Asterisk to deal with the echo more quickly. Echo\\ntraining can be enabled with echotraining=yes.\\n\\nHardware Echo Cancellation\\nThe most effective way to handle echo cancellation is not in software. If you are planning on deploying a good quality system, spend the extra money and purchase cards\\nfor the system that have onboard hardware echo cancellation. These cards are somewhat more expensive, but they quickly pay for themselves in terms of reduced load on\\nthe CPU, as well as reduced load on you due to less user complaints.\\n\\n Actually, the handset in any phone, be it traditional or VoIP, is an analog connection.\\n\\nEcho | 201\\n\\x0cAsterisk and VoIP\\nIt should come as no surprise that Asterisk loves to talk VoIP. But in order to do so,\\nAsterisk needs to know which function it is to perform: that of client, server, or both.\\nOne of the most complex and often confusing concepts in Asterisk is the naming\\nscheme of inbound and outbound authentication.\\n\\nUsers and Peers and Friends--Oh My!\\nConnections that authenticate to us, or that we authenticate, are defined in the\\niax.conf and sip.conf files as users and peers. Connections that do both may be defined\\nas friends. When determining which way the authentication is occurring, it is always\\nimportant to view the direction of the channels from Asterisk\\'s viewpoint, as connections are being accepted and created by the Asterisk server.\\n\\nUsers\\nA connection defined as a user is any system/user/endpoint that we allow to connect\\nto us. Keep in mind that a user definition does not provide a method with which to call\\nthat user; the user type is used simply to create a channel for incoming calls. A user\\ndefinition will require a context name to be defined to indicate where the incoming\\nauthenticated call will enter the dialplan (in extensions.conf).\\n\\nPeers\\nA connection defined as a peer type is an outgoing connection. Think of it this way:\\nusers place calls to us, while we place calls to our peers. Since peers do not place calls\\nto us, a peer definition does not typically require the configuration of a context name.\\nHowever, there is one exception: if calls that originate from your system are returned\\nto your system in a loopback, the incoming calls (which originate from a SIP proxy,\\nnot a user agent) will be matched on the peer definition. The default context should\\nhandle these incoming calls appropriately, although it\\'s preferable for contexts to be\\ndefined for them on a per-peer basis.#\\nIn order to know where to send a call to a host, we must know its location in relation\\nto the Internet (that is, its IP address). The location of a peer may be defined either\\nstatically or dynamically. A dynamic peer is configured with host=dynamic under the\\npeer definition heading. Because the IP address of a dynamic peer may change\\n\\n In SIP, this is not always the case. If the endpoint is a SIP proxy service (as opposed to a user agent), Asterisk\\n\\nwill authenticate based on the peer definition, matching the IP address and port in the Contact field of the\\nSIP header against the hostname (and port, if specified) defined for the peer (if the port is not specified, the\\none defined in the [general] section will be used). See the discussion of the SIP insecure option in\\nAppendix A for more on this subject.\\n# For more information on this topic, see the discussion of the SIP context option in Appendix A.\\n\\n202 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\n\\nUser\\n\\nAsterisk\\n\\nPeer\\n\\nAsterisk\\n\\nFriend\\n\\nFigure 8-2. Call origination relationships of users, peers, and friends to Asterisk\\n\\nconstantly, it must register with the Asterisk box to let it know what its IP address is,\\nso calls can successfully be routed to it. If the remote end is another Asterisk box, the\\nuse of a register statement is required, as discussed below.\\n\\nFriends\\nDefining a type as a friend is a shortcut for defining it as both a user and a peer.\\nHowever, connections that are both a user and a peer aren\\'t always defined this way,\\nbecause defining each direction of call creation individually (using both a user and a\\npeer definition) allows more granularity and control over the individual connections.\\nFigure 8-2 shows the flow of authentication control in relation to Asterisk.\\n\\nregister Statements\\nA register statement is a way of telling a remote peer where your Asterisk box is in\\nrelation to the Internet. Asterisk uses register statements to authenticate to remote\\nproviders when you are employing a dynamic IP address, or when the provider does\\nnot have your IP address on record. There are situations when a register statement is\\nnot required, but to demonstrate when a register statement is required, let\\'s look at\\nan example.\\nSay you have a remote peer that is providing DID services to you. When someone calls\\nthe number +1-800-555-1212, the call goes over the physical PSTN network to your\\nservice provider and into its Asterisk server, possibly over its T1 connection. This call\\nis then routed to your Asterisk server via the Internet.\\n\\nAsterisk and VoIP | 203\\n\\x0cYour service provider will have a definition in either its sip.conf or iax.conf configuration\\nfile (depending on whether you are connecting with the SIP or IAX protocol, respectively) for your Asterisk server. If you receive calls only from this provider, you would\\ndefine them as a user (if it was another Asterisk system, you might be defined in its\\nsystem as a peer).\\nNow let\\'s say that your box is on your home Internet connection, with a dynamic IP\\naddress. Your service provider has a static IP address (or perhaps a fully qualified domain name), which you place in your configuration file. Since you have a dynamic\\naddress, your service provider specifies host=dynamic in its configuration file. In order\\nto know where to route your +1-800-555-1212 call, your service provider needs to know\\nwhere you are located in relation to the Internet. This is where the register statement\\ncomes into use.\\nThe register statement is a way of authenticating and telling your peer where you are.\\nIn the [general] section of your configuration file, you place a statement similar to this:\\nregister => username:secret@my_remote_peer\\n\\nYou can verify a successful register with the use of the iax2 show registry and sip show\\nregistry commands at the Asterisk console.\\n\\nVoIP Security\\nIn this book we can barely scratch the surface of the complex matter of VoIP security;\\ntherefore before we dig in, we want to steer you in the direction of the VoIP Security\\nAlliance (http://www.voipsa.org). This fantastic resource contains an excellent mailing\\nlist, white papers, howtos, and a general compendium of all matters relating to VoIP\\nsecurity. Just as email has been abused by the selfish and criminal, so too will voice.\\nThe fine folks at VoIPSA are doing what they can to ensure that we address these\\nchallenges now, before they become an epidemic. In the realm of books on the subject,\\nwe recommend the most excellent Hacking Exposed VoIP by David Endler and Mark\\nCollier (McGraw-Hill Osborne Media). If you are responsible for deploying any VoIP\\nsystem, you need to be aware of this stuff.\\n\\nSpam over Internet Telephony (SPIT)\\nWe don\\'t want to think about this, but we know it\\'s coming. The simple fact is that\\nthere are people in this world who lack certain social skills, and, coupled with a kind\\nof mindless greed, these folks think nothing of flooding the Internet with massive volumes of email. These same types of characters will similarly think little of doing the\\nsame with voice. We already know what it\\'s like to get flooded with telemarketing calls;\\ntry to imagine what happens when it costs the telemarketer almost nothing to send\\nvoice spam. Regulation has not stopped email spam, and it will probably not stop voice\\nspam, so it will be up to us to prevent it.\\n\\n204 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0cEncrypting Audio with Secure RTP\\nIf you can sniff the packets coming out of an Asterisk system, you can extract the audio\\nfrom the RTP streams. This data can be fed offline to a speech processing system, which\\ncan listen for keywords such as \"credit card number\" or \"PIN\", and present that data\\nto someone who has an interest in it. The stream can also be evaluated to see if there\\nare DTMF tones embedded in it, which is dangerous because many services ask for\\npassword and credit card information input via the dialpad. In business, strategic information could also be gleaned from being able to capture and evaluate audio.\\nUsing Secure RTP can combat this problem by encrypting the RTP streams; however,\\nAsterisk does not support SRTP as of this writing. Work is under way to provide SRTP\\nsupport (a patch exists in the trunk release, but it is not known as of this writing whether\\nthis will be back-ported to 1.4).\\n\\nSpoofing\\nIn the traditional telephone network, it is very difficult to successfully adopt someone\\nelse\\'s identity. Your activities can (and will) be traced back to you, and the authorities\\nwill quickly put an end to the fun. In the world of IP, it is much easier to remain\\nanonymous. As such, it is no stretch to imagine that hordes of enterprising criminals\\nwill only be too happy to make calls to your credit card company or bank, pretending\\nto be you. If a trusted mechanism is not discovered to combat spoofing, we will quickly\\nlearn that we cannot trust VoIP calls.\\n\\nWhat Can Be Done?\\nThe first thing to keep in mind when considering security on a VoIP system is that VoIP\\nis based on network protocols, and needs be evaluated from that perspective. This is\\nnot to say that traditional telecom security should be ignored, but we need to pay\\nattention to the underlying network.\\n\\nBasic network security\\nOne of the most effective things that can be done is to secure access to the voice network.\\nThe use of firewalls and VLANs are examples of how this can be achieved. By default,\\nthe voice network should be accessible only to those things that have a need. For example, if you do not have any softphones in use, do not allow client PCs access to the\\nvoice network.\\nSegregating voice and data traffic. Unless there is a need to have voice and data on the same\\nnetwork, there may be some value in keeping them separate (this can have other benefits\\nas well, such as simplifying QoS configurations). It is not unheard of to build the internal voice network on a totally separate LAN, using existing CAT3 cabling and\\nterminating on inexpensive network switches. It can be less expensive too.\\n\\nVoIP Security | 205\\n\\x0cDMZ. Placing your VoIP system in a DMZ can provide an additional layer of protection\\nfor your LAN, while still allowing connectivity for relevant applications. Should your\\nVoIP system be compromised, it will be much more difficult to use it to launch an attack\\non the rest of your network, since it is not trusted. Regardless of whether you deploy\\nwithin a DMZ, any abnormal traffic coming out of the system should be suspect.\\nServer hardening. Hardening your Asterisk server is critical. Not only are there performance benefits to doing this (running nonessential processes can eat up valuable CPU\\nand RAM), the elimination of anything not required will reduce the chance that an\\nexploited vulnerability in the operating system can be used to gain access and launch\\nan attack on other parts of your network.\\nRunning Asterisk as non-root is an essential part of system hardening. See Chapter 11 for more information.\\n\\nEncryption\\nEven though Asterisk does not yet fully support SRTP, it is still possible to encrypt VoIP\\ntraffic. For example, between sites a VPN could be employed. Consideration should\\nbe given to the performance cost of this, but in general this can be a very effective way\\nto secure VoIP traffic and it is relatively simple to implement.\\n\\nPhysical security\\nPhysical security should not be ignored. All terminating equipment (such as switches,\\nrouters, and the PBX itself) should be secured in an environment that can only be\\naccessed by authorized persons. At the user end (such as under desks), it can be more\\ndifficult to deliver physical security, but if the network responds only to devices that it\\nis familiar with (such as restricting DHCP to devices whose MAC is known), unauthorized intrusion can be mitigated somewhat.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf you listen to the buzz in the telecom industry, you might think that VoIP is the future\\nof telephony. But to Asterisk, VoIP is more a case of \"been there, done that.\" For Asterisk, the future of telephony is much more exciting. We\\'ll take a look at that vision a\\nbit later, in Chapter 15. In the next chapter, we are going to delve into one of the more\\nrevolutionary and powerful concepts of Asterisk: AGI, the Asterisk Gateway Interface.\\n\\n206 | Chapter 8: Protocols for VoIP\\n\\x0c\\nThe Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\nEven he, to whom most things that most people would\\nthink were pretty smart were pretty dumb, thought it\\nwas pretty smart.\\n--Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt\\n\\nThe Asterisk Gateway Interface, or AGI, provides a standard interface by which external\\nprograms may control the Asterisk dialplan. Usually, AGI scripts are used to do advanced logic, communicate with relational databases (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL),\\nand access other external resources. Turning over control of the dialplan to an external\\nAGI script enables Asterisk to easily perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult or\\nimpossible.\\nThis chapter covers the fundamentals of AGI communication. It will not teach you how\\nto be a programmer--rather, we\\'ll assume that you\\'re already a competent programmer, so that we can show you how to write AGI programs. If you don\\'t know how to\\ndo computer programming, this chapter probably isn\\'t for you, and you should skip\\nahead to the next chapter.\\nOver the course of this chapter, we\\'ll write a sample AGI program in each of the Perl,\\nPHP, and Python programming languages. Note, however, that because Asterisk provides a standard interface for AGI scripts, these scripts can be written in almost any\\nmodern programming language. We\\'ve chosen to highlight Perl, PHP, and Python because they\\'re the languages most commonly used for AGI programming.\\n\\nFundamentals of AGI Communication\\nInstead of releasing an API for programming, AGI scripts communicate with Asterisk\\nover communications channels (file handles, in programming parlance) known as\\nSTDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. Most computer programmers will recognize these channels,\\nbut just in case you\\'re not familiar with them, we\\'ll cover them here.\\n\\n\\x0cWhat Are STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR?\\nSTDIN , STDOUT , and STDERR are channels by which programs in Unix-like environments\\nreceive information from and send information to external programs. STDIN, or\\nstandard input, is the information that is sent to the program, either from the keyboard\\nor from another program. In our case, information coming from Asterisk itself comes\\nin on the program\\'s STDIN file handle. STDOUT, or standard output, is the file handle that\\nthe AGI script uses to pass information back to Asterisk. Finally, the AGI script can\\nuse the STDERR (standard error) file handle to write error messages to the Asterisk\\nconsole.\\n\\nLet\\'s sum up these three communications concepts:\\n An AGI script reads from STDIN to get information from Asterisk.\\n An AGI script writes data to STDOUT to send information to Asterisk.\\n An AGI script may write data to STDERR to send debug information to the Asterisk\\nconsole.\\nAt this time, writing to STDERR from within your AGI script writes the\\ninformation only to the first Asterisk console--that is, the first Asterisk\\nconsole started with the -c parameters.\\nThis is rather unfortunate, and will hopefully be remedied soon by the\\nAsterisk developers.\\nIf you\\'re using the safe_asterisk program to start Asterisk (which you\\nprobably are), it starts a remote console on TTY9. (Try pressing CtrlAlt-F9, and see if you get an Asterisk command-line interface.) This\\nmeans that all of the AGI debug information will print on only that\\nremote console. You may want to disable this console in safe_asterisk\\nto allow you to see the debug information in another console. (You may\\nalso want to disable that console for security reasons, as you might not\\nwant just anyone to be able to walk up to your Asterisk server and have\\naccess to a console without any kind of authentication.)\\n\\nThe Standard Pattern of AGI Communication\\nThe communication between Asterisk and an AGI script follows a predefined pattern.\\nLet\\'s enumerate the steps, and then we\\'ll walk through one of the sample AGI scripts\\nthat come with Asterisk.\\nWhen an AGI script starts, Asterisk sends a list of variables and their values to the AGI\\nscript. The variables might look something like this:\\nagi_request: test.py\\nagi_language: en\\nagi_callerid:\\nagi_context: default\\n\\n208 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0c\\nAfter sending these variables, Asterisk sends a blank line. This is the signal that Asterisk\\nis done sending the variables, and it is time for the AGI script to control the dialplan.\\nAt this point, the AGI script sends commands to Asterisk by writing to STDOUT. After\\nthe script sends each command, Asterisk sends a response that the AGI script should\\nread. These actions (sending commands to Asterisk and reading the responses) can\\ncontinue for the duration of the AGI script.\\nYou may be asking yourself what commands you can use from within your AGI script.\\nGood question--we\\'ll cover the basic commands shortly.*\\n\\nCalling an AGI Script from the Dialplan\\nIn order to work properly, your AGI script must be executable. To use an AGI script\\ninside your dialplan, simply call the AGI() application, with the name of the AGI script\\nas the argument, like this:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,AGI(agi-test.agi)\\n\\nAGI scripts often reside in the AGI directory (usually located\\nin /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin), but you can specify the complete path to the AGI script.\\n\\nAGI(), EAGI(), DeadAGI(), and FastAGI()\\nIn addition to the AGI() application, there are several other AGI applications suited to\\ndifferent circumstances. While they won\\'t be covered in this chapter, they should be\\nquite simple to figure out once you understand the basics of AGI scripting.\\nThe EAGI() (enhanced AGI) application acts just like AGI() but allows your AGI script\\nto read the inbound audio stream on file descriptor number three.\\nThe DeadAGI() application is also just like AGI(), but it works correctly on a channel\\nthat is dead (i.e., a channel that has been hung up). As this implies, the regular AGI()\\napplication doesn\\'t work on dead channels.\\nThe FastAGI() application allows the AGI script to be called across the network, so that\\nmultiple Asterisk servers can call AGI scripts from a central location.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we\\'ll first cover the sample agi-test.agi script that comes with Asterisk\\n(which was written in Perl), then write a weather report AGI program in PHP, and finish\\nup by writing an AGI program in Python to play a math game.\\n* To get a list of available AGI commands, type show agi at the Asterisk command-line interface. You can also\\n\\nrefer to Appendix C for an AGI command reference.\\n\\nFundamentals of AGI Communication | 209\\n\\x0cWriting AGI Scripts in Perl\\nAsterisk comes with a sample AGI script called agi-test.agi. Let\\'s step through the file\\nwhile we cover the core concepts of AGI programming. While this particular script is\\nwritten in Perl, please remember that your own AGI programs may be written in almost\\nany programming language. Just to prove it, we\\'re going to cover AGI programming in\\na couple of other languages later in the chapter.\\nLet\\'s get started! We\\'ll look at each section of the code in turn, and describe what it\\ndoes:\\n#!/usr/bin/perl\\n\\nThis line tells the system that this particular script is written in Perl, so it should use\\nthe Perl interpreter to execute the script. If you\\'ve done much Linux or Unix scripting,\\nthis line should be familiar to you. This line assumes, of course, that your Perl binary\\nis located in the /usr/bin/ directory. Change this to match the location of your Perl\\ninterpreter.\\nuse strict;\\n\\nuse strict tells Perl to act, well, strict about possible programming errors, such as\\n\\nundeclared variables. While not absolutely necessary, enabling this will help you avoid\\ncommon programming pitfalls.\\n\\nThis line tells Perl not to buffer its output--in other words, that it should write any\\ndata immediately, instead of waiting for a block of data before outputting it. You\\'ll see\\nthis as a recurring theme throughout the chapter.\\n# Set up some variables\\nmy %AGI; my $tests = 0; my $fail = 0; my $pass = 0;\\n\\nYou should always use unbuffered output when writing AGI scripts.\\nOtherwise, your AGI may not work as expected, because Asterisk may\\nbe waiting for the output of your program, while your program thinks\\nit has sent the output to Asterisk and is waiting for a response.\\n\\nHere, we set up four variables. The first is a hash called AGI, which is used to store the\\nvariables that Asterisk passes to our script at the beginning of the AGI session. The next\\nthree are scalar values, used to count the total number of tests, the number of failed\\ntests, and the number of passed tests, respectively.\\nwhile(<STDIN>) {\\nchomp;\\nlast unless length($_);\\nif (/^agi_(\\\\w+)\\\\:\\\\s+(.*)$/) {\\n}\\n}\\n\\n210 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cAs we explained earlier, Asterisk sends a group of variables to the AGI program at\\nstartup. This loop simply takes all of these variables and stores them in the hash named\\nAGI. They can be used later in the program or simply ignored, but they should always\\nbe read from STDIN before continuing on with the logic of the program.\\nprint STDERR \"AGI Environment Dump:\\\\n\";\\nforeach my $i (sort keys %AGI) {\\nprint STDERR \" -- $i = $AGI{$i}\\\\n\";\\n}\\n\\nThis loop simply writes each of the values that we stored in the AGI hash to STDERR. This\\nis useful for debugging the AGI script, as STDERR is printed to the Asterisk console.\\nsub checkresult {\\nmy ($res) = @_;\\nmy $retval;\\n$tests++;\\nchomp $res;\\nif ($res =~ /^200/) {\\n$res =~ /result=(-?\\\\d+)/;\\nif (!length($1)) {\\nprint STDERR \"FAIL ($res)\\\\n\";\\n$fail++;\\n} else {\\nprint STDERR \"PASS ($1)\\\\n\";\\n$pass++;\\n}\\n} else {\\nprint STDERR \"FAIL (unexpected result \\'$res\\')\\\\n\";\\n$fail++;\\n}\\n\\nThis subroutine reads in the result of an AGI command from Asterisk and decodes the\\nresult to determine whether the command passes or fails.\\nNow that the preliminaries are out of the way, we can get to the core logic of the AGI\\nscript:\\nprint STDERR \"1. Testing \\'sendfile\\'...\";\\nprint \"STREAM FILE beep \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis first test shows how to use the STREAM FILE command. The STREAM FILE command\\ntells Asterisk to play a sound file to the caller, just as the Background() application does.\\nIn this case, we\\'re telling Asterisk to play a file called beep.gsm.\\n\\n Actually, to the first spawned Asterisk console (i.e., the first instance of Asterisk called with the -c option).\\n\\nIf safe_asterisk was used to start Asterisk, the first Asterisk console will be on TTY9, which means that you\\nwill not be able to view AGI errors remotely.\\n Asterisk automatically selects the best format, based on translation cost and availability, so the file extension\\n\\nis never used in the function.\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Perl | 211\\n\\x0cYou will notice that the second argument is passed by putting in a set of double quotes,\\nescaped by backslashes. Without the double quotes to indicate the second argument,\\nthis command does not work correctly.\\nYou must pass all required arguments to the AGI commands. If you want\\nto skip a required argument, you must send empty quotes (properly\\nescaped in your particular programming language), as shown above. If\\nyou don\\'t pass the required number of arguments, your AGI script will\\nnot work.\\nYou should also make sure you pass a line feed (the \\\\n on the end of the\\nprint statement) at the end of the command.\\n\\nAfter sending the STREAM FILE command, this test reads the result from STDIN and calls\\nthe checkresult subroutine to determine if Asterisk was able to play the file. The STREAM\\nFILE command takes three arguments, two of which are required:\\n The name of the sound file to play back\\n The digits that may interrupt the playback\\n The position at which to start playing the sound, specified in number of samples\\n(optional)\\nIn short, this test told Asterisk to play back the file named beep.gsm, and then it checked\\nthe result to make sure the command was successfully executed by Asterisk.\\nprint STDERR \"2. Testing \\'sendtext\\'...\";\\nprint \"SEND TEXT \\\\\"hello world\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test shows us how to call the SEND TEXT command, which is similar to the\\nSendText() application. This command will send the specified text to the caller, if the\\ncaller\\'s channel type supports the sending of text.\\nThe SEND TEXT command takes one argument: the text to send to the channel. If the\\ntext contains spaces (as in the previous code block), the argument should be encapsulated with quotes, so that Asterisk will know that the entire text string is a single\\nargument to the command. Again, notice that the quotation marks are escaped, as they\\nmust be sent to Asterisk, not used to terminate the string in Perl.\\nprint STDERR \"3. Testing \\'sendimage\\'...\";\\nprint \"SEND IMAGE asterisk-image\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test calls the SEND IMAGE command, which is similar to the SendImage() application.\\nIts single argument is the name of an image file to send to the caller. As with the SEND\\nTEXT command, this command works only if the calling channel supports the receiving\\nimages.\\n\\n212 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cprint STDERR \"4. Testing \\'saynumber\\'...\";\\nprint \"SAY NUMBER 192837465 \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test sends Asterisk the SAY NUMBER command. This command behaves identically\\nto the SayNumber() dialplan application. It takes two arguments:\\n The number to say\\n The digits that may interrupt the command\\nAgain, since we\\'re not passing in any digits as the second argument, we need to pass\\nin an empty set of quotes.\\nprint STDERR \"5. Testing \\'waitdtmf\\'...\";\\nprint \"WAIT FOR DIGIT 1000\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis test shows the WAIT FOR DIGIT command. This command waits the specified number of milliseconds for the caller to enter a DTMF digit. If you want the command to\\nwait indefinitely for a digit, use -1 as the timeout. This application returns the decimal\\nASCII value of the digit that was pressed.\\nprint STDERR \"6. Testing \\'record\\'...\";\\nprint \"RECORD FILE testagi gsm 1234 3000\\\\n\";\\nmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThis section of code shows us the RECORD FILE command. This command is used to\\nrecord the call audio, similar to the Record() dialplan application. RECORD FILE takes\\nseven arguments, the last three of which are optional:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe filename of the recorded file.\\nThe format in which to record the audio.\\nThe digits that may interrupt the recording.\\nThe timeout (maximum recording time) in milliseconds, or -1 for no timeout.\\nThe number of samples to skip before starting the recording (optional).\\nThe word BEEP, if you\\'d like Asterisk to beep before the recording starts (optional).\\nThe number of seconds before Asterisk decides that the user is done with the recording and returns, even though the timeout hasn\\'t been reached and no DTMF\\ndigits have been entered (optional). This argument must be preceded by s=.\\n\\nIn this particular case, we\\'re recording a file called testagi (in the GSM format), with\\nany of the DTMF digits 1 through 4 terminating the recording, and a maximum recording time of 3,000 milliseconds.\\nprint STDERR \"6a. Testing \\'record\\' playback...\";\\nprint \"STREAM FILE testagi \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\";\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Perl | 213\\n\\x0cmy $result = <STDIN>;\\n&checkresult($result);\\n\\nThe second part of this test plays back the audio that was recorded earlier, using the\\nSTREAM FILE command. We\\'ve already covered STREAM FILE, so this section of code\\nneeds no further explanation.\\nprint STDERR \"================== Complete ======================\\\\n\";\\nprint STDERR \"$tests tests completed, $pass passed, $fail failed\\\\n\";\\nprint STDERR \"==================================================\\\\n\";\\n\\nAt the end of the AGI script, a summary of the tests is printed to STDERR, which should\\nend up on the Asterisk console.\\nIn summary, you should remember the following when writing AGI programs in Perl:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurn on strict language checking with the use strict command.\\nTurn off output buffering by setting $|=1.\\nData from Asterisk is received using a while(<STDIN>) loop.\\nWrite values with the print command.\\nUse the print STDERR command to write debug information to the Asterisk console.\\n\\nThe Perl AGI Library\\nIf you are interested in building your own AGI scripts in Perl, you may want to check\\nout the Asterisk::AGI Perl module written by James Golovich, which is located at http://\\nasterisk.gnuinter.net. The Asterisk::AGI module makes it even easier to write AGI\\nscripts in Perl.\\n\\nCreating AGI Scripts in PHP\\nWe promised we\\'d cover several languages, so let\\'s go ahead and see what an AGI script\\nin PHP looks like. The fundamentals of AGI programming still apply; only the programming language has changed. In this example, we\\'ll write an AGI script to download\\na weather report from the Internet and deliver the temperature, wind direction, and\\nwind speed back to the caller:\\n#!/usr/bin/php -q\\n<?php\\n\\nThe first line tells the system to use the PHP interpreter to run this script. The -q option\\nturns off HTML error messages. You should ensure that there aren\\'t any extra lines\\nbetween the first line and the opening PHP tag, as they\\'ll confuse Asterisk.\\n# change this to match the code of your particular city\\n# for a complete list of U.S. cities, go to\\n\\n This advice probably applies to any Perl program you might write, especially if you\\'re new to Perl.\\n\\n214 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0c# http://www.nws.noaa.gov/data/current_obs/\\n$weatherURL=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/data/current_obs/KMDQ.xml\";\\n\\nThis tells our AGI script where to go to get the current weather conditions.

The following\\nthings should be remembered when writing an AGI script in PHP:\\n Invoke PHP with the -q switch; it turns off HTML in error messages.\\n Turn off the time limit, or set it to a reasonable value (newer versions of PHP\\nautomatically disable the time limit when PHP is invoked from the command line).\\n Turn off output buffering with the ob_implicit_flush(false) command.\\n Open file handles to STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR (newer versions of PHP may have\\none or more of these file handles already opened; see the previous code for a slick\\nway of making this work across most versions of PHP).\\n Read variables from STDIN using the fgets function.\\n Use the fwrite function to write to STDOUT and STDERR.\\n Always call the fflush function after writing to either STDOUT or STDERR.\\n\\nThe PHP AGI Library\\nFor advanced AGI programming in PHP, you may want to check out the PHPAGI\\nproject at http://phpagi.sourceforge.net. It was originally written by Matthew Asham\\nand is being developed by several other members of the Asterisk community.\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Python\\nThe AGI script we\\'ll be writing in Python, called \"The Subtraction Game,\" was inspired\\nby a Perl program written by Ed Guy and discussed by him at the 2004 AstriCon conference. Ed described his enthusiasm for the power and simplicity of Asterisk when he\\n\\nWriting AGI Scripts in Python | 219\\n\\x0cfound he could write a quick Perl script to help his young daughter improve her math\\nskills.\\nSince we\\'ve already written a Perl program using AGI, and Ed has already written the\\nmath program in Perl, we figured we\\'d take a stab at it in Python!\\nLet\\'s go through our Python script:\\n#!/usr/bin/python\\n\\nThis line tells the system to run this script in the Python interpreter. For small scripts,\\nyou may consider adding the -u option to this line, which will run Python in unbuffered\\nmode.

Don\\'t forget\\nto call sys.stdout.flush after writing.\\n\\nThe Python AGI Library\\nIf you are planning on writing lot of Python AGI code, you may want to check out Karl\\nPutland\\'s Python module, Pyst. You can find it at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/\\npyst/.\\n\\nDebugging in AGI\\nDebugging AGI programs, as with any other type of program, can be frustrating. Luckily, there are two advantages to debugging AGI scripts. First, since all of the communications between Asterisk and the AGI program happen over STDIN and STDOUT (and,\\nof course, STDERR), you should be able to run your AGI script directly from the operating\\nsystem. Second, Asterisk has a handy command for showing all of the communications\\nbetween itself and the AGI script: agi debug.\\n\\nDebugging from the Operating System\\nAs mentioned above, you should be able to run your program directly from the operating system to see how it behaves. The secret here is to act just like Asterisk does,\\nproviding your script with the following:\\n A list of variables and their values, such as agi_test:1.\\n A blank line feed (\\\\n) to indicate that you\\'re done passing variables.\\n Responses to each of the AGI commands from your AGI script. Usually, typing\\n200 response=1 is sufficient.\\n\\nDebugging in AGI | 223\\n\\x0cTrying your program directly from the operating system may help you to more easily\\nspot bugs in your program.\\n\\nUsing Asterisk\\'s agi debug Command\\nThe Asterisk command-line interface has a very useful command for debugging AGI\\nscripts, which is called (appropriately enough) agi debug. If you type agi debug at an\\nAsterisk console and then run an AGI, you\\'ll see something like the following:\\n-- Executing AGI(\"Zap/1-1\", \"temperature.php\") in new stack\\n-- Launched AGI Script /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/temperature.php\\nAGI Tx >> agi_request: temperature.php\\nAGI Tx >> agi_channel: Zap/1-1\\nAGI Tx >> agi_language: en\\nAGI Tx >> agi_type: Zap\\nAGI Tx >> agi_uniqueid: 1116732890.8\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callerid: 101\\nAGI Tx >> agi_calleridname: Tom Jones\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingpres: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingani2: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callington: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_callingtns: 0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_dnid: unknown\\nAGI Tx >> agi_rdnis: unknown\\nAGI Tx >> agi_context: incoming\\nAGI Tx >> agi_extension: 141\\nAGI Tx >> agi_priority: 2\\nAGI Tx >> agi_enhanced: 0.0\\nAGI Tx >> agi_accountcode:\\nAGI Tx >>\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE temperature \"\"\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE is \"\"\\nAGI Rx << SAY NUMBER 67 \"\"\\n-- Playing \\'digits/60\\' (language \\'en\\')\\n-- Playing \\'digits/7\\' (language \\'en\\')\\nAGI Tx >> 200 result=0\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE degrees \"\"\\nAGI Rx << STREAM FILE fahrenheit \"\"\\n-- AGI Script temperature.php completed, returning 0\\n\\nYou\\'ll see three types of lines while your AGI script is running. The first type, prefaced\\nwith AGI TX >>, are the lines that Asterisk transmits to your program\\'s STDIN. The second\\ntype, prefaced with AGI RX <<, are the commands your AGI program writes back to\\nAsterisk over STDOUT. The third type, prefaced by --, are the standard Asterisk messages\\npresented as it executes certain commands.\\nTo disable AGI debugging after it has been started, simply type agi no debug at an\\nAsterisk console.\\n\\n224 | Chapter 9: The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI)\\n\\x0cUsing the agi debug command will enable you to see the communication between\\nAsterisk and your program, which can be very useful when debugging. Hopefully, these\\ntwo tips will greatly improve your ability to write and debug powerful AGI programs.\\n\\nConclusion\\nFor a developer, AGI is one of the more revolutionary and compelling reasons to choose\\nAsterisk over a closed, proprietary PBX. Still, AGI is only part of the picture. In Chapter 10, we\\'ll explore another powerful programming interface known as the Asterisk\\nManager Interface.\\n\\nConclusion | 225\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nAsterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and\\nAdhearsion\\n\\nDo but take care to express yourself in a plain, easy\\nManner, in well-chosen, significant and decent Terms,\\nand to give a harmonious and pleasing Turn to your\\nPeriods: study to explain your Thoughts, and set them\\nin the truest Light, labouring as much as possible, not\\nto leave them dark nor intricate, but clear and\\nintelligible.\\n--Miguel de Cervantes, Preface to Don Quixote\\n\\nThe Manager Interface\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) is a powerful programmatic interface. It allows\\nexternal programs to both control and monitor an Asterisk system.* This interface is\\noften used to integrate Asterisk with existing business processes and systems, CRM\\n(Customer Relationship Management) software. It can also be used for a wide variety\\nof applications, such as automated dialers and click-to-call systems.\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface listens for connections on a network port. A client\\nprogram can then connect to the Asterisk Manager Interface on that port, authenticate\\nitself, and send commands to Asterisk. Asterisk will then respond to the request, as\\nwell as update the client program with the status of the system.\\nTo use the Manager, you must define an account\\nfile /etc/asterisk/manager.conf. This file will look something like this:\\n\\nin\\n\\nthe\\n\\n[general]\\nenabled = yes\\nport = 5038\\n* Contrast this with the Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI), which allows Asterisk to launch an external program\\n\\nfrom the dialplan. The AGI and AMI interfaces are very much complimentary to each other.\\n\\n\\x0cbindaddr = 0.0.0.0\\n[oreilly]\\nsecret = notvery\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user\\n\\nIn the [general] section, you have to enable the service by setting the parameter enabled\\n= yes. You will need to reload the Manager in order to have this change take effect\\n(module reload manager from the Asterisk console). The TCP port defaults to 5038.\\nNext, you create a section for each user that will authenticate to the system. For each\\nuser, you will specify the username in square brackets ([ ]), followed by the password\\nfor that user (secret), any IP addresses you wish to deny access to, any IP addresses you\\nwish to permit access to, and the read and write permissions for that user.\\nIt is very important to understand that other than a clear text password\\nand the ability to restrict IP addresses, there is no security of any kind\\non the Manager interface. If you are running Manager on an untrusted\\nnetwork (or have any other complex needs), you should consider using\\nDavid Troy\\'s excellent AstManProxy to handle all of your connections\\nto the manager API.\\n\\nConnecting to the Manager Interface\\nIt is important to keep in mind that the Manager interface is designed to be used by\\nprograms, not fingers. That\\'s not to say that you can\\'t issue commands to it directly--\\njust don\\'t expect a typical console interface, because that\\'s not what Manager is for.\\nCommands to Manager are delivered in packages with the following syntax (lines are\\nterminated with CR+LF):\\nAction: <action type>\\netc ...\\nVariable: Value\\nVariable: Value\\netc...\\n\\nFor example, to authenticate with Manager (which is required if you expect to have\\nany interaction whatsoever), you would send the following:\\n\\n Carriage Return followed by Line Feed. This is popularly achieved by pressing the Enter key on the keyboard,\\n\\nbut there are differences across various OS platforms and programming languages, so if you are having trouble\\nwith commands to the interface, it may be worth noting the exact character combination that is required. At\\nthe time of writing, Wikipedia had a respectable writeup on this concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\nNewline).\\n\\n228 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cAction: login\\nUsername: oreilly\\nSecret: notvery\\n<CR+LF>\\n\\nAn extra CR+LF on a blank line will submit the entire package to Manager.\\nOnce authenticated, you will be able to initiate actions, as well as see events generated\\nby Asterisk. On a busy system, this can get quite complicated and become totally impossible to keep track of with the unaided eye. To turn keep Asterisk from sending\\nevents, you can add the Events parameter to your login command, like this:\\nAction: login\\nUsername: oreilly\\nSecret: notvery\\nEvents: off\\n<CR+LF>\\n\\nIf you\\'re worried about sending your secret across the wire in plain text (which you\\nshould be), you can also authenticate using an MD5 challenge-response system, which\\nworks very similar to HTTP digest authentication. To do this, you first call the\\nChallenge action, which will present you with a challenge token:\\nAction: Challenge\\nResponse: Success\\n\\nYou can then take that challenge token, concatenate the plaintext secret onto the end\\nof it, and calculate the MD5 checksum of the resulting string. The result can then be\\nused to login without passing your secret in plain text.\\nAction: Login\\nUsername: Admin\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Authentication accepted\\n\\nSending Commands\\nOnce you\\'ve successfully logged into the AMI system, you can send commands to\\nAsterisk by using the other actions. We\\'ll show a few commands here so that you can\\nget a feel for how they work.\\n\\nTransferring a call\\nThe Redirect action can be used to transfer a call. After logging in, you should send an\\naction like the one below:\\n\\nThe Manager Interface | 229\\n\\x0cAction: Redirect\\nContext: Lab\\n\\nFor each action you sent over the manager interface, you can send along\\nan arbitrary ActionID value. This will allow you to recognize the responses from Asterisk as being related to your actions. It is strongly\\nrecommended that you send a unique ActionID with each of your AMI\\ncommands.\\n\\nThis URL transfers the specified channel to another extension and priority in the\\ndialplan. The response to this action is:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Redirect Successful\\n\\nReading a configuration file\\nTo read an Asterisk configuration file via the Manger interface, we can use the the\\nGetConfig action. The GetConfig action returns the contents of a configuration file, or\\nportion thereof. The following command retrieves the contents of the file users.conf.\\nAction: GetConfig\\nFilename: users.conf\\n\\nAsterisk then returns the contents of the users.conf file. The response looks like:\\nResponse: Success\\nLine-000000-000000: fullname=New User\\n\\n230 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cUpdating configuration files\\nIt is often useful to be able to update an Asterisk configuration file via the Asterisk\\nManager interface. The UpdateConfig action is used to update one or more settings in\\na configuration file. For example, to delete a user named 6003 from users.conf you could\\nissue the following command:\\nAction: UpdateConfig\\nFilename: users.conf\\nReload: yes\\nSrcFilename: users.conf\\nDstFilename: users.conf\\n\\nObviously, we\\'ve only scratched the surface of the many different actions available as\\npart of the Asterisk Manager Interface. For a more detailed listing of the available commands, see Appendix F.\\n\\nThe Flash Operator Panel\\nThe Flash Operator Panel (FOP) is one of the most popular examples of the power of\\nthe Manager interface. FOP presents a web-based visual view of your system and allows\\nyou control of calls.\\nFOP is most commonly used to enable a live attendant to view the users in the system\\nand connect calls between them. It can also be used in a call-center environment to\\nprovide CRM-triggered screen pops.\\nThe FOP management interface is shown in Figure 10-1. To grab a copy of FOP, head\\nto http://www.asternic.org.\\nFOP isn\\'t all that difficult to set up, but it does require several steps to configure. The\\nconfiguration of FOP is beyond the scope of this book, but if you head on over to the\\nFOP web site you will find the latest documentation detailing the installation and configuration process.\\nFOP has a fantastic community and a popular mailing list. The success of FOP has also\\nbeen aided by its inclusion in Trixbox.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion\\nRecently, a new bit of technology has come along which has the potential to change\\nthe way we create dialplans.\\n\\n Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is an interface that companies use to help manage customer\\n\\ninformation and interaction.\\n\\nThe Flash Operator Panel | 231\\n\\x0cFigure 10-1. The Flash Operator Panel management interface\\n\\nA New Approach to Dialplans\\nAsterisk has matured both in technological innovation and in popularity, but as one\\nbecomes more and more immersed in this wonderful world, one cannot help but bump\\ninto limitations. When you handle a lot of complex, enterprise-grade scripting with\\nAsterisk alone, you will face many obstacles using dialplan logic. As flexible and powerful as the dialplan is, as a programming language it is quite odd, and much less flexible\\nthan most modern scripting languages. When one needs to provide advanced logic, the\\ndialplan, the GUI, and even the more advanced AEL can become very frustrating.\\nAs you build more and more complexity into your dialplans, some of the following may\\ncause you some head-scratching:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConditional looping and branching\\nVariables\\nComplex data structures\\nDatabase/LDAP integration\\nUse of third-party libraries\\nExchanging and distributing VoIP functionality\\nExtending the configuration languages\\nPoor error handling\\nPoor date and time handling\\n\\n We would like to thank Jay Phillips for contributing the ideas and code for this section of the book.\\n\\n232 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0c Pattern matching\\n Usage consistency\\n Source code organization\\nMany people addressed these matters by writing the advanced logic in external programs such as Perl and PHP, and connecting to Asterisk via AMI and AGI. Unfortunately, while the desired power was now available, these interactions did not always\\nsimplify things for the developer. To the contrary, they often made development more\\ncomplex. Using existing technologies in Asterisk, but aiming to deliver power and simplicity, Adhearsion has a new approach.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion\\nAdhearsion is an open source (LGPL) framework that is designed to improve Asterisk\\nsolution development. It rests above an Asterisk system, handling parts or all of the\\ndialplan and, in a few unique ways, manages access to Asterisk with several improved\\ninterfaces. Because it runs as a separate daemon process and integrates through the\\nalready-present Gateway (AGI) and Manager (AMI) interfaces, configuring a context\\nto use Adhearsion is as simple as adding a few lines to your dialplan or adding a user\\nto manager.conf.\\nAdhearsion primarily uses the highly dynamic, object-oriented Ruby programming\\nlanguage, but has optional support for other languages such as C or Java. In the VoIP\\nworld, many things exist as conceptual objects, which means that object-oriented programming can make a lot of sense. Those familiar with Python, Perl, or other scripting\\nlanguages should have no trouble picking up Ruby, and for those who don\\'t, Ruby is\\nan excellent choice for your first scripting language.\\n\\nInstalling Adhearsion\\nRuby software is generally installed through Ruby\\'s package manager (similar to Linux\\npackage managers, but for the Ruby platform exclusively). Adhearsion exists as a gem\\nin the standard RubyGems trove so, with Ruby and RubyGems installed, Adhearsion\\nis only one install command away.\\n\\nInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on AsteriskNOW\\nAsteriskNOW comes standard with Ruby but not RubyGems (for support reasons).\\nThankfully, RubyGems can be easily installed from the Ruby rPath trove with the following command:\\nconary update rubygems=ruby.rpath.org@rpl:devel\\nsource /etc/profile\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 233\\n\\x0cInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on Linux\\nMost Linux distributions\\' package managers host a Ruby package, though some do\\nnot yet have RubyGems. With your respective distro\\'s preferred software management\\napplication, install Ruby 1.8.5 or later and RubyGems if available. If RubyGems is not\\navailable in CentOS, you can install Ruby by typing:\\nyum install ruby\\n\\nNext, we need RubyGems. You can get that by navigating to /usr/src/, and entering:\\ntar zxvf rubygems-0.9.3.tgz\\nruby setup.rb\\n\\nInstalling Ruby/RubyGems on Mac OS X\\nRuby actually ships standard with OS X, but you will need to upgrade it and install\\nRubyGems from MacPorts, an OS X package manager. With MacPorts installed, (available from http://www.macports.org if you do not already have it) you can install Ruby\\nand RubyGems with the following command:\\nsudo port install ruby rb-rubygems\\n\\nYou may also need to add /opt/local/bin to your PATH variable in /etc/profile.\\n\\nRuby/RubyGems on Windows\\nA fantastic \"one-click installer\" exists for Windows. This installer will automatically\\ninstall Ruby, RubyGems, and a few commonly used gems all in a matter of minutes.\\nYou can download the installer from http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller.\\n\\nInstalling Adhearsion from RubyGems\\nOnce you\\'ve followed one of the previous set of instructions for your system to fetch\\nRuby and RubyGems, install Adhearsion with the following command:\\ngem install adhearsion\\n\\nIf any dependencies are found, you will probably need to allow them to install for\\nAdhearsion to work correctly.\\n\\nExploring a New Adhearsion Project\\nWith Adhearsion installed, you can begin creating and initializing a new Adhearsion\\nproject with the newly created ahn command, a command-line utility that manages\\nnearly everything in Adhearsion.\\nA sample command for creating a new Adhearsion project is as follows:\\nahn create ~/newproject\\n\\n234 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cThis creates a folder at the destination specified containing the directory and file hierarchy Adhearsion needs to operate. Right away, you should be able to execute the newly\\ncreated application by running:\\nahn start ~/newproject\\n\\nTo familiarize yourself with the Adhearsion system, take a look through the application\\'s folders and read the accompanying documentation.\\n\\nAdhearsion dialplan writing\\nThe ability to write dialplans in Adhearsion is typically the first feature newcomers use.\\nSince Ruby permits such fine-grained modification of the language itself at runtime,\\none of the things Adhearsion does is make aesthetic changes, which are intended to\\nstreamline the process of developing dialplans.\\nBelow is an Adhearsion Hello World application:\\nmy_first_context {\\nplay \"hello-world\"\\n}\\n\\nThough this is completely valid Ruby syntax, not all Ruby applications look like this.\\nAdhearsion makes the declaration of context names comfortable by interpreting the\\ndialplan script specially. Your scripts will be located in the root folder of your newly\\ncreated Adhearsion application.\\nAs calls come into Asterisk and subsequently Adhearsion, Adhearsion invokes its own\\nversion of the context name from which the AGI request originated. Given this, we\\nshould ensure that a context in extensions.conf has this same name and forwards calls\\nproperly to Adhearsion.\\nThe syntax for directing calls to Adhearsion is as follows:\\n[my_first_context]\\nexten => _.,1,AGI(agi://127.0.0.1)\\n\\nThis catches any pattern dialed and goes off to Adhearsion via AGI to handle the callprocessing instructions for us. The IP provided here should of course be replaced with\\nthe necessary IP to reach your Adhearsion machine.\\nNow that you have a basic understanding of how Adhearsion and Asterisk interact,\\nhere is a more real-world dialplan example in Adhearsion:\\ninternal {\\ncase extension\\ndial SIP/extension\\n# Join a MeetMe conference with \"join\"\\njoin extension\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 235\\n\\x0celse speak \"The German office is closed\"\\nend\\nwhen US_NUMBER\\ndial SIP/\\'us-trunk-out\\'/extension\\nwhen /^\\\\d{11,}$/ # Perl-like regular expression\\n# Pass any other long numbers straight to our trunk.\\ndial IAX/\\'intl-trunk-out\\'/extension\\nelse\\nplay %w\\'sorry invalid extension please-try-again\\'\\nend\\n}\\n\\nWith just this small amount of code we accomplish quite a lot. Even with limited or\\nno knowledge of Ruby, you can probably infer the following things:\\n We use a switch-like statement on the \"extension\" variable (which Adhearsion\\ncreates for us) and branch depending on that.\\n Dialing a number between 10 and 99 routes us to the SIP peer with the dialed\\nnumerical username.\\n Any number dialed between 6000 and 6200 or between 7000 and 7030 goes to a\\nMeetMe conference of that same number. This of course requires meetme.conf to\\nhave these conference numbers configured.\\n The _\\'21XX\\' option comes straight from Asterisk\\'s pattern style. Prepending a\\nString with an underscore in Adhearsion secretly invokes a method that returns a\\nRuby regular expression. In a Ruby \"case\" statement, regular expressions can be\\nused in a \"when\" statement to check against a pattern. The end effect should be\\nvery familiar to those with extensions.conf writing experience.\\n Adhearsion\\'s syntax for representing channels also comes straight from Asterisk\\'s\\ntraditional format. SIP/123 can be used verbatim to represent the SIP peer 123. If\\na trunk were involved, SIP/trunkname/username would act as you would expect.\\n The speak() method abstracts an underlying text-to-speech engine. This can be\\nconfigured to use most of the popular engines.\\n A full-blown Perl-like regular can be used in a when statement to perform more\\nsophisticated pattern matching if Asterisk\\'s patterns do not suffice.\\n Adhearsion defines a few constants that may be useful to someone writing dialplans. The US_NUMBER constant here is a regular expression for matching an\\nAmerican number.\\n If you find the need to play several files in sequence, play() accepts an Array of\\nfilenames. By luck, Ruby has a convenient way of creating an Array of Strings.\\nThis is of course just a simple example and covers only the absolute basics of Adhearsion\\'s dialplan authoring capabilities.\\n\\n236 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cDatabase integration\\nThough immensely successful in the web development space for serving dynamic content, database integration has always been an underutilized possibility for driving\\ndynamic voice applications with Asterisk. Most Asterisk applications that do accomplish database integration outsource the complexity to a PHP or Perl AGI script because\\nthe extensions.conf or AEL grammars are simply impractical for the level of sophistication required.\\nAdhearsion uses a database integration library, called ActiveRecord, developed by the\\nmakers of the Ruby on Rails framework. With ActiveRecord, the end user seldom, if\\never, writes SQL statements. Instead, the developer accesses the database just like any\\nRuby object. Because Ruby allows such flexible dynamism, access to the database looks\\nand feels quite natural. Additionally, ActiveRecord abstracts the differences between\\ndatabase management systems, making your database access implementation agnostic.\\nWithout going too much into the internals of ActiveRecord and more sophisticated\\nuses of it, let us consider the following simple MySQL schema:\\nCREATE TABLE groups (\\n`id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,\\n`description` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`hourly_rate` decimal DEFAULT NULL\\n);\\nCREATE TABLE customers (\\n`id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,\\n`name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`phone_number` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,\\n`group_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL\\n);\\n\\nIn practice we would obviously store much more information about the customer and\\nkeep the service usage information in a database-driven call detail record, but this degree of simplicity helps demonstrate ActiveRecord fundamentals more effectively.\\nTo connect Adhearsion to this database, one simply specifies the database access information in a YAML configuration file like so:\\nadapter: mysql\\nhost: localhost\\ndatabase: adhearsion\\nusername: root\\npassword: pass\\n\\nThis tells Adhearsion how to connect to the database, but how we access information\\nin the tables depends on how we model our ActiveRecord objects. Since an object is\\nan instance of a class, we write a class definition to wrap around each table. We define\\nsimple properties and relationships in the class with the superclass\\'s methods.\\nHere are two classes we may use with the aforementioned tables:\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 237\\n\\x0cclass Customer < ActiveRecord::Base\\nbelongs_to :group\\nvalidates_presence_of\\n:name, :phone_number\\nvalidates_uniqueness_of :phone_number\\nvalidates_associated\\n:group\\ndef total_bill\\nself.group.hourly_rate * self.usage_this_month / 1.hour\\nend\\nend\\nclass Group < ActiveRecord::Base\\nhas_many :customers\\nvalidates_presence_of :description, :hourly_rate\\nend\\n\\nFrom just this small amount of information, ActiveRecord can make a lot of logical\\ninferences. When these classes interpret, ActiveRecord assumes the table names to be\\ncustomers and groups respectively by lowercasing the classes\\' names and making them\\nplural. If this convention is not desired, the author can easily override it. Additionally,\\nat interpretation time, ActiveRecord actually peeks into the database\\'s columns and\\nmakes available many new dynamically created methods.\\nThe belongs_to and has_many methods in this example define relationships between\\nCustomers and Groups. Notice again how ActiveRecord uses pluralization to make the\\ncode more expressive in the has_many :customers line. From this example, we also see\\nseveral validations--policies that ActiveRecord will enforce. When creating a new\\nCustomer we must provide a name and phone_number at the bare minimum. No two phone\\nnumbers can conflict. Every Customer must have a Group. Every Group must have a\\ndescription and hourly_rate. These help both the developer and the database stay on\\ntrack.\\nAlso, notice the total_bill method in the Customer class. On any Customer object we\\nextract from the database, we can call this method, which multiplies the hourly_rate\\nvalue of the group to which the Customer belongs by the Customer\\'s own phone usage\\nthis month (in seconds).\\nHere are a few examples that may clarify the usefulness of having Ruby objects abstract\\ndatabase logic:\\neveryone = Customer.find :all\\njay = Customer.find_by_name\\njay.phone_number # Performs\\njay.total_bill\\n# Performs\\njay.group.customers.average\\n\\n\"Jay Phillips\"\\na SELECT statement\\narithmetic on several SELECT statements\\n:usage_this_month\\n\\njay.group.destroy\\njay.group = Group.create :description => \"New cool group!\",\\n:hourly_rate => 1.23\\njay.save\\n\\n238 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cBecause the database integration here becomes much more natural, Asterisk dialplans\\nbecomes much more expressive as well. Below is a sample dialplan of a service provider\\nthat imposes a time limit on outgoing calls using information from the database. To\\nremain simple:\\n# Let\\'s assume we\\'re offering VoIP service to customers\\n# whom we can identify with their callerid.\\nservice {\\n# The line of code below performs an SQL SELECT\\n# statement on our database. The find_by_phone_number()\\n# method was created automatically because ActiveRecord\\n# found a phone_number column in the database. Adhearsion\\n# creates the \"callerid\" variable for us.\\ncaller = Customer.find_by_phone_number callerid\\nusage = caller.usage_this_month\\nif usage >= 100.hours\\nplay \"sorry-cant-let-you-do-that\"\\nelse\\nplay %w\\'to-hear-your-account-balance press-1\\notherwise wait-moment\\'\\nchoice = wait_for_digit 3.seconds\\np choice\\nif choice == 1\\ncharge = usage / 60.0 * caller.group.hourly_rate\\nplay %W\"your-account will-reflect-charge-of $#{charge}\\nthis month for #{usage / 60} minutes and\\n#{usage % 60} seconds\"\\nend\\n# We can also write back to the \"usage_this_month\"\\n# property of \"caller\". When the time method finishes,\\n# the database will be updated for this caller.\\ncaller.usage_this_month += time do\\n# Code in this block is timed.\\ndial IAX/\\'main-trunk\\'/extension\\nend\\ncaller.save\\nend\\n}\\n\\nRobust database integration like this through Adhearsion brings new ease to developing\\nfor and managing a PBX. Centrally persistent information allows Asterisk to integrate\\nwith other services cleanly while empowering more valuable services whose needs are\\nbeyond that of traditional Asterisk development technologies.\\n\\nDistributing and reusing code\\nBecause an Adhearsion application resides within a single folder, completely copying\\nthe VoIP application is as simple as zipping the files. For one of the first times in the\\nAsterisk community, users can easily exchange and build upon one another\\'s successful\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 239\\n\\x0capplication. In fact, open sourcing individual Adhearsion applications is greatly encouraged.\\nAdditionally, on a more localized level, users can reuse Adhearsion framework extensions, called helpers, or roll their own. Helpers range from entire sub-frameworks like\\nthe Micromenus framework for integrating with on-phone micro-browsers to adding\\na trivial new dialplan method that returns a random quote by Oscar Wilde.\\nBelow is a simple Adhearsion helper written in Ruby. It creates a new method that will\\nexist across the entire framework, including the dialplan. For simplicity\\'s sake, the\\nmethod downloads an XML document at a specified HTTP URL and converts it to a\\nRuby Hash object (Ruby\\'s associative array type):\\ndef remote_parse url\\nHash.from_xml open(url).read\\nend\\n\\nNote that these three lines can work as the entire contents of a helper file. When Adhearsion boots, it executes the script in a way that makes any methods or classes defined\\navailable anywhere in the system.\\nFor some issues, particularly ones of scaling Adhearsion, it may be necessary to profile\\nout bottlenecks to the king of efficiency: C. Below is a sample Adhearsion helper that\\nreturns the factorial of a number given:\\nint fast_factorial(int input) {\\nint fact = 1, count = 1;\\nwhile(count <= input) {\\nfact *= count++;\\n}\\nreturn fact;\\n}\\n\\nAgain, the code here can exist as the entire contents of a helper file. In this case, because\\nit is written in C, it should have the name factorial.alien.c. This tells Adhearsion to\\ninvoke its algorithm to read the file, add in the standard C and Ruby language development headers, compile it, cache the shared object, load it into the interpreter, and\\nthen wrap the C method in a Ruby equivalent. Below is a sample dialplan that simply\\nspeaks back the factorial of six using this C helper:\\nfast_test {\\nnum = fast_factorial 6\\nplay num\\n}\\n\\nNote that the C method becomes a first-class Ruby method. Ruby number objects\\npassed to the method are converted to C\\'s \"int\" primitive, and the return value is converted back to a Ruby number object.\\nHelpers promise robust albeit simple extensibility to a VoIP engineer\\'s toolbox, but,\\nbest of all, useful helpers can be traded and benefit the entire community.\\n\\n240 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cIntegrate with Your Desk Phone Using Micromenus\\nWith increasing competition between modern IP-enabled desk phone manufacturers,\\nthe microbrowser feature has snuck in relatively unnoticed and underutilized. The\\nprinciple is simple: physical desk phones construct interactive menus on a phone by\\npulling XML over HTTP or the like. Contending interests, however, lead this\\ntechnology amiss: every vendor\\'s XML differs, microbrowsers are often quirky, and\\navailable features vary vastly.\\nThe Micromenus framework exists as an Adhearsion helper and aims to abstract the\\ndifferences between vendors\\' phones. For this very particular development domain\\n(i.e., creating menus), Micromenus use a very simple Ruby-based \"Domain Specific\\nLanguage\" to program logic cleanly and independent of any phone brands.\\nBelow is a simple example Micromenu:\\nimage \\'company-logo\\'\\nitem \"Call an Employee\" do\\n# Creates a list of employees as callable links from a database.\\nEmployee.find(:all).each do |someone|\\n# Simply select someone to call that person on your phone.\\ncall someone.extension, someone.full_name\\nend\\nend\\nitem \"Weather Information\" do\\ncall \"Hear the weather report\" do\\nplay weather_report(\"Portland, OR\")\\nend\\nitem \"Current: \" + weather(\"Portland, OR\")[:current][:temp]\\nend\\nitem \"System Uptime: \" + `uptime`\\n\\nA list item displays in two ways. If given only a text String, Micromenus renders only\\na text element. If the arguments contain a do/end block of nested information, that text\\nbecomes a link to a sub-page rendering that nested content.\\nA call item also has two uses, each producing a link which, when selected, initiates a\\ncall. When call receives no do/end block, it simulates physically dialing the number\\ngiven as the first argument. When a do/end block exists and all calls route through\\nAdhearsion, selecting that item executes the dialplan functionality within the block.\\nThis is a great example of how handling the dialplans and on-screen microbrowsers\\nwithin the same framework pays off well.\\nFrom this example we can see a few other neat things about Micromenus:\\n Micromenus support sending images. If the requesting phone does not support\\nimages, the response will have no mention of them.\\n All Adhearsion helpers work here, too. We use the weather helper in this example.\\n The Micromenus sub-framework can use Adhearsion\\'s database integration.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 241\\n\\x0c Ruby can execute a command inside backticks and return the result as a String.\\nWe report the uptime here with it.\\nThis example of course assumes that you have configured your application\\'s database\\nintegration properly and have an Employee class mapping to a table with an exten\\nsion and full_name column.\\nBecause Micromenus simply render varying responses over HTTP, a normal web\\nbrowser can make a request to the Micromenus\\' server, too. For these more high-tech\\nendpoints, Micromenus render an attractive interface with Ajax loading, DHTML effects, and draggable windows.\\nIn the interest of \"adhering\" people together, Micromenus exist as another option to\\nmake your Adhearsion VoIP applications more robust.\\n\\nIntegrating with a Web Application\\nThough Adhearsion by design can integrate with virtually any application, including\\nPHP or Java Servlets, Ruby on Rails makes for a particularly powerful partner. Rails is\\na web development framework getting a lot of press lately for all the right reasons. Its\\ndevelopers use Ruby to its full potential, showing how meta-programming really does\\neliminate unnecessary developer work. Rails\\' remarkable code clarity and application\\nof the Don\\'t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle served as a strong inspiration to the inception of Adhearsion as it exists today.\\nStarting with Adhearsion version 0.8.0, Adhearsion\\'s application directory drops in\\nplace atop an existing Rails application, sharing data automatically. If you have needs\\nto develop a complex web interface to VoIP functionality, consider this deadly duo.\\n\\nUsing Java\\nEyebrows around the world raised when Sun announced their hiring of the two core\\ndevelopers of the JRuby interpreter project, Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo, in\\nSeptember 2006. JRuby is a Ruby interpreter written in Java instead of C. Because JRuby\\ncan compile parts of a Ruby application to Java bytecode, JRuby is actually outperforming the C implementation of Ruby 1.8 in many different benchmarks and promises\\nto outperform Ruby 1.8 in all cases in the near future.\\nA Ruby application running in JRuby has the full benefit of not only Ruby libraries but\\nany Java library as well. Running Adhearsion in JRuby brings the dumbfounding assortment of third-party Java libraries to PBX dialplan writing. If your corporate\\nenvironment requires tight integration with other Java technologies, embedding Adhearsion in a J2EE stack may offer the flexibility needed.\\n\\n242 | Chapter 10: Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and Adhearsion\\n\\x0cMore Information\\nFor more information about the fast-moving Adhearsion community, including complete walkthroughs, see Adhearsion\\'s official web site at http://adhearsion.com, Adhearsion\\'s official blog at http://blog.adhearsion.com, the web site of Adhearsion\\'s\\nparent consulting company http://codemecca.com, or for help learning Ruby, see http://\\njicksta.com.\\n\\nAsterisk Development with Adhearsion | 243\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nThe Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\n...I was constructing a lighthouse while all the others\\nwere making ships.\\n--Charles Simic\\n\\nThis chapter introduces the components that comprise the GUI and help it work with\\nAsterisk. It describes the installation of the web server and the GUI components for\\nthose who are not using the AsteriskNOW distribution. It also shows you how to\\nmodify the GUI to suit your purposes. Technical information is also provided so that\\ndevelopers wishing to create their own GUI or application can utilize the web server\\nand GUI components. We\\'d like to thank the folks at Digium for writing this chapter,\\nespecially the code examples, which they developed and tested.\\n\\nWhy a GUI for Asterisk?\\nSince the beginning, Asterisk has been a phone system for the brave. In the early days\\nit took guts and more than a bit of tenacity to make Asterisk do your bidding. Those\\nwilling to accept the learning curve, wade into the config files, and fight for their calls\\nwere rewarded with a powerful, flexible phone system (as well as a very marketable\\nskill set). However, the mass market was not, and is not, ready to script extensions,\\nmanage peers, and handle the other tasks that are the crux of Asterisk administration.\\nSince the early pre-1.0 days, people have tried to tame the mighty Asterisk with config\\nfile generators tied to databases and managed via a range of graphical user interfaces\\n(GUIs). The most successful of these did a fine job of creating an Asterisk-based application, but none of them provided the full flexibility that the raw scripting environment offers. By replacing the digital haiku of the dialplan with a limited list of options,\\nthe resulting system is reduced from Asterisk to an Asterisk-based system. Not a bad\\nthing, but not the whole enchilada.*\\n* In fact, two of the authors of this book once attempted to write the ultimate Asterisk GUI. Lucky for you,\\n\\nthey abandoned the project and began writing Asterisk documentation instead!\\n\\n\\x0cIn order for a GUI to be the Asterisk GUI, it would have to leave intact the manually\\nscripted configuration files that have been the lingua franca of Asterisk since the dawn\\nof time. It would have to provide a simple, graphical means of configuration without\\ncompromising the underlying Asterisk software or irrevocably fixing decisions that\\nshould be left open to the end user. It would also have to provide advanced functionality\\nwithout taxing the computer or stealing valuable resources from the core goal of processing calls.\\nCoinciding with the release of Asterisk 1.4, Digium launched the Asterisk GUI project.\\nThe GUI was originally conceived as a component of Digium\\'s Asterisk embedded\\nappliance. The appliance, sold as the Asterisk Appliance Developers Kit (AADK) as\\nwell as in a standalone configuration, is a small, solid-state Linux computer with optional analog (and potentially digital) interfaces. The GUI was built using a flexible and\\nexpandable framework that placed as much of the display and validation logic as possible on the client computer. It also took into consideration the need to preserve\\nhandwritten config files while providing an automated means of editing them. The\\nresulting framework is known as AJAM (a play on the popular \"Web 2.0\" technology\\nknown as Ajax), which means Asynchronous JavaScript and Asterisk Manager. The\\ncore AJAM code, a series of AJAM-enabled web pages, and an extension to the Asterisk\\nmanager work together to form the Asterisk GUI framework.\\n\\nWhat Is the GUI?\\nThe Asterisk GUI is the interface that comes with the AsteriskNOW distribution or\\ncan be added to an existing Asterisk installation. The default interface is geared toward\\nthe user who wants to use Asterisk as a PBX for a small business with fairly typical\\ntelecom needs. It can best be thought of as a sample of what can be done using AJAM;\\nthink of it as a beta interface that can be expected to evolve according to the desires of\\nthe community. This has caused a lot of excitement in the Asterisk community, because\\nthe underlying technologies behind the GUI raise the bar on what a PBX interface can\\nbecome. It also enables you to build your own interfaces that are tuned to your unique\\nrequirements.\\n\\nMark Spencer Talks About the GUI\\nAsterisk is a powerful telephony platform. However, that power is only as valuable as its\\nability to be used by a particular target user. There is a lot of value to having graphical\\ninterfaces (GUIs) for Asterisk. Most GUIs are specifically designed to support a particular\\ntask. For example, some GUIs are designed specifically for voicemail systems. Others are\\nspecifically targeted to the hospitality industry. There is some demand to have a GUI that\\ntargets Asterisk generally, but there is a natural trade-off between the ease of use and\\nsimplicity of a GUI, versus the number of available features. For example, the GUI that\\na seasoned systems administrator might require would likely be different than that of an\\noffice administrator who is only responsible for simple moves, adds, and changes to the\\nsystem. Given this wide ranging demand, Digium developed a GUI framework called\\n\\n246 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c(uncreatively) the Asterisk GUI. Rather than developing a single GUI, Digium developed\\ndifferent GUIs and a framework to trivialize the creation and modification of GUIs for\\ndifferent segments.\\nA second goal was to make sure that the GUI interacted with Asterisk\\'s traditional configuration methods in a way that did not preclude someone from using them. Most GUIs\\nfor Asterisk use an intermediate configuration format or database, then spit out configs\\nfor Asterisk to use. Unfortunately that means that any option that is not presented within\\nthe GUI cannot be \"manually\" set in the configuration files. By contrast, the Asterisk\\nGUI actually modifies your traditional Asterisk configuration files, meaning that your\\nchanges in the GUI and your changes to the files themselves can co-exist and even flow\\nback and forth. As an example, if you change the caller ID for a user in users.conf then\\nrefresh the GUI, you\\'ll see the change in the GUI as well. Likewise if you change it in the\\nGUI and reload the file, you\\'ll see the change in the file. If you add new settings that are\\nnot presented in the GUI (for example if you add nat=yes to a particular entry in\\nusers.conf, then change the caller ID in the GUI, you\\'ll see that the nat=yes line will remain\\nin the file even though the caller ID change goes through. Comments are also generally\\npreserved across GUI edits. This means that not only is the GUI no longer required to\\ndisplay all possible configurations, since esoteric ones can be set manually. This also\\nmeans that when someone starts by using the Asterisk GUI and then outgrows it, there\\nis a natural path for them to be able to start creating more sophisticated functions without\\nabandoning the GUI with which they\\'re familiar.\\n\\nUsing the GUI\\nWhen you first log in to a newly created GUI, the system walks you through a wizard\\nthat lets you set up the basic elements of your phone system.\\nThe GUI may not be able to detect all types of TDM interfaces, and thus\\nmay report that it cannot find any cards even though you have some\\ninstalled. It is expected that the GUI will eventually be able to detect\\nand manage any cards that use the Zaptel interface, but this functionality is going to be complex, and is still in development at this time.\\n\\nThe wizard walks you through some basic settings such as extension length and dialing\\nrules. We are not going to get into detail on how the default GUI works. It is in constant\\ndevelopment, and what we write about here is not likely to be what you will experience\\nwhen you read this.\\n\\nGUI elements\\nThe standard GUI that comes with AsteriskNOW (or can be downloaded via SVN) has\\na standard set of elements that represent the sorts of things a typical small office PBX\\nmight want. The menu items are currently:\\n Users\\n Conferencing\\n Voicemail\\nWhat Is the GUI? | 247\\n\\x0c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCall Queues\\nService Providers\\nCalling Rules\\nIncoming Calls\\nVoice Menus\\nRecord a Menu\\nActive Channels\\nGraphs\\nSystem Info\\nBackup\\nOptions\\n\\nArchitecture of the Asterisk GUI\\nBefore we get too far into exploring the Asterisk GUI (or developing your own), it\\'s\\nimportant to understand the flow of information between the client (the web browser)\\nand Asterisk. Since these interfaces are Ajax applications, there are a lot of pieces that\\naren\\'t immediately obvious. The flow of control goes something like this:\\n The browser \"surfs to\" the URL for your management application.\\n Asterisk\\'s web server sends the browser an HTML page, libraries, and the application itself (which is written in JavaScript and makes heavy use of Ajax).\\n The user interacts with the browser; as needed, the JavaScript application sends\\ncommands back to the web server. These commands are in the form of URLs that\\nrequest some action from the Asterisk server itself.\\n The web server interprets the URLs. If the user has logged in successfully, it sends\\na command (an action) to Asterisk via the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), described in Chapter 10.\\n Asterisk executes the action and the results (a status code and possibly data) to the\\nweb server.\\n The web server sends Asterisk\\'s response back to the JavaScript application on the\\nbrowser.\\n The JavaScript application updates the browser\\'s display.\\nWhile it may sound a little complicated at first glance, don\\'t be intimidated. It\\'s a very\\nflexible and powerful architecture that can be used for a myriad of applications, not\\njust an Asterisk GUI. For now, however, we\\'ll concentrate on enhancing the Asterisk\\nGUI. Let\\'s begin by configuring the underlying pieces, and then move on to installing\\nand modifying the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\n248 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cComponents of the Asterisk GUI\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at some of the key components of the Asterisk GUI. We\\'ll use\\nthese components later in the chapter to modify the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\nAsterisk Manager Interface\\nAs explained in Chapter 10, the Asterisk Manager Interface allows external programs\\nto control Asterisk. The Manager interface is the heart of the Asterisk GUI, as it does\\nall of the heavy lifting.\\n\\nManager over HTTP and the Asterisk web server\\nThe web server built into Asterisk allows manager commands to be sent to Asterisk via\\nHTTP, instead of creating a socket connection directly to the Manager interface. This\\nmakes it much simpler for a web application to issue AMI commands to Asterisk using\\nthe Asynchronous JavaScript Asterisk Manager (AJAM), which we will cover shortly.\\nThe web server can also be configured to serve static content, such as HTML files and\\nimages.\\n\\nAJAM and JavaScript\\nThe AJAM framework uses JavaScript and XML to asynchronously send commands to\\nAsterisk, and to update the information displayed in the web browser.\\n\\nInstalling the Asterisk GUI\\nIf you didn\\'t install AsteriskNOW, you need to download and install the Asterisk GUI\\nfiles. Once the files are downloaded, you simply compile and install them as part of\\nyour Asterisk installation.\\nYou need Asterisk 1.4 or later in order use the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\n You may be asking yourself, \"Why embed a web server inside of Asterisk? Why not just use an external web\\n\\nserver?\" While you can use an external web server to serve up the Asterisk GUI, it\\'s beyond the scope of this\\nchapter, as the security model behind Ajax permits Ajax requests only to the same domain, port, and protocol\\nthat sent the HTML page. This is often referred to as the same-origin policy.\\n\\nInstalling the Asterisk GUI | 249\\n\\x0cYou can get the latest version of the GUI files by checking them out of Digium\\'s Subversion repository. If you have Subversion installed on your computer, you can\\ndownloaded the GUI code by using the following command:\\n# cd /usr/src\\n# or wherever you prefer to download source code to\\n# svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk-gui/trunk asterisk-gui\\n\\nInstalling the GUI is simple as this:\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd asterisk-gui\\n./configure\\nmake\\nmake install\\nmake samples\\n\\nAfter running the previous commands, the GUI files are installed and part of your\\nAsterisk distribution.\\n\\nSetting up httpd.conf and manager.conf\\nConfiguring the Asterisk web server to process AJAM requests involves several simple\\nsteps. In the /etc/asterisk/http.conf file, add (or un-comment) the following:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\nenablestatic=yes\\nprefix=asterisk\\n\\n; without this, you can only send AMI commands, not display\\n; html content\\n; address you want the Asterisk HTTP server to respond on\\n; port you want the Asterisk HTTP server to respond on\\n; will form part of the URI, similar to a directory name\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve got httpd.conf set up, we can serve up content to a browser. To allow\\nthe web client to send commands to Asterisk, we have to make some changes to the\\nAsterisk Manger Interface (AMI). We do this by adding a few lines to the [general]\\nsection of manager.conf, and by adding a user account with the config permission set.\\nOpen up manager.conf and edit it to match the following:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\nwebenabled=yes\\n\\n; you may already have AMI enabled if you are using it for other things\\n; this enables the interaction between the Asterisk web server and AMI\\n\\n[asterisk_http] ; you can name the user whatever you want\\nsecret = gooey\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\n\\nSave the changes and restart Asterisk. You should be able to connect to Asterisk\\'s web\\nserver through the following URI:\\n There is currently no way to download the GUI via FTP. That situation may change at any time, so feel free\\n\\nto check the Asterisk web site for updated information.\\n\\n250 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c\\nIf for some reason you\\'re having problems getting to that demo page, go back to the\\nasterisk-gui source code directory and run:\\n# make checkconfig\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it! Asterisk is now web-enabled. Now, let\\'s move on to the actual work of\\ndeveloping with the Asterisk GUI.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI\\nOnce you\\'ve installed the files for the Asterisk GUI, you can begin to play with developing for the GUI. Over the next few sections, we\\'ll walk through setting up the various\\ncomponents and putting them together to enhance and expand the capabilities of the\\nGUI.\\n\\nIssuing Manager Commands over HTTP\\nThe Asterisk GUI issues commands to Asterisk by calling specially crafted URLs to the\\nAsterisk web server. This section provides examples of some commonly used commands (actions) and the corresponding web server responses. These AMI URLs have\\nthe following general structure:\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/rawman?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/manager?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\nhttp://hostname:8088/asterisk/mxml?action=command&....parameter=value pairs...\\n\\nThe difference between the rawman, manager and mxml URLs is important. The web server\\nexports three different views of the AMI interface. If you use a rawman URL, the server\\nreturns a series of keyword/value pairs in the HTTP response. If you use a manager URL,\\nthe server returns the result formatted as HTML. In a similar style, if you use a mxml\\nURL, the server returns the results formatted in XML. For modern Ajax-style applications, the rawman and mxml forms are probably more useful.\\nThe actions that can be sent to the server, along with their parameters, are the ordinary\\nmanager commands described in Appendix F. Note that the LOGIN and CHALLENGE actions are unique in that they aren\\'t sent to Asterisk itself, but are processed by the\\nManager interface to authenticate the user. If the user hasn\\'t authenticated correctly,\\nthe server returns an error response rather than sending the action to Asterisk for processing.\\nLet\\'s look at some commonly used actions, and see how we can use them to control\\nthe server.\\n\\n By similar reasoning, the manager form is much easier for humans to use for debugging purposes.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 251\\n\\x0cLOGIN\\nThe LOGIN command authenticates credentials for the Manager interface\\'s HTML view.\\nOnce you are logged in, Asterisk stores a cookie on your browser (valid for the length\\nof the httptimeout setting). This cookie is used to connect to the same session. The URL:\\n&secret=gooey\\nsends a login command to the web server that includes the credentials. If successful,\\nthe web server responds with:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Authentication accepted\\n\\nThis, of course, is a very simplistic way for a login to work. Sending the username and\\nsecret password in a URL is bad practice, though it\\'s very useful during development.\\nA more appropriate way to handle the login, and an example of more complex command processing, is to use a challenge/response sequence. Issue a request like this:\\nThe CHALLENGE command initiates a challenge/response sequence that can be used to\\nlog in a user. The server responds by sending a challenge (an arbitrary string) in the\\nresponse:\\nResponse: Success\\n\\nYour application answers the challenge by computing the MD5 hash of the challenge\\nconcatenated with the user\\'s password. Here\\'s how a user might manually calculate\\nthe MD5 hash:\\n# echo -n 113543555gooey | md5sum\\n\\n-\\n\\nYou can then use the calculated hash as the login key in a URL like this:\\nFor security reasons, the login action must take place within five seconds\\nof the challenge action. Note also that cookies must be enabled for the\\nchallenge/response to work, as the cookie ensures that the login action\\nuses the same manager session ID as the challenge action.\\n\\nIf you use a manager URL to request the challenge (instead of using rawman), the response\\nwill be formatted as HTML:\\n<title>Asterisk&trade; Manager Interface</title>\\n<body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\\n\\n252 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0c<tr><td>Response</td><td>Success</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</body>\\n\\nSimilarly, if you use the mxml view instead, you will receive a response formatted as XML:\\n<Ajax-response>\\n<response type=\\'object\\' id=\\'unknown\\'>\\n<generic response=\\'Success\\' challenge=\\'113543555\\' />\\n</response>\\n</Ajax-response>\\n\\nOther than the formatting, there are no other differences between the three types of\\nresponses. For most applications, digging the challenge out of the keyword/value pairs\\nwill be much simpler than using rawman or mxml in a situation like this, where you don\\'t\\nneed to display the HTML to the user.\\n\\nTransferring a call\\nThe REDIRECT action can be used to transfer a call. Simply generate a URL such as:\\nThis URL transfers the specified channel to another extension and priority in the\\ndialplan. The response to this action is:\\nResponse: Success\\nMessage: Redirect Successful\\n\\nReading a configuration file\\nThe GETCONFIG command returns the contents of a configuration file, or portion thereof.\\nThe URL:\\nreturns the contents of the users.conf file. The Asterisk GUI uses this functionality to\\npresent the current Asterisk configuration to the end user. The response looks like this:\\nResponse: Success\\nLine-000000-000000: fullname=New User\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 253\\n\\x0cLine-000001-000000: fullname=Bill Savage\\n\\nUpdating configuration files using UPDATECONFIG\\nThe UPDATECONFIG action is used to update one or more settings in a configuration file.\\nFor example, to delete a user you should use a URL like this:\\n\\nError response\\nA user must be logged in to the web server before any other commands can be issued.\\nAny of the commands we\\'ve discussed will return an error response if the user is not\\nauthenticated. If it\\'s not given by an authenticated user, this URI http://localhost:8088/\\nasterisk/rawman?action=ping returns this response to indicate an error:\\nResponse: Error\\nMessage: Authentication Required\\n\\nAjax, AJAM, and Asterisk\\nAs an acronym, Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. While the term\\nincludes the words asynchronous and XML, this does not mean that you can make only\\nasynchronous requests, nor are you required to use XML. Some authors describe Ajax\\nas simply a combination of HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, and DOM. The next generation browsers, such as Mozilla/Firefox, use an XMLHttpRequest (a JavaScript object)\\nto send an asynchronous request to the server. The request is made in the background\\nand processed by the server.\\n\\n254 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cBack on the browser, the result is handled by a callback: whatever the server returns\\ncan be stored and used to update the page being displayed. For Internet Explorer 5 or\\nlater, the XMLHttp ActiveX object serves the same purpose.\\n\\nForm processing in a traditional web application\\nHTML forms are usually submitted by using a submit button (type=submit). When the\\nuser clicks the submit button, processing stops, and doesn\\'t continue until the server\\nreturns a new page:\\n<FORM action=\"login.php\" method=\"POST\">\\n<input type=text name=\"username\">\\n<input type=password name=\"password\">\\n<input type=submit>\\n</FORM>\\n\\nBefore going any further with Ajax or JavaScript, let\\'s take a look at how a traditional\\nweb application works. Traditional web applications use HTML\\'s <FORM> element to\\ndefine a form in which all of the parameters a user needs to send to the server are defined.\\nIn addition the action=\"login.php\" informs the browser where to send all of these\\nvariables. The method=\"POST\" tells the browser how to send these variables to the server.\\n\\nForm processing in an Ajax application\\nAn Ajax application uses JavaScript to send the contents of a form to the server. If you\\nhave made the request asynchronously, your JavaScript code doesn\\'t wait for the server\\nto respond. This also means that you can let the users continue to interact with the\\npage, even though a request may be taking place in the background. This can be dangerous and, thus, you may want to restrict certain actions until a request has completed.\\nThe browser, by default, gives no visual indication that a request is being made in the\\nbackground. It is your responsibility to inform the user of the progress of a request.\\nHere\\'s the code for submitting the contents of the username and password fields via\\nAjax:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction submitform(){\\nvar uname = document.getElementById(\"username\").value;\\nvar pwd = document.getElementById(\"password\").value;\\n// xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\"); // IE 7\\n// xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\"); // IE 5\\nxmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Mozilla or Firefox\\nvar url = \"/rawman?action=login&username=\" + escape(uname) + \"&secret=\" + escape(pwd);\\nxmlHttp.open(\"GET\", url, true);\\nxmlHttp.onreadystatechange = dosomething;\\n// dosomething() would be another JavaScript function\\nxmlHttp.send(null);\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 255\\n\\x0cThe getElementById() method reads the value of the username and the password fields.\\nThis code then gets an XMLHttpRequest object, which it uses to send these values back\\nto the server. Note that the kind of object you need depends on whether your users are\\nusing Internet Explorer 7, 5, or Mozilla/Firefox. It\\'s fairly easy to write code to handle\\nall of these situations, or to use a library like Prototype to handle platform independence\\nfor you. The username and password are encoded in a URL and sent to the server. The\\ncall to xmlHttp.onreadystatechange registers a handler to process the result that the\\nserver returns to us.\\nThis code only deals with making the XMLHttp request, and it tells the browser to call\\nthe dosomething() function when there is a response from the server. Here\\'s a\\ndosomething() function that handles this response:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction dosomething() {\\nif (xmlHttp.readyState == 4) {\\nvar login_response = xmlHttp.responseText;\\n}\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nMake sure that each XMLHttp step has completed (with either success\\nor failure) before performing the next one.\\n\\nThis function is called whenever there\\'s a change in the state of the HTTP request. The\\nif statement saves the response only if the request\\'s readyState is 4, which means that\\nthe request has completed. The JavaScript variable login_response now contains the\\nresponse of the login page.\\nNote that this is very far from being production-ready code. In particular, the simplistic\\nusername and password handling is appropriate for testing, but would be a serious\\nsecurity problem in a production system--even if the application is used only on a\\nprivate network. To build more robust and secure password handling, use the challenge/response system presented earlier. If you want to learn more about writing Ajax\\nweb applications, we recommend Head Rush Ajax by Brett McLaughlin (O\\'Reilly).\\n\\nThe Prototype framework\\nPrototype (http://prototypejs.org) is a JavaScript framework released under an MIT-style\\nlicense. Prototype can make your job extremely easy while developing an Ajax application. It provides many ways to make your code shorter and clearer. For example, in\\nthe submitform function, the call to document.getElementById() can be replaced by the\\n$() function. Likewise, the call to value to get the DOM element\\'s content can be\\nreplaced with a call to $F(). Thus, document.getElementById(\"username\").value becomes simply $F(\\'username\\'); the result is code that\\'s much simpler and more readable.\\n\\n256 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cPrototype also makes it easy to make XMLHttp requests in an elegant manner. Using\\nPrototype\\'s Ajax object, the submitform() function can be rewritten as:\\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\\nfunction submitform(){\\nvar url = \\'/rawman\\';\\nvar pars = \\'username=\\' + escape($F(\\'username\\')) + \\'&secret=\\' + escape($F(\\'password\\'));\\nvar myAjax = new Ajax.Request( url,\\n{ method: \\'get\\',\\nparameters: pars,\\nonComplete: dosomething\\n});\\n}\\n</script>\\n\\nNot only is this code much shorter, you don\\'t have to write browser-specific code in\\nyour web pages; Prototype takes care of the differences between Mozilla/Firefox and\\nthe various versions of Internet Explorer. Furthermore, it takes care of testing the request\\'s readyState, so you leave that annoying if statement out of your handler.\\nPrototype has lots of built-in functions, some of which have been extensively used in\\nthe Asterisk framework. There\\'s no room to discuss them here, but for more information, see the Short Cuts Prototype Quick Reference by Scott Raymond and\\nPrototype and Scriptaculous: Taking the Pain Out of JavaScript by Chris Angus, both\\nfrom O\\'Reilly.\\n\\nCustomization of the GUI\\nNow that we\\'ve explored the different pieces that form the foundation of the Asterisk\\nGUI, we have what we need to be able to explore the GUI itself and modify it to fit our\\nneeds. To get to the Asterisk GUI, go to the following address in your browser: http://\\nlocalhost:8088/asterisk/static/config/cfgbasic.html.\\nLooking at Figure 11-1 might lead you to conclude that the Asterisk GUI is simply one\\nmore Asterisk GUI in an already crowded space. Nothing could be further from the\\ntruth. This GUI doesn\\'t just allow you to tweak it, it practically begs you to. In this\\nsection we are going to discuss how you can modify the GUI and use AJAM to build\\nyour own extensions to the GUI. In order to benefit the most from this information,\\nyou need some HTML and JavaScript knowledge.\\nThe GUI home page is named cfgbasic.html. All other pages are loaded into the iframe\\ncontained within the cfgbasic.html page. By default, cfgbasic.html loads home.html into\\nthe main frame.\\nFor most changes to the GUI, you\\'ll eventually need to modify cfgbasic.html, which is\\nthe login screen.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 257\\n\\x0cFigure 11-1. A screenshot of the Asterisk GUI\\n\\nAdding a new tab to the GUI\\nAs an example of customizing the Asterisk GUI, let\\'s create a new tab that displays the\\ncontents of extensions.conf. First, we need to create a file and put it in the /var/lib/\\nasterisk/static-html/config directory. In this example, we\\'ll name the file test.html:\\n<script src=\"scripts/prototype.js\"></script>\\n<script src=\"scripts/astman.js\"></script>\\n<script>\\nfunction localAjaxinit() {\\nparent.loadscreen(this);\\nmakerequest(\\'g\\',\\'extensions.conf\\', \\'\\' , function(t){\\n$(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t + \"</PRE>\";\\n});\\n}\\n</script>\\n<body onload=\"localAjaxinit()\" bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\">\\n<div id=\"ExtensionsDotConf\"></div>\\n</body>\\n\\nThis code simply displays the configuration of the extensions.conf file. Obviously it\\'s a\\nvery simple example, but it shows the fundamentals of creating a new page for the\\nAsterisk GUI. Let\\'s walk through the example step by step.\\nThe first line tells the browser to load the Prototype library. The second line tells the\\nbrowser to load the astman.js file, which contains much of the code designed to interact\\nwith the Manager interface.\\n\\n258 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cNext, we define a function called localAjaxinit. The localAjaxinit function first tells\\nthis page\\'s parent (cfgbasic.html in this case) to run the loadscreen function, passing in\\nthis page as the parameter. This causes the main GUI screen to load our new\\ntest.html inside the iframe. The second thing we do inside the localAjaxinit function\\nis to use the makerequest function. The makerequest function is defined in astman.js and\\nmakes it very convenient to make requests to the web server.\\nThe first parameter of the makerequest function specifies what type of request is being\\nmade. It can be set to any of the following:\\n\\'g\\'\\n\\nUse the GetConfig action to retrieve the configuration from the configuration file\\nspecified in the second parameter.\\n\\'u\\'\\n\\nUse the UpdateConfig action to update the configuration in the configuration file\\nspecified in the second parameter. The third parameter to the function specifies\\nthe configuration data that should be updated.\\n\\'\\'\\n\\nIf the first parameter to the makerequest function is a set of single quotes, then the\\ncustom action specified in the third parameter will be sent.\\nThe fourth parameter is the callback function that will be called with the response to\\nthe Ajax request.\\n\\nExamples of Using makerequest\\nAs an example, the following code snippet shows three different ways to use the\\nmakerequest function. In the first, we\\'ll get the configuration data from users.conf. In\\nthe second, we\\'ll update musiconhold.conf and change the value of the random setting\\nin the default class. Last but not least, we\\'ll call the Ping action. Each of them sets a\\ncallback function named t that simply replaces the contents of the div with the response\\nof the Ajax call.\\nmakerequest( \\'g\\', \\'users.conf\\', \\'\\' ,\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\nmakerequest( \\'u\\', \\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\nmakerequest( \\'\\', \\'\\', \\'action=Ping\\' ,\\nfunction(t) { $(\\'ExtensionsDotConf\\').innerHTML = \"<PRE>\" + t +\\n\"</PRE>\"; } );\\n\\n In reality, makerequest is a simple wrapper around a call to Prototype\\'s Ajax.Request method.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 259\\n\\x0cThe rest of our test.html simply contains an HTML body with a div element, which is\\nwhere we\\'ll place the configuration data when we get it. Note that the HTML body tag\\nhas an onload attribute, which causes the browser to execute the localAjaxinit function\\nonce the page has finished loading.\\nNow that we\\'ve created a new page, we need to edit cfgbasic.html to add this page as\\na panel in the GUI. Open cfgbasic.html and search for a JavaScript function named\\nreturnpanels and insert this code in the list of panels, where you would like your panel\\nto appear:\\nnewpanel( [\"Test\", \"test.html\", \"Test\"]);\\n\\nNow reload the GUI in your browser. You should see a new tab on the lefthand side\\nnamed Test that displays the configuration values for extensions.conf when clicked.\\nWhile there\\'s a lot more to learn about the AJAM interface and the Asterisk GUI, this\\nexample should show just how easy it is to add new functionality to the GUI. In this\\nnext example, we\\'ll show how simple it is to expose a setting from the configuration\\nfiles in the GUI.\\n\\nExposing configuration settings in the GUI\\nAs explained earlier, one of the unique benefits of the Asterisk GUI over the other\\ngraphical frontends to Asterisk is that it updates the configuration files in place, taking\\nspecial care not to overwrite or erase any extra settings you might have in your configuration files. To show just how easy it is to expose new settings in the GUI, we\\'ll add\\na simple checkbox to the GUI to make it possible to set the nat setting in users.conf.\\nIf you open the GUI and click on the tab labeled Users, the GUI loads the file named\\nusers.html in the iframe. Let\\'s open up users.html (usually located in /var/lib/asterisk/\\nstatic-http/config) and begin modifying it to add our checkbox.\\nFirst, search near the top of the file where a variable named fieldnames is defined. This\\nvariable contains a list of all of the field names that will be set by this page of the GUI.\\nSimply add nat to the end of the list, or add the following line directly below the current\\ndefinition for fieldnames.\\nfieldnames.push(\\'nat\\');\\n\\nThis tells the Asterisk GUI that we want to be able to see the value of nat and to be able\\nto set it as well. In order to see or set the value, however, we need to add an element to\\nthe HTML form. To do that, search users.html for the IAX checkbox, and add the\\nfollowing lines between it and the CTI checkbox.\\n<tr>\\n<td align=right><input type=\\'checkbox\\' id=\\'nat\\'></td>\\n<td>NAT</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\nSimply reload the page, and that\\'s all there is to it. With just a few lines of additional\\ncode, we\\'re able to expose the nat setting to the GUI. It couldn\\'t be much simpler!\\n260 | Chapter 11: The Asterisk GUI Framework\\n\\x0cAs you\\'re developing for the Asterisk GUI, you\\'ll probably find that\\ndebugging Ajax and JavaScript code can be somewhat difficult at times.\\nWe strongly suggest you make use of an extension to Mozilla Firefox\\nnamed Firebug that greatly simplifies the task of debugging Ajax, JavaScript, and HTML. Check it out at http://www.getfirebug.com. There is\\nalso a scaled-down version for Internet Explorer known as Firebug Lite,\\nwhich is available for download at the same web site.\\n\\nFor More Information\\nOver the course of this chapter, we\\'ve introduced you to the Asterisk GUI and the\\nAJAM framework. We\\'ve covered the architecture of how the GUI works, and how to\\nmodify the GUI. If you would like more information on developing a graphical interface\\nfor Asterisk, please refer to the GUI Developers Guide located at http://asterisknow.org/\\ndevelopers/gui-guide.\\n\\nDeveloping for the Asterisk GUI | 261\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\nRelational Database Integration\\n\\nFew things are harder to put up with than the annoyance\\nof a good example.\\n--Mark Twain\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn this chapter we are going to explore integrating some Asterisk features and functions\\ninto a database. There are several databases available for Linux, but we have chosen to\\nlimit our discussion to PostgreSQL. While we acknowledge MySQL is also an extremely\\npopular database, we had to choose one, and our experience with PostgreSQL tipped\\nthe scale in its favor. All that having been said, what we are actually going to be doing\\nis discussing the ODBC connector, so as long has you have familiarity with getting your\\nfavorite database ODBC-ready, the substance of this chapter will apply to you.\\nIntegrating Asterisk with databases is one of the fundamental elements allowing clustering of Asterisk into a large, distributed system. By utilizing the power of the database,\\ndynamically changing data can convey information across an array of Asterisk systems.\\nOur newest favorite Asterisk function is func_odbc, which we will cover later in this\\nchapter.\\nWhile not all Asterisk deployments will require a relational database, understanding\\nhow to harness them opens the lid of a treasure chest full of new ways to design your\\ntelecom solution.\\n\\nInstalling the Database\\nThe first thing to do is to install the PostgreSQL database server:*\\n# yum install -y postgresql-server\\n* On a large, busy system you will want to install this on a completely separate box from your Asterisk system.\\n\\n\\x0cThen start the database, which will take a few seconds to initialize for the first time:\\n# service postgresql start\\n\\nNext, create a user called asterisk, which we will use to connect to and manage the\\ndatabase. Run the following commands:\\n# su - postgres\\n$ createuser -P\\nEnter name of user\\nEnter password for\\nEnter it again:\\nShall the new role\\nShall the new user\\nShall the new user\\nCREATE USER\\n\\nto add: asterisk\\nnew user:\\nbe a superuser? (y/n) n\\nbe allowed to create databases? (y/n) y\\nbe allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n\\n\\nBy default, PostgreSQL does not listen on the TCP/IP connection, which Asterisk will\\nbe using. We need to modify the /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf file in order to allow\\nAsterisk to make IP connections to the database. To do this, simply remove the comment from the beginning of the tcpip_socket and port parameters.

This\\nsaves a lot of development effort and code maintenance. There is a slight performance\\ncost to this because we are adding another application layer between Asterisk and the\\ndatabase. However, this can be mitigated with proper design and is well worth it when\\nyou need powerful, flexible database capabilities in your Asterisk system.\\nBefore we install the connector in Asterisk, we have to install ODBC into Linux itself.\\nTo install the ODBC drivers, simply run the command:\\n# yum install -y unixODBC unixODBC-devel libtool-ltdl libtool-ltdl-devel\\n\\nSee Chapter 3 for the matrix of packages you should have installed.\\n\\nWe need to install the unixODBC-devel package because it is used by Asterisk to create\\nthe ODBC modules we will be using throughout this chapter.\\nVerify that you have the PostgreSQL ODBC driver configured in the /etc/odbcinst.ini\\nfile. It should look something like this:\\n[PostgreSQL]\\nDescription\\nDriver\\nSetup\\nFileUsage\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\nODBC for PostgreSQL\\n/usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so\\n/usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so\\n\\nVerify the system is able to see the driver by running the following command. It should\\nreturn the label name PostgreSQL if all is well.\\n# odbcinst -q -d\\n[PostgreSQL]\\n\\nInstalling and Configuring ODBC | 265\\n\\x0cNext, configure the /etc/odbc.ini file, which is used to create an identifier that Asterisk\\nwill use to reference this configuration. If at any point in the future you need to change\\nthe database to something else, you simply need to reconfigure this file, allowing Asterisk to continue to point to the same place.\\n[asterisk-connector]\\nDescription\\n=\\nDriver\\n=\\nDatabase\\n=\\nServername\\n=\\nUserName\\n=\\nPassword\\n=\\nPort\\n=\\nProtocol\\n=\\nReadOnly\\n=\\nRowVersioning\\n=\\nShowSystemTables\\n=\\nShowOidColumn\\n=\\nFakeOidIndex\\n=\\nConnSettings\\n=\\n\\nPostgreSQL connection to \\'asterisk\\' database\\nPostgreSQL\\nasterisk\\nlocalhost\\nasterisk\\nwelcome\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\nNo\\n\\nLet\\'s verify that we can connect to our database using the isql application. The isql\\napplication will not perform the connect as the root user, and must be run as the same\\nowner as the database. Since the owner of the asterisk database under PostgreSQL is\\nthe asterisk user, we must create a Linux account with the same name. In Chapter 14,\\nwe will take advantage of this user to run Asterisk as non-root.\\n# su - asterisk\\n$ echo \"select 1\" | isql -v asterisk-connector\\n+---------------------------------------+\\n| Connected!\\n|\\n|\\n|\\n| sql-statement\\n|\\n| help [tablename]\\n|\\n| quit\\n|\\n|\\n|\\n+---------------------------------------+\\nSQL> +------------+\\n| ?column?\\n|\\n+------------+\\n|\\n+------------+\\nSQLRowCount returns 1\\n1 rows fetched\\n$ exit\\n\\nWith unixODBC installed, configured, and verified to work, we need to recompile\\nAsterisk so that the ODBC modules are created and installed.

Even\\n\\nthe Username and Password are specified elsewhere, as seen later.\\n\\n266 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAsterisk sources directory and run the ./configure script so it knows you have installed\\nunixODBC.\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\nmake distclean\\n./configure\\nmake menuselect\\nmake install\\n\\nAlmost everything in this chapter is turned on by default. You will want\\nto run make menuselect to verify that the ODBC related modules are\\nenabled. These include cdr_odbc, func_odbc, func_realtime,\\npbx_realtime, res_config_odbc, res_odbc. For voicemail stored in an\\nODBC database, be sure to select ODBC_STORAGE from the Voicemail\\nBuild Options menu. You can verify the modules exist in the /usr/lib/\\nasterisk/modules/ directory.\\n\\nConfiguring res_odbc for Access to Our Database\\nODBC connections are configured in the res_odbc.conf file located in /etc/asterisk. The\\nres_odbc.conf file sets the parameters that the various Asterisk modules will use to\\nconnect to the database.\\nModify the res_odbc.conf file:\\n[asterisk]\\nenabled => yes\\ndsn => asterisk-connector\\nusername => asterisk\\npassword => welcome\\npooling => no\\nlimit => 0\\npre-connect => yes\\n\\nThe dsn option points at the database connection we configured in /etc/odbc.ini, and\\nthe pre-connect option tells Asterisk to open up and maintain a connection to the\\ndatabase when loading the res_odbc.so module. This lowers some of the overhead that\\nwould come from repeatedly setting up and tearing down the connection to the\\ndatabase.\\nOnce you\\'ve configured res_odbc.conf, start Asterisk and verify the database connection with the odbc show CLI command:\\n*CLI> odbc show\\nName: asterisk\\nDSN: asterisk-connector\\n The pooling and limit options are quite useful for MS SQL Server and Sybase databases. These permit you\\n\\nto establish multiple connections (up to limit connections) to a database while ensuring that each connection\\nhas only one statement executing at once (this is due to a limitation in the protocol used by these database\\nservers).\\n\\nInstalling and Configuring ODBC | 267\\n\\x0cPooled: no\\nConnected: yes\\n\\nUsing Realtime\\nThe Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) is a method of storing the configuration files\\n(that would normally be found in /etc/asterisk) and their configuration options in a\\ndatabase table. There are two types of realtime; static and dynamic. The static version\\nis similar to the traditional method of reading a configuration file, except that the data\\nis read from the database instead. The dynamic realtime method is used for things such\\nas user and peer objects (SIP, IAX2), and voicemail which loads and updates the information as it is required. Changes to static information requires a reload just as if you\\nhad changed the text file on the system, but dynamic information is polled by Asterisk\\nas needed and requires no reload. Realtime is configured in the extconfig.conf file located in the /etc/asterisk directory. This file tells Asterisk what to load from the database\\nand where to load it from, allowing certain files to be loaded from the database and\\nother files to be loaded from the standard configuration files.\\n\\nStatic Realtime\\nStatic realtime is used when you want to store the configuration that you would normally place in the configuration files in /etc/asterisk but want to load from a database.\\nThe same rules that apply to flat files on your system still apply when using static\\nrealtime, such as requiring you to either run the reload command from the Asterisk\\nCLI, or to reload the module associated with the configuration file (i.e., module reload\\nchan_sip.so).\\n\\nUsing the preload Directive\\nMost files are able to be loaded via static realtime, but a few files are not able to be\\nloaded using this method. These include asterisk.conf, extconfig.conf, and logger.conf.\\nAdditionally, the files manager.conf, cdr.conf, and rtp.conf cannot be loaded from static\\nrealtime unless the storage drivers are loaded before the main Asterisk core initializes\\n(this is because the configuration files need to be loaded by realtime before the module\\ngoes to read its configuration). Since we are using ODBC in this chapter, we would\\nneed to add the following lines to modules.conf:\\n; /etc/asterisk/modules.conf\\npreload => res_odbc.so\\npreload => res_config_odbc.so\\n\\n268 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cWhen using static realtime, we tell Asterisk which files we want to load from the database using the following syntax in the extconfig.conf file:\\n; /etc/asterisk/extconfig.conf\\nfilename.conf => driver,database[,table]\\n\\nIf the table name is not specified, then Asterisk will use the name of the\\nfile instead.\\n\\nThe static realtime module uses a specifically formatted table to read the configuration\\nof static files in from the database. You can define the table for static realtime in PostgreSQL as follows:\\nCREATE TABLE ast_config\\n(\\nid serial NOT NULL,\\ncat_metric int4 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nvar_metric int4 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nfilename varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\ncategory varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'default\\'::character varying,\\nvar_name varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\nvar_val varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT \\'\\'::character varying,\\ncommented int2 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\\nCONSTRAINT ast_config_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nA brief explanation about the columns is required in order to understand how Asterisk\\ntakes the rows from the database and applies them to the configuration for the various\\nmodules you may load:\\ncat_metric\\n\\nThe weight of the category within the file. A lower metric means it appears higher\\nin the file (see the sidebar \"A Word About Metrics\").\\nvar_metric\\n\\nThe weight of an item within a category. A lower metric means it appears higher\\nin the list. This is useful for things like codec order in sip.conf or iax.conf where\\nyou want disallow=all to appear first (metric of 0), followed by allow=ulaw (metric\\nof 1), then by allow=gsm (metric of 2) (see the sidebar \"A Word About Metrics\").\\nfilename\\n\\nThe filename the module would normally read from the hard drive of your system\\n(i.e., musiconhold.conf, sip.conf, iax.conf, etc.).\\ncategory\\n\\nThe section name within the file, such as [general], but don\\'t save to the database\\nusing the square brackets.\\n\\nUsing Realtime | 269\\n\\x0cvar_name\\n\\nThe option on the left side of the equals sign (i.e., disallow is the var_name in\\ndisallow=all).\\nvar_val\\n\\nThe value to an option on the right side of the equals sign (i.e., all is the var_val\\nin disallow=all).\\ncommented\\n\\nAny value other than 0 will evaluate as if it were prefixed with a semicolon in the\\nflat file (commented out).\\n\\nA Word About Metrics\\nThe metrics in static realtime are used to control the order that objects are read into\\nmemory. Think of the cat_metric and var_metric as the original line numbers in the\\nflat file. A higher cat_metric is processed first (because Asterisk matches categories from\\nbottom to topthis is why the order of users and peers can matter in sip.conf or\\niax.conf). A lower var_metric is processed first within the category because Asterisk will\\nprocess the order of options top-down within the category (e.g., disallow=all should\\nbe set to a value lower than the allow\\'s value within the category to make sure it is\\nprocessed first).\\n\\nA simple file we can load from static realtime is the musiconhold.conf file. Let\\'s start by\\nmoving this file to a temporary location:\\n# cd /etc/asterisk\\n# mv musiconhold.conf musiconhold.conf.old\\n\\nIn order for the classes to be removed from memory, we need to restart Asterisk. Then\\nwe can verify our classes are blank by running moh show classes:\\n*CLI> restart now\\n*CLI> moh show classes\\n*CLI>\\n\\nSo let\\'s put the [default] class back into Asterisk, but now we\\'ll load it from the database. Connect to PostgreSQL and execute the following INSERT statements:\\nINSERT\\nVALUES\\nINSERT\\nVALUES\\n\\nINTO ast_config (filename,category,var_name,var_val)\\n(\\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\'general\\',\\'mode\\',\\'files\\');\\nINTO ast_config (filename,category,var_name,var_val)\\n(\\'musiconhold.conf\\',\\'general\\',\\'directory\\',\\'/var/lib/asterisk/moh\\');\\n\\nYou can verify your values have made it into the database by running a SELECT statement:\\nasterisk=# select filename,category,var_name,var_val from ast_config;\\nfilename\\n| category\\n| var_name\\n| var_val\\n------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------------musiconhold.conf | general\\n| mode\\n| files\\n\\n270 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cmusiconhold.conf | general\\n\\n| directory\\n\\n| /var/lib/asterisk/moh\\n\\nAnd now, there\\'s just one last thing to modify in the extconfig.conf file in /etc/asterisk\\ndirectory to tell Asterisk to get the data for musiconhold.conf from the database. Add\\nthe following line to the end of the extconfig.conf file, then save it:\\nmusiconhold.conf => odbc,asterisk,ast_config\\n\\nThen connect to the Asterisk console and perform a reload:\\n*CLI> module reload\\n\\nYou can now verify that we have our music-on-hold classes loading from the database\\nby running moh show classes:\\n*CLI> moh show classes\\nClass: general\\nMode: files\\nDirectory: /var/lib/asterisk/moh\\n\\nAnd there you go; musiconhold.conf loaded from the database. You can perform the\\nsame steps in order to load other flat files from the database!\\n\\nDynamic Realtime\\nThe dynamic realtime system is used to load objects that may change often: SIP/IAX2\\nusers and peers, queues and their members, and voicemail. Since this information in\\nthe system may either be changing or new records are being added on a regular basis,\\nwe can utilize the power of the database to let us load this information on an as-needed\\nbasis.\\nAll of realtime is configured in the /etc/asterisk/extconfig.conf file, but dynamic realtime\\nhas well-defined configuration names such as sippeers. Defining something like SIP\\npeers is done with the following format:\\n; extconfig.conf\\nsippeers => driver,database[,table]\\n\\nThe table name is optional, in which case Asterisk will use the predefined name (i.e.,\\nsippeers) as the table to look up the data. In our example, we\\'ll be using the ast_sip\\npeers table to store our SIP peer information.\\nRemember that we have both SIP peers and SIP users; peers are endpoints we send calls to, and a user is something we receive calls from.\\nA friend is shorthand that defines both.\\n\\nSo to configure Asterisk to load all SIP peers from a database using realtime, we would\\ndefine something like:\\n\\nUsing Realtime | 271\\n\\x0c; extconfig.conf\\nsippeers => odbc,asterisk,ast_sipfriends\\n\\nTo also load our SIP users from the database, define it like so:\\nsipusers => odbc,asterisk,ast_sipfriends\\n\\nYou may have noticed we used the same table for both the sippeers and sipusers. This\\nis because there will be a type field (just as if you had defined the type in the sip.conf\\nfile) that will let us define a type of user, peer, or friend. When defining the table for\\nSIP users and peers, we need at least the following:\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n|name |host\\n|secret | ipaddr | port| regseconds | username |\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n|dynamic |welcome|\\n|\\n|\\n+------+--------+-------+--------+-----+------------+----------+\\n\\nThe port, regseconds, and ipaddr fields are required to let Asterisk store the registration\\ninformation for the peer in order to know where to send the call. This is assuming the\\nhost is dynamic; however, if the peer is static, we would have to populate the ipaddr\\nfield ourselves. The port field is optional and would use the default standard port defined in the [general] section, and the regseconds would remain blank.) There are many\\nmore options for a SIP friend that we can define, such as the caller ID, and adding that\\ninformation is as simple as adding the callerid column to the table. See the\\nsip.conf.sample file for more options that can be defined for SIP friends.\\n\\nStoring Call Detail Records\\nCall Detail Records (CDR) contain information about calls that have passed through\\nyour Asterisk system. They are discussed further in Chapter 13. This is a popular use\\nof databases in Asterisk because CDR can be easier to manage if you store the records\\nin a database (for example, you could keep track of many Asterisk systems in a single\\ntable).\\n\\nSetting the systemname for Globally Unique IDs\\nCDRs consist of a unique identifier and several fields of information about the call\\n(including source and destination channel, length of call, last application executed and\\nso forth). In a clustered set of Asterisk boxes, it is theoretically possible to have duplication among unique identifiers since each Asterisk system considers only itself. To\\naddress this, we can automatically append a system identifier to the front of the unique\\nID by adding an option to /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf. For each of your boxes, set an\\nidentifier by adding something like:\\n[options]\\nsystemname=toronto\\n\\n272 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cLet\\'s create a table in our database to store CDR. Log in to the PostgreSQL server with\\nthe psql application:\\n# psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\nAnd create the asterisk_cdr table:\\nasterisk=> CREATE TABLE asterisk_cdr\\n(\\nid bigserial NOT NULL,\\ncalldate timestamptz,\\nCONSTRAINT asterisk_cdr_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nYou can verify the table was created by using the \\\\dt command (describe tables):\\nasterisk=> \\\\dt asterisk_cdr\\nList of relations\\nSchema |\\nName\\n| Type | Owner\\n--------+--------------+-------+---------public | asterisk_cdr | table | asterisk\\n\\nNext, configure Asterisk to store its CDR into the database. This is done in the /etc/\\nasterisk/cdr_odbc.conf file with the following configuration:\\n[global]\\ndsn=asterisk-connector\\nusername=asterisk\\npassword=welcome\\nloguniqueid=yes\\ntable=asterisk_cdr\\n\\nStoring Call Detail Records | 273\\n\\x0cIf Asterisk is already running, from the Asterisk CLI execute module reload\\ncdr_odbc.so. You can also just type reload, to reload everything.\\n*CLI> reload\\n\\nVerify the status of CDR by entering the following command and looking for\\nCDR registered backend: ODBC:\\n*CLI> cdr status\\nCDR logging: enabled\\nCDR mode: simple\\nCDR registered backend: cdr-custom\\nCDR registered backend: cdr_manager\\nCDR registered backend: ODBC\\n\\nNow, perform a call through your Asterisk box and verify you have data in the asterisk_cdr table. The easiest way to test a call is with the Asterisk CLI command console\\ndial (assuming that you have a sound card and chan_oss installed). However, you can\\nutilize any method at your disposal to place a test call:\\n*CLI> console dial 100@default\\n-- Executing [100@default:1] Playback(\"OSS/dsp\", \"tt-weasels\") in new stack\\n-- <OSS/dsp> Playing \\'tt-weasels\\' (language \\'en\\')\\n\\nThen connect to the database and perform a SELECT statement to verify you have data\\nin the asterisk_cdr table. You could also do SELECT * FROM asterisk_cdr;, but that\\nwill return a lot more data:\\n# psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\nasterisk=> SELECT id,dst,channel,uniqueid,calldate FROM asterisk_cdr;\\nid | dst | channel |\\nuniqueid\\n|\\ncalldate\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking\\nThe func_odbc dialplan function is arguably the coolest and most powerful dialplan\\nfunction in Asterisk. It allows you to create and use fairly simple dialplan functions that\\nretrieve and use information from databases directly in the dialplan. There are all kinds\\nof ways in which this might be used, such as managing users or allowing sharing of\\ndynamic information within a clustered set of Asterisk machines.\\nWhat func_odbc allows you to do is define SQL queries to which you assign function\\nnames. In effect, you are creating custom functions that obtain their results by executing\\nqueries against a database. The func_odbc.conf file is where you specify the relationship\\nbetween the function names you create and the SQL statements you wish them to\\nperform. By referring to the named function in the dialplan, you can retrieve and update\\nvalues in the database.\\n274 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cWhile using an external script to interact with a database (from which\\na flat file is created that Asterisk would read) has advantages (if the\\ndatabase went down, your system would continue to function and the\\nscript would simply not update any files until connectivity to the database was restored), a major disadvantage is that any changes you make\\nto a user are not available until you run the update script. This is probably not a big issue on small systems, but on large systems, waiting for\\nchanges to take effect can cause issues, such as pausing a live call while\\na large file is loaded and parsed.\\nYou can relieve some of this by utilizing a replicated database system.\\nIn the version of Asterisk following 1.4 (currently trunk), the syntax of\\nthe func_odbc.conf file changes slightly, but gives the ability to failover\\nto another database system. This way you can cluster the database\\nbackend utilizing a master-master relationship (pgcluster; Slony-II), or\\na master-slave (Slony-I) replication system.\\n\\nIn order to get you into the right frame of mind for what follows, we want you to picture\\na Dagwood sandwich.\\nCan you relay the total experience of such a thing by showing someone a picture of a\\ntomato, or by waving a slice of cheese about? Not hardly. That is the conundrum we\\nfaced when trying to give a useful example of why func_odbc is so powerful. So, we\\ndecided to build the whole sandwich for you. It\\'s quite a mouthful, but after a few bites\\nof this, peanut butter and jelly is never going to be the same.\\nFor our example, we decided to implement something that we think could have some\\npractical uses. Let\\'s picture a small company with a sales force of five people who have\\nto share two desks. This is not as cruel as it seems, because these folks spend most of\\ntheir time on the road, and they are each only in the office for at most one day each week.\\nStill, when they do get into the office, they\\'d like the system to know which desk they\\nare sitting at, so that their calls can be directed there. Also, the boss wants to be able\\nto track when they are in the office, and control calling privileges from those phones\\nwhen no one is there.\\nThis need is typically solved by what is called a hot-desking feature, so we have built\\none for you in order to show you the power of func_odbc.\\nLets start with the easy stuff, and create two desktop phones in the sip.conf file.\\n; sip.conf\\n; HOT DESK USERS\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=hotdesk\\n And if you don\\'t know what a Dagwood is, that\\'s what Wikipedia is for. I am not that old.\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 275\\n\\x0cqualify=yes\\ntype=friend\\nhost=dynamic\\nsecret=my_special_secret\\ncontext=hotdesk\\nqualify=yes\\n; END HOT DESK USERS\\n\\nThese two desk phones both enter the dialplan at the [hotdesk] context in exten\\nsions.conf. If you want to have these devices actually work, you will of course need to\\nset the appropriate parameters in the devices themselves, but we\\'ve covered all that in\\nChapter 4.\\nThat\\'s all for sip.conf. We\\'ve got two slices of bread. Hardly a sandwich yet.\\nNow let\\'s get the database part of it set up (we are assuming that you have an ODBC\\ndatabase created and working as outlined in the earlier parts of this chapter). First,\\nconnect to the database console like so:\\n# su - postgres\\n$ psql -U asterisk -h localhost asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\nThen create the table with the following bit of code:\\nCREATE TABLE ast_hotdesk\\n(\\nid serial NOT NULL,\\nfirst_name text,\\nlast_name text,\\ncid_name text,\\ncontext text,\\nstatus bool DEFAULT false,\\n\"location\" text,\\nCONSTRAINT ast_hotdesk_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)\\n)\\nWITHOUT OIDS;\\n\\nAfter that, we populated the database with the following information (some of the\\nvalues that you see actually would change only after the dialplan work is done, but we\\nhave it in here by way of example). At the PostgreSQL console, run the following\\ncommands:\\nasterisk=> INSERT INTO ast_hotdesk (\\'extension\\', \\'first_name\\', \\'last_name\\', \\'cid_name\\',\\n\\'cid_number\\', \\'pin\\', \\'context\\', \\'location\\') \\\\\\nVALUES (1101, \\'Leif\\', \\'Madsen\\', \\'Leif Madsen\\', \\'4165551101\\', \\'555\\', \\'longdistance\\',\\n\\n276 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cRepeat the previous line and change the VALUES for all entries you wish to have in the\\ndatabase. You can view the data in the ast_hotdesk table by running a simple SELECT\\nstatement from the PostgreSQL console:\\nasterisk=> SELECT * FROM ast_hostdesk;\\n\\nwhich would give you something like the following output:\\n| id | extension | first_name | last_name\\n| cid_name\\n| cid_number\\n| pin\\n| \"Leif\"\\n| \"Madsen\"\\n| \"Leif Madsen\"\\n| \"Jim\"\\n| \"Van Meggelen\" | \"Jim Van Meggelen\" | \"4165551102\" | \"556\"\\n| \"Jared\"\\n| \"Smith\"\\n| \"Jared Smith\"\\n| \"Mark\"\\n| \"Spencer\"\\n| \"Mark Spencer\"\\n| \"Kevin\"\\n| \"Fleming\"\\n| \"Kevin Fleming\"\\n| context\\n| status | location |$\\n+-----------------+---------+----------+\\n| \"longdistance\" | \"TRUE\" | \"desk_1\" |\\n| \"longdistance\" | \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"local\"\\n| \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"international\" | \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n| \"local\"\\n| \"FALSE\" | \"\"\\n|\\n\\nWe\\'ve got the condiments now, so let\\'s get to our dialplan. This is where the magic is\\ngoing to happen.\\nBefore you start typing, take note that we have placed all of the sample\\ntext that follows in appendix H, so while we encourage you to follow\\nus along through the examples, you can also see what it all looks like as\\na whole, by checking the appendix (and by copying and pasting, if you\\nhave an electronic version of this book).\\n\\nSomewhere in extensions.conf we are going to have to create the [hotdesk] context. To\\nstart, let\\'s define a pattern-match extension that will allow the users to log in:\\n; extensions.conf\\n; Hot Desking Feature\\n[hotdesk]\\n; Hot Desk Login\\nexten => _110[1-5],1,NoOp()\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Verbose(1|Hot Desk Extension ${E} is changing status)\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Verbose(1|Checking current status of extension ${E})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\n\\nWe\\'re not done writing this extension yet, but let\\'s pause for a moment and see where\\nwe\\'re at so far.\\nWhen a sales agent sits down at a desk, they log in by dialing their own extension\\nnumber. In this case we have allowed the 1101 through 1105 extensions to log in with\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 277\\n\\x0cour pattern match of _110[1-5]. You could just as easily make this less restrictive by\\nusing _11XX (allowing 1100 through 1199). This extension uses func_odbc to perform\\na lookup with the HOTDESK_INFO() dialplan function (which we will be creating shortly).\\nThis custom function (which we define in the func_odbc.conf file) performs an SQL\\nstatement and returns whatever is retrieved from the database.\\nWe would define the new function HOTDESK_INFO() in func_odbc.conf like so:\\n[INFO]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nread=SELECT ${ARG1} FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE extension = \\'${ARG2}\\'\\n\\nThat\\'s a lot of stuff in just a few lines. Let\\'s quickly cover them before we move on.\\nFirst of all, the prefix is optional. If you don\\'t configure the prefix, then Asterisk adds\\n\"ODBC\" to the name of the function (in this case INFO), which means this function\\nwould become ODBC_INFO(). This is not very descriptive of what the function is doing,\\nso it can be helpful to assign a prefix that helps to relate your ODBC functions to the\\ntask they are performing. In this case we chose HOTDESK, which means that this\\ncustom function will be named HOTDESK_INFO.\\nThe dsn attribute tells Asterisk which connection to use from res_odbc.conf. Since several database connections could be configured in res_odbc.conf, we specify which one\\nto use here. In Figure 12-1, we show the relationship between the various file configurations and how they reference down the chain to connect to the database.\\nWe then define our SQL statement with the read attribute. Dialplan functions have two\\ndifferent formats that they can be called with: one for retrieving information, and one\\nfor setting information. The read attribute is used when we call the HOTDESK_INFO()\\nfunction with the retrieve format (and we could execute a separate SQL statement with\\nthe write attribute; we\\'ll discuss the format for the write attribute a little bit later in\\nthis chapter).\\nReading values from this function would take the format in the dialplan like so:\\nexten => s,n,Set(RETURNED_VALUE=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,1101)})\\n\\nThis would return the value located in the database within the status column where\\nthe extension column equals 1101. The status and 1101 we pass to the\\nHOTDESK_INFO() function are then placed into the SQL statement we assigned to the\\nread attribute, available as ${ARG1} and ${ARG2}, respectively. If we had passed a third\\noption, this would have been available as ${ARG3}.\\n\\n278 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAsterisk\\nfunc_odbc.conf\\n[INFO]\\nprefix=hotdesk\\ndsn=asterisk\\nreadsql=...\\n\\nLinux\\n\\nres_odbc.conf\\n\\n[asterisk]\\nenabled=>yes\\ndsn=>PostgreSQL-asterisk\\npre-connect=>yes\\n\\n/etc/odbc/ini\\n\\ndatabase\\n\\n[PostgreSQL-asterisk]\\nDescription =Aserisk pgsql connection\\nServername =localhost\\n\\nFigure 12-1. Relationships between func_odbc.conf, res_odbc.conf, /etc/odbc.ini (unixODBC), and\\nthe database connection\\nBe sure that your data is unique enough that you only get a single row\\nback. If more than one row is returned, Asterisk will see only the first\\nrow returned. With PostgreSQL, you could add a LIMIT 1 to the end\\nof your SQL statement to limit a single row being returned, but this is\\nnot a good practice to rely on. A little further into this section we\\'ll see\\nhow we can use the LIMIT and OFFSET PostgreSQL functions to loop\\nthrough multiple rows of data!\\n\\nAfter the SQL statement is executed, the value returned (if any) is assigned to the\\nRETURNED_VALUE channel variable.\\n\\nUsing the ARRAY() function\\nIn our example, we are utilizing two separate database calls and assigning those values\\nto a pair of channel variables, (${E}_STATUS and ${E}_PIN). This was done to simplify\\nthe example:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\n\\nAs an alternative, we could have returned multiple columns and saved them to separate\\nvariables utilizing the ARRAY() dialplan function. If we had defined our SQL statement\\nin the func_odbc.conf file like so:\\nread=SELECT pin,status FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE extension = \\'${E}\\'\\n\\nthen we could use the ARRAY() function to save each column of information for the row\\nto its own variable with a single call to the database:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(ARRAY(${E}_PIN,${E}_STATUS)=${HOTDESK_INFO(${E})})\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 279\\n\\x0cSo, in the first two lines of our following block of code we are passing the value\\nstatus, and the value contained in the ${E} variable (e.g., 1101) to the HOTDESK_INFO\\n() function. The two values are then replaced in the SQL statement with ${ARG1} and\\n${ARG2}, respectfully, the SQL statement is executed, and the value returned is assigned\\nto the ${E}_STATUS channel variable.\\nOK, let\\'s finish writing the pattern-match extension now:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_STATUS=${HOTDESK_INFO(status,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,Set(${E}_PIN=${HOTDESK_INFO(pin,${E})})\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${${E}_STATUS})}]?invalid_user,1)\\n; check if ${E}_STATUS is NULL\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${${E}_STATUS} = 1]?logout,1:login,1)\\n\\nAfter assigning the value of the status column to the ${E}_STATUS variable (if you dialed\\nextension 1101, then the variable name would be 1101_STATUS), we check if we received\\na value back from the database (error checking). We make use of the ISNULL() function\\nto perform this check.\\nThe last row in the block checks the status of the phone, and if currently logged in, will\\nlog off the agent. If not already logged in, it will go to extension login, priority 1 within\\nthe same context.\\nIn the version following 1.4 (currently trunk) you can use the\\n${ODBCROWS} channel variable with statements executed by a readsql.\\nWe could have replaced the GotoIf() with something like:\\nexten => _110[1-5],n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 0]?invalid_user,1)\\n\\nThe login extension runs some initial checks to verify the pin code entered by the agent.\\nWe allow him three tries to enter the correct pin, and if invalid, will send the call to the\\nlogin_fail extension (which we will be writing later on).\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogin,1,NoOp() ; set counter initial value\\nlogin,n,Set(PIN_TRIES=0) ; set max number of login attempts\\nlogin,n(get_pin),NoOp() ; increase pin try counter\\nlogin,n,Set(PIN_TRIES=$[${PIN_TRIES} + 1])\\nlogin,n,Read(PIN_ENTERED|enter-password|${LEN(${${E}_PIN})})\\nlogin,n,GotoIf($[${PIN_ENTERED} = ${${E}_PIN}]?valid_login,1)\\nlogin,n,Playback(invalid-pin)\\n\\n Remember that in a traditional phone system all extensions must be numbers, but in Asterisk, extensions\\n\\ncan have names as well. A possible advantage of using an extension that\\'s not a number is that it will be much\\nharder for a user to dial it from her phone and, thus, more secure. We\\'re going to use several named extensions\\nin this example. If you want to be absolutely sure that a malicious user cannot access those named extensions,\\nsimply use the trick that the AEL loader uses: start with a priority other than 1.\\n\\n280 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cIf the pin entered matches, we validate the login with the valid_login extension. First\\nwe utilize the CHANNEL variable to figure out which phone device we\\'re calling from. The\\nCHANNEL variable is usually populated with something such as: SIP/desk_1-ab4034c, so\\nwe make use of the CUT() function to first pull off the SIP/ portion of the string and\\nassign that to LOCATION. We then strip off the -ab4034c part of the string, discard it, and\\nassign the remainder of desk_1 to the LOCATION variable.\\nexten\\n; CUT\\nexten\\n; CUT\\nexten\\n\\noff the channel technology and assign to the LOCATION variable\\noff the unique identifier and save the remainder to the LOCATION variable\\n\\nWe utilize yet another custom function, HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_LOGINS(), created in\\nfunc_odbc.conf to check if any other users were previously logged in to this phone and\\nhad forgotten to log out. If the number of previously logged in users was greater than\\n0 (and should only ever be 1, but we check for more anyway and reset those, too), it\\nruns the logic in the logout_login extension.\\nIf no previous agents were logged in, we update the login status for this user with the\\nHOTDESK_STATUS() function:\\nexten => valid_login,n,Set(ARRAY(USERS_LOGGED_IN)=${HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_\\nLOGINS(${LOCATION})})\\nexten => valid_login,n,GotoIf($[${USERS_LOGGED_IN} > 0]?logout_login,1)\\nexten => valid_login,n(set_login_status),NoOp()\\n; Set the status for the phone to \\'1\\' and where we\\'re logged into\\n; NOTE: we need to escape the comma here because the Set() application has arguments\\nexten => valid_login,n,Set(HOTDESK_STATUS(${E})=1\\\\,${LOCATION})\\nexten => valid_login,n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 1]?error,1)\\nexten => valid_login,n,Playback(agent-loginok)\\nexten => valid_login,n,Hangup()\\n\\nWe create a write function in func_odbc.conf like so:\\n[STATUS]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nwrite=UPDATE ast_hotdesk SET status = \\'${VAL1}\\', location = \\'${VAL2}\\' WHERE extension\\n\\nThe syntax is very similar to the read syntax discussed earlier in the chapter, but there\\nare a few new things here, so let\\'s discuss them before moving on.\\nThe first thing you may have noticed is that we now have both ${VALx} and ${ARGx}\\nvariables in our SQL statement. These contain the values we pass to the function from\\nthe dialplan. In this case, we have two VAL variables, and a single ARG variable that were\\nset from the dialplan via this statement:\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 281\\n\\x0cBecause the Set() dialplan application can also take arguments (you can\\nset multiple variables and values by separating them with commas or\\npipes), you need to escape the comma with the backslash ( \\\\ ) so it is\\nnot processed by the expression parser for the Set() application, but\\nrather parses it for the HOTDESK_STATUS() function.\\n\\nNotice the syntax is slightly different from that of the read style function. This signals\\nto Asterisk that you want to perform a write (this is the same syntax as other dialplan\\nfunctions).\\nWe are passing the value of the ${E} variable to the HOTDESK_STATUS() function, whose\\nvalue is then accessible in the SQL statement within func_odbc.conf with the ${ARG1}\\nvariable. We then pass two values: 1 and ${LOCATION}. These are available to the SQL\\nstatement in the ${VAL1} and ${VAL2} variables, respectively.\\nAs mentioned previously, if we had to log out one or more agents before logging in, we\\nwould check this with the logout_login extension. This dialplan logic will utilize the\\nWhile() application to loop through the database and perform any database correction\\nthat may need to occur. More than likely this will execute only one loop, but it\\'s a good\\nexample of how you might update or parse multiple rows in the database:\\nexten\\n; set\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\nall logged in users on this device to logged out status\\n=> logout_login,n,While($[${ROW_COUNTER} < ${USERS_LOGGED_IN}])\\n\\nThe ${USERS_LOGGED_IN} variable was set previously with the HOTDESK_CHECK_PHONE_LOG\\nINS() function, which assigned a value of 1 or greater. We did this by counting the\\nnumber of rows that were affected:\\n; func_odbc.conf\\n[CHECK_PHONE_LOGINS]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\nread=SELECT COUNT(status) FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE status = \\'1\\' AND location = \\'${ARG1}\\'\\n\\nWe then get the extension number of the user that is logged in with the HOTDESK_LOG\\nGED_IN_USER() function. The LOCATION variable is populated with desk_1, which tells us\\nwhich device we want to check on, and the ${ROW_COUNTER} contains which iteration of\\nthe loop we\\'re on. These are both passed as arguments to the dialplan function. The\\nresult is then assigned to the WHO variable:\\nexten => logout_login,n,Set(WHO=${HOTDESK_LOGGED_IN_USER(${LOCATION},${ROW_COUNTER})})\\n\\nThe HOTDESK_LOGGED_IN_USER() function then pulls a specific row out of the database\\nthat corresponds with the iteration of the loops we are trying to process:\\n[LOGGED_IN_USER]\\nprefix=HOTDESK\\ndsn=asterisk\\n\\n282 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cread=SELECT extension FROM ast_hotdesk WHERE status = \\'1\\'\\nAND location = \\'${ARG1}\\' ORDER BY id LIMIT \\'1\\' OFFSET \\'${ARG2}\\'\\n\\nNow that we know what extension we want to update, we write to the HOTDESK_STATUS\\n() function, and assign a 0 to the status column where the extension number matches\\nthe value in the ${WHO} variable (i.e., 1101). We then end the loop with EndWhile() and\\nreturn back to the valid_login extension at the set_login_status priority label (as discussed previously):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogout_login,n,Set(ROW_COUNTER=$[${ROW_COUNTER} + 1])\\nlogout_login,n,EndWhile()\\nlogout_login,n,Goto(valid_login,set_login_status)\\n\\n; logout phone\\n; return to logging in\\n\\nThe rest of the context should be fairly straightforward (if some of this doesn\\'t make\\nsense, we suggest you go back and refresh your memory with Chapter 5 and Chapter 6). The one trick you may be unfamiliar with could be the usage of the ${ODB\\nCROWS} channel variable, which is set by the HOTDESK_STATUS() function. This tells us\\nhow many rows were affected in the SQL UPDATE, which we assume to be 1. If the value\\nof ${ODBCROWS} is less than 1, then we assume an error and handle appropriately:\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nlogout,n,GotoIf($[${ODBCROWS} < 1]?error,1)\\nlogout,n,Hangup()\\n\\nexten => login_fail,1,NoOp()\\nexten => login_fail,n,Playback(silence/1&login-fail)\\nexten => login_fail,n,Hangup()\\nexten => error,1,NoOp()\\nexten => error,n,Playback(silence/1&connection-failed)\\nexten => error,n,Hangup()\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\ninvalid_user,n,Verbose(1|Hot Desk extension ${E} does not exist)\\ninvalid_user,n,Hangup()\\n\\nWe also include the hotdesk_outbound context which will handle our outgoing calls\\nafter we have logged the agent in to the system:\\ninclude => hotdesk_outbound\\n\\nThe hotdesk_outbound context utilizes many of the same principles and usage as previously discussed, so we won\\'t approach it quite so thoroughly, but essentially the\\n[hotdesk_outbound] context will catch all dialed numbers from the desk phones. We first\\nset our LOCATION variable using the CHANNEL variable, then determine which extension\\n(agent) is logged in to the system and assign it to the WHO variable. If this variable is\\nNULL, then we reject the outgoing call. If not NULL, then we get the agent information\\nusing the HOTDESK_INFO() function and assign it to several CHANNEL variables. This\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 283\\n\\x0cincludes the context to handle the call with, where we perform a Goto() to the context\\nwe have been assigned (which controls our outbound access).\\nIf we try to dial a number that is not handled by our context (or one of the transitive\\ncontexts--i.e., international contains -> long distance, which also contains -> local),\\nthen the built-in extension i is executed which plays back a message stating the action\\ncannot be performed, then hangs up the caller:\\n[hotdesk_outbound]\\nexten => _X.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(LOCATION=${CUT(CHANNEL,/,2)})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(LOCATION=${CUT(LOCATION,-,1)})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(WHO=${HOTDESK_PHONE_STATUS(${LOCATION})})\\nexten => _X.,n,GotoIf($[${ISNULL(${WHO})}]?no_outgoing,1)\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CID_NAME=${HOTDESK_INFO(cid_name,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CID_NUMBER=${HOTDESK_INFO(cid_number,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Set(${WHO}_CONTEXT=${HOTDESK_INFO(context,${WHO})})\\nexten => _X.,n,Goto(${${WHO}_CONTEXT},${EXTEN},1)\\n[international]\\nexten => _011.,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _011.,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _011.,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\ninclude => longdistance\\n[longdistance]\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Goto(1${EXTEN},1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\ninclude => local\\n[local]\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,1,NoOp()\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,n,Set(E=${EXTEN})\\nexten => _416NXXXXXX,n,Goto(outgoing,call,1)\\nexten => i,1,NoOp()\\nexten => i,n,Playback(silence/2&sorry-cant-let-you-do-that2)\\nexten => i,n,Hangup()\\n\\nIf the call is allowed to be executed, then the call is sent to the [outgoing] context for\\ncall processing, where the caller ID name and number are set with the CALLERID()\\n\\n284 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cfunction.

The complete dialplan utilized for the hot-desk feature is displayed in full\\nin Appendix G.\\nHow many things have you just thought of that you could apply func_odbc to? See why\\nwe\\'re so excited about this feature as well?!\\n\\nThe func_odbc Backport\\nWith Asterisk 1.4, you can use a backported version of func_odbc that uses a slightly\\ndifferent configuration format. This allows you to use multiple DSN connections to\\nseparate databases, and also to utilize the ${ODBCROWS} channel variable for SQL read\\n(SELECT) queries. To check out the backport of func_odbc and install it (which overwrites the existing func_odbc.c file):\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n#\\n\\ncd /usr/src/\\ncp: overwrite `./asterisk-1.4/funcs/func_odbc.c\\'? y\\nmake install\\n\\nThe version described in this chapter works with a stock Asterisk 1.4 system, but the\\nbackport (and Asterisk 1.6) will use the following syntax changes:\\n read will become readsql\\n write will become writesql\\n dsn will become readhandle and writehandle (for separate read and write database\\nlocations)\\n\\nGetting Funky with func_odbc: Hot-Desking | 285\\n\\x0c Multiple readhandles and writehandles can be listed, in order of preference, to\\nperform failover when the primary handle cannot be contacted (limit of 5)\\n prefix will remain unchanged\\nThe current syntax in Asterisk 1.4 will continue to work in the backport, but will display\\na deprecation warning in the version to follow. Support will eventually be removed.\\n\\nODBC Voicemail\\nAsterisk contains the ability to store voicemail inside the database using the ODBC\\nconnector. This is useful in a clustered environment where you want to abstract the\\nvoicemail data from the local system so that multiple Asterisk boxes have access to the\\nsame data. Of course, you have to take into consideration that you are centralizing a\\npart of Asterisk, and you need to take actions to protect that data, such as regular\\nbackups, and possibly clustering the database backend using replication. If you are\\nusing PostgreSQL, there are some good projects for doing this: PGcluster (http://pgfoun\\ndry.org/projects/pgcluster/) and Slony-I (http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/slony1/proj\\ndisplay.php).\\nAsterisk stores the voicemail inside a Binary Large Object (BLOB). When retrieving the\\ndata, it pulls the information out of the BLOB and temporarily stores it on the hard\\ndrive while it is being played back to the user. Asterisk then removes the BLOB and\\nrecords from the database when the user deletes the voicemail. Many databases, such\\nas MySQL, contain native support for BLOBs, but PostgreSQL has a couple of extra\\nsteps required to utilize this functionality that we\\'ll explore in this section. When you\\'re\\ndone, you\\'ll be able to record, play back, and delete voicemail data from the database\\njust as if it were stored on the local hard drive.\\nThis section builds upon previous configuration sections in this chapter.\\nIf you have not already done so, be sure to follow the steps in the\\n\"Installing the Database\" and \"Installing and Configuring ODBC\" sections before continuing. In the \"Installing and Configuring ODBC\"\\nsection, be sure you have enabled ODBC_STORAGE in the menuselect system\\nunder Voicemail Options.\\n\\nCreating the Large Object Type\\nWe have to tell PostgreSQL how to handle the large objects. This includes creating a\\ntrigger to clean up the data when we delete a record from the database that references\\na large object.\\nConnect to the database as the asterisk user from the console:\\n# psql -h localhost -U asterisk asterisk\\nPassword:\\n\\n286 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cAt the PostgreSQL console, run the following script to create the large object type:\\nCREATE FUNCTION loin (cstring) RETURNS lo AS \\'oidin\\' LANGUAGE internal IMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION loout (lo) RETURNS cstring AS \\'oidout\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION lorecv (internal) RETURNS lo AS \\'oidrecv\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE FUNCTION losend (lo) RETURNS bytea AS \\'oidrecv\\' LANGUAGE internal\\nIMMUTABLE STRICT;\\nCREATE TYPE lo ( INPUT = loin, OUTPUT = loout, RECEIVE = lorecv, SEND = losend,\\nINTERNALLENGTH = 4, PASSEDBYVALUE );\\nCREATE CAST (lo AS oid) WITHOUT FUNCTION AS IMPLICIT;\\nCREATE CAST (oid AS lo) WITHOUT FUNCTION AS IMPLICIT;\\n\\nWe\\'ll be making use of the PostgreSQL procedural language called pgSQL/PL to create\\na function. This function will be called from a trigger that gets executed whenever we\\nmodify or delete a record from the table used to store voicemail. This is so the data is\\ncleaned up and not left as an orphan in the database:\\nCREATE FUNCTION vm_lo_cleanup() RETURNS \"trigger\"\\nAS $$\\ndeclare\\nmsgcount INTEGER;\\nbegin\\n-- raise notice \\'Starting lo_cleanup function for large object with oid\\n%\\',old.recording;\\n-- If it is an update action but the BLOB (lo) field was not changed,\\ndont do anything\\nif (TG_OP = \\'UPDATE\\') then\\nif ((old.recording = new.recording) or (old.recording is NULL)) then\\nraise notice \\'Not cleaning up the large object table,\\nas recording has not changed\\';\\nreturn new;\\nend if;\\nend if;\\nif (old.recording IS NOT NULL) then\\nSELECT INTO msgcount COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM voicemessages WHERE recording\\n= old.recording;\\nif (msgcount > 0) then\\nraise notice \\'Not deleting record from the large object table, as object is\\nstill referenced\\';\\nreturn new;\\nelse\\nperform lo_unlink(old.recording);\\nif found then\\nraise notice \\'Cleaning up the large object table\\';\\nreturn new;\\nelse\\nraise exception \\'Failed to cleanup the large object table\\';\\nreturn old;\\nend if;\\nend if;\\nelse\\nraise notice \\'No need to cleanup the large object table, no recording on old row\\';\\n\\nODBC Voicemail | 287\\n\\x0creturn new;\\nend if;\\nend$$\\nLANGUAGE plpgsql;\\n\\nWe\\'re going to create a table called voicemessages where the voicemail information will\\nbe stored:\\nCREATE TABLE voicemessages\\n(\\nuniqueid serial PRIMARY KEY,\\nrecording lo,\\n\"read\" bool DEFAULT false\\n);\\n\\nAnd now we need to associate a trigger with our newly created table in order to perform\\ncleanup whenever we make a change or deletion from the voicemessages table:\\nCREATE TRIGGER vm_cleanup AFTER DELETE OR UPDATE ON voicemessages FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE\\nPROCEDURE vm_lo_cleanup();\\n\\nConfiguring voicemail.conf for ODBC Storage\\nThere isn\\'t much to add to the voicemail.conf file to enable the ODBC voicemail storage.\\nIn fact, it\\'s only three lines! Generally, you probably have multiple format types defined\\nin the [general] section of voicemail.conf, however we need to set this to a single format.\\nThe wav49 format is a compressed WAV file format that should be playable on both\\nLinux and Microsoft Windows desktops.\\nThe odbcstorage option points at the name you defined in the res_odbc.conf file (if\\nyou\\'ve been following along in this chapter, then we called it asterisk). The odbctable\\noption refers to the table where voicemail information should be stored. In the examples\\nin this chapter we use the table named voicemessages:\\n[general]\\nodbcstorage=asterisk\\nodbctable=voicemessages\\n\\nYou may want to create a separate voicemail context, or you can utilize the default\\nvoicemail context:\\n[default]\\n\\n288 | Chapter 12: Relational Database Integration\\n\\x0cNow connect to your Asterisk console and unload then reload the app_voicemail.so\\nmodule:\\n*CLI> module unload app_voicemail.so\\n== Unregistered application \\'VoiceMail\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'VoiceMailMain\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'MailboxExists\\'\\n== Unregistered application \\'VMAuthenticate\\'\\n*CLI> module load app_voicemail.so\\nLoaded /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/app_voicemail.so => (Comedian Mail (Voicemail System))\\n== Registered application \\'VoiceMail\\'\\n== Registered application \\'VoiceMailMain\\'\\n== Registered application \\'MailboxExists\\'\\n== Registered application \\'VMAuthenticate\\'\\n== Parsing \\'/etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf\\': Found\\n\\nAnd verify that your new mailbox loaded successfully:\\n*CLI> voicemail show users for default\\nContext\\nMbox User\\ndefault\\n1000 J.P.

The source code has to be useful for something,\\nafter all.\\n--Larry Wall\\n\\nWhile there is a cornucopia of creative things that you are going to want to do with\\nyour spanking-new Asterisk system, there are also some basic, unglamorous, dare we\\nsay, boring things that need to be discussed.\\n\\nCall Detail Recording\\nWithout even being told, Asterisk assumes that you want to store CDR information.*\\nBy default, Asterisk will create a CSV file and place it in the folder /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/. To the naked eye, this file looks like a bit of a mess. If,\\nhowever, you separate each line according to the commas, you will find that each line\\ncontains information about a particular call, and that the commas separate the following values:\\naccountcode\\n\\nAssigned if configured for the channel in the channel configuration file (i.e.,\\nsip.conf). The account code is assigned on a per-channel basis. You can also change\\nthis value from the dialplan by setting CDR(accountcode).\\nsrc\\n\\nReceived Caller ID (string, 80 characters).\\n* If you are wondering why such an obviously simple thing seems to be such an achievement, the reason is\\n\\nsimply that many traditional PBXes do not have this capability built in. With those systems, you have to\\npurchase some sort of third-party appliance even just to capture the raw call data. Asterisk simply stores it.\\nNo drama. No cost. No kidding.\\n A Comma Separated Values (CSV) file is a common method of formatting database-type information in a\\n\\ntext file. You can open CSV files with a text editor, but most spreadsheet and database programs will also\\nread them and properly parse them into rows and columns.\\n\\n\\x0cdst\\n\\nDestination extension.\\ndcontext\\n\\nDestination context.\\nclid\\n\\nCaller ID with text (80 characters).\\nchannel\\n\\nChannel used (80 characters).\\ndstchannel\\n\\nDestination channel, if appropriate (80 characters).\\nlastapp\\n\\nLast application, if appropriate (80 characters).\\nlastdata\\n\\nLast application data (arguments, 80 characters).\\nstart\\n\\nStart of call (date/time).\\nanswer\\n\\nAnswer of call (date/time).\\nend\\n\\nEnd of call (date/time).\\nduration\\n\\nTotal time in system, in seconds (integer), from dial to hangup.\\nbillsec\\n\\nTotal time call is up, in seconds (integer), from answer to hangup.\\ndisposition\\n\\nWhat happened to the call (ANSWERED, NO ANSWER, BUSY).\\namaflags\\n\\nWhat flags to use (DOCUMENTATION, BILL, IGNORE, etc.), specified on a per-channel\\nbasis, like accountcode.

Asterisk currently supports SQLite, PostgreSQL,\\nMySQL, and unixODBC, but we will cover only ODBC in this book (see Chapter 12).\\nMany people prefer to store their CDRs in a database, so that queries can be run to help\\nwith billing and resource management.\\n\\n294 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cManaging Logs\\nAsterisk activity generates events that will cause the creation of an entry in either the\\nmain system logs, or in Asterisk\\'s own logfiles. On a busy system (or a system that is\\nexperiencing a severe problem), these logfiles can grow very large, very quickly. If debugging is turned on, the processes involved in writing to these logfiles can begin to\\nhave an effect on system performance. By default, Asterisk will simply add to the files\\nuntil the hard drive is full. Fortunately, Linux provides utilities to handle the rotation\\nof logfiles (so that no single file becomes too large), and also the deletion of older logfiles\\n(which will prevent the system from getting clogged with logfiles).\\nThe logrotate utility is normally run once per day by the operating system. Unfortunately, since there is no script installed to instruct logrotate on how to handle Asterisk,\\nits logfiles will grow unchecked until a rotate script is added to handle them. In order\\nto make that happen, we need to set up parameters for Asterisk in a file in the /etc/\\nlogrotate.d directory. This file will need to rotate the current logfile, and then send\\nAsterisk instructions to rotate its own logger (causing it to stop using the now old logfile,\\nand generate a new file).\\nCreate a new file /etc/logrotate.d/asterisk and place the following lines in it:\\n/var/log/asterisk/* /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv {\\nmissingok\\nsharedscripts\\nmonthly\\npostrotate\\nasterisk -rx \"logger rotate\" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null\\nendscript\\n}\\n\\nThis file tells the logrotate utility to rotate the Asterisk logs every month, save 12 months\\nworth of logs, and then tell Asterisk that the logfiles have been rotated (which will cause\\nAsterisk to create new logfiles and begin writing to them). We selected these values\\narbitrarily. Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.\\n\\nRunning Asterisk As a Non-root User\\nBy default, Asterisk runs as the root user, and while we don\\'t have any hard data, our\\nown experiences lead us to conclude that the vast majority of Asterisk systems are run\\nin this default state. From a security perspective, this represents an unacceptable\\nriskstrangely, one which most of us seem willing to take.\\nRunning Asterisk as non-root is not terribly hard to achieve, but it requires a few extra\\nsteps, and debugging it can be frustrating if you do not understand how Linux permissions work. However, from a security perspective it is well worth the effort.\\n\\nManaging Logs | 295\\n\\x0cWe\\'re going to run Asterisk as the user asterisk, so we need to create that user on our\\nsystem first. The following commands will be run as root. We\\'ll tell you when to switch\\nand use the asterisk user that we\\'re about to create:\\n# adduser -c \"Asterisk PBX\" asterisk\\n# passwd asterisk\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve created the asterisk user, let\\'s switch to that user, with which we\\'ll\\nperform the rest of the commands. Once we su to the asterisk user, we can download\\na copy of Asterisk via SVN, FTP or WGET, and then compile and install. We\\'re going\\nto grab a copy of Asterisk from the SVN repository in the following example.\\n1.4.5 is the current release version at the time of this writing, but it won\\'t\\nbe by the time you read this, so check the Asterisk web site for the latest\\nversion. In other words, don\\'t just type 1.4.5 whenever you see us refer\\nto it. Find out what is current and use that instead.\\nsu - asterisk\\n./configure --prefix=$HOME/asterisk-bin --sysconfdir=$HOME/asterisk-bin\\n--localstatedir=$HOME/asterisk-bin\\n$ make menuselect\\n$ make install\\n#\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n\\nWhen running the ./configure script with the --prefix flag, we\\'re telling the system to\\ninstall the binary components into our $HOME directory under the subdirectory called\\nasterisk-bin. The --sysconfdir flag tells the system where to place the configuration\\nfiles, and --localstatedir tells the system where to install additional files, such as\\nsounds. The key here is that since we are downloading, compiling, and installing as the\\nuser asterisk, everything that only gets created will be assigned to that user, and have\\nthe permissions granted to that user.\\nWe can now install the sample files as well into the $HOME/asterisk-bin/asterisk\\ndirectory:\\n$ make samples\\n\\nTest starting up Asterisk with the following command:\\n$ ./asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk -cvvv\\n\\nNormally, Asterisk needs to be run as a service. During installation, the make config\\ncommand will install the init scripts. Unfortunately, this will not work when you are\\nlogged in as the user asterisk, because only the root user has the authority to make\\n\\n su historically means super-user, but nowadays it could also mean switch-user or substitute-user. The - in\\n\\nthe command tells su to use the environment for that user (for example to use the PATH for that user)\\n $HOME is a system variable that defines the path to the home directory for the current user, i.e., /home/asterisk.\\n\\n296 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cchanges to system startup commands. It would appear that what we need to do is log\\nin as root, navigate to the /home/asterisk/asterisk-1.4.5 folder, and run the\\nmake config command again (now with the authority to really make it happen). Problem\\nsolved, right?\\nYes, but not quite. If you run the service asterisk start command, you will find that\\nit complains that it cannot find asterisk. Know why? Because the init script figures the\\nasterisk executable got installed in /usr/sbin, where it would be if we had installed\\nasterisk as root. So, we need to tell the init script where to find asterisk and the\\nsafe_asterisk script, like this:\\n# ln -s /home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk /usr/sbin/asterisk\\n# ln -s /home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/safe_asterisk /usr/sbin/safe_asterisk\\n\\nSince the init script utilizes the safe_asterisk script, and by default wants to start Asterisk\\nas the root user, we have to modify the safe_asterisk script telling it to run Asterisk as\\nour non-root user. So open up the safe_asterisk script with your favorite text editor and\\nlook for the ASTARGS variable (around line 78). Then add -U asterisk between the quotes\\nlike so:\\n#\\n# Don\\'t fork when running \"safely\"\\n#\\nASTARGS=\"-U asterisk\"\\n\\nGo ahead and start Asterisk by running service asterisk start and verify Asterisk is\\nrunning as the asterisk user using the ps command:\\n# service asterisk start\\n# ps aux | grep asterisk\\nSl\\n/home/asterisk/asterisk-bin/sbin/asterisk -U asterisk -vvvg -c\\n\\nThe 503 is actually our asterisk user, which we verify by looking at the /etc/passwd file:\\n# cat /etc/passwd\\n\\nReboot the system to ensure that everything comes up as required. Keep in mind that\\na lot of things that you do with Asterisk might assume that you are running as root, so\\nkeep an eye out for errors that relate to a lack of permission. Your Asterisk process may\\nthink it is the superuser, but we have clipped its wings somewhat.\\nWhy go through the trouble? The advantage of this is simply that if any security vulnerability in Asterisk allows someone to access the box through the Asterisk account,\\n\\n If you walk up to any system that\\'s running Asterisk, hook a keyboard and screen up to it, and press Alt-F9;\\n\\nyou will be connected to the Asterisk CLI. Press ! and hit Return, and you will have a shell. If Asterisk is\\nrunning as root, you now own that system.\\n\\nRunning Asterisk As a Non-root User | 297\\n\\x0che will be limited to system activities allowed by that account. When Asterisk is run as\\nroot, a security compromise gives the intruder full control of your system.\\n\\nCustomizing System Prompts\\nIn keeping with the seemingly limitless flexibility of Asterisk, you can also modify the\\nsystem prompts. This is very simple to explain, but generally difficult to do well.\\nWith more than 300 system prompts in the main distribution, and an additional 600\\nin the asterisk-sounds add-on, if you\\'re contemplating customizing all of them you\\'d\\nbetter have either a lot of money or a lot of time on your hands.\\nAn audio engineer is also recommended to ensure that the recordings are normalized\\nto 3 dB and that all prompts start and end at a zero-crossing point (with just the right\\namount of silence prepended and appended).\\n\\nThe Voice\\nIf you are interested in The Voice of Asterisk, she is Allison Smith, and she can deliver\\ncustomized recordings for you to use on your own system.\\nThis is a powerful concept, as very few PBXes allow you to use the same voice in your\\ncustom recordings as is used by the system prompts.\\nAllison is the voice of the system prompts in both English and Spanish.\\nThere are also prompts available in French. Montreal\\'s own June Wallack is the voice\\nof the French Asterisk prompts (and also does prompts in flawless English,# should\\nyou want the same voice for both languages).\\nTo find out how to get your own voice prompts, visit the Digium web site, http://\\nwww.digium.com/products/voice.\\n\\nOnce you have the recordings, the actual implementation is easy--simply replace the\\nfiles in /var/lib/asterisk/sounds with the ones you have created.\\nAlternatively, you can opt to record your own prompts and place them in a folder of\\nyour choosing. When you refer to sound files with the Playback() or Background()\\napplications, you can refer to the full pathname of the sound file, or to any subdirectory\\nof /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/.\\nNote that the default sounds that come with Asterisk are delivered in format. We would\\nnot normally recommend storing them in this format (unless you have a lot of channels\\n# We were going to say \"accentless English\", but then we\\'d have to apologize to folks from the British Isles,\\n\\nAustralia, South Africa, and who knows where else. We are not experts in languages, dialects, and such, but our\\nears tell us that there is a type of accent that in North America is common for professional voices. This is the\\naccent that is common to the Pacific coast from San Diego to Seattle, and most of English-speaking Canada as\\nwell. Both June and Allison deliver English prompts in this accent, and we think it sounds great.\\n\\n298 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0cthat will be entering the system using the GSM codec). Sure, you save some hard drive\\nspace, but the extra load on your CPU when it has to transcode all these files (not to\\nmention the lower overall quality of the sound) makes the use of GSM undesirable, to\\nour thinking. Use uncompressed files (such as .wav, .ulaw or .alaw) and your CPU will\\nnot have to work as hard. As an added bonus, your prompts will sound better.\\n\\nSound Recording from the Dialplan\\nSurprisingly, one of the easiest ways to get respectable-quality recordings is not through\\na PC with fancy editing software, but rather through a telephone set. There are many\\nreasons for this, but the most important is that the telephone will tend to filter out\\nbackground noise (such as white noise caused by HVAC equipment) and will record\\nat a consistent audio level.\\nThis little addition to your dialplan will allow you to easily create recordings, which\\nwill be placed in your system\\'s /tmp/ folder (from there, you can rename them and move\\nthem wherever you\\'d like):\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\n\\nThis snippet will allow you to dial from 6600 to 6699, and it will record prompts in\\nthe /tmp/ folder using the names prompt00.wav to prompt99.wav. After you complete\\nrecording (by pressing the # key), it will play your prompt back to you and hang up.\\nBe sure to move your prompts out of the /tmp/ dir to the Asterisk sounds directory. To\\nkeep the dialplan readable, rename your prompt<XX> files to something more meaningful. For example:\\nmv /tmp/prompt00.wav /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/welcome-message.wav\\n\\nMusic on Hold\\nAny popular PBX system offers the ability to supply a source of music to be played for\\ncallers while on hold. Asterisk allows for a lot of creativity in this regard.\\nNowadays, everyone is familiar with the MP3 music format, and there is a lot of interest\\nin using MP3s as a music-on-hold source. The concept sure seems like a good idea, but\\nthere are a few things that we think should be given some consideration:\\n\\nMusic on Hold | 299\\n\\x0c MP3 files are extremely complex, and require a substantial amount of CPU to\\ndecode. If you have a lot of channels pulling music from the system (for example,\\npeople sometimes like to listen to music through their phone, or a call center may\\nhave several callers on hold), the load on the CPU caused by all of the transcoding\\nof the stored MP3 files could place too much demand on a machine that is otherwise\\nsuitable to the performance needs of the system.\\n Current-generation hard drives hold a lot of data, so there may not be any reason\\nto worry about cutting down hard drive use. Compressed audio makes sense from\\na distribution standpoint (an MP3 is a much smaller download than the equivalent\\nin .wav format), but once on your system, do we really care how much space they\\ntake up?\\n MP3 files don\\'t usually come with the right sort of licensing. ;-)\\nTaking all of this into consideration, we recommend that you convert your music sources into the native format of the various codecs you may be supporting. For example,\\nif you support law for your internal phones, and G.729 on your VoIP circuits, you will\\nwant to store your music in both formats so that Asterisk will not have to perform\\ntranscoding to play music to calls on those channels.\\n\\nFree Music\\nA lot of people do not realize that playing music on hold requires a special license. This\\nis true even if you play music from CDs that you own, or from the radio. To ensure that\\nthere is no ambiguity, we recommend avoiding the whole matter and using only music\\nthat does not come encumbered with the kind of licenses that the music industry seems\\nto prefer.\\nThere are many web sites where you can go to get music that is licensed in a manner\\nthat is suitable for music on hold. Two that we have found are http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Wikipedia:Sound/list and http://www.opsound.org/.\\nBoth offer a sizeable collection of music that can be easily downloaded. Note that this\\nmay not all be of professional quality, so listen to all of it before you commit it to your\\nmusic-on-hold collection.*\\n\\nWe often use public domain music (or Creative Commons licensed music) on our\\nsystems. Creative Commons music often comes in ogg-Vorbis format (which is conceptually similar to MP3, but not compatible). In order to play .ogg or .mp3 files on our\\nAsterisk system, we are going to convert them to a format that Asterisk can easily\\nhandle. This requires the following steps:\\n1. We need to make sure that SoX, the Sound eXchange utility, is installed. If not,\\nrun the following command to install it:\\n* Seed a search with the term \"Creative Commons music\" to find more freely usable music.\\n\\n300 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0c$ yum install sox\\n\\n2. Download the music that you have chosen to a working folder on your system\\n(/tmp is probably a suitable location). As an example, the following command\\ndownloaded some nice piano music by Pachelbel for us:\\n$ wget http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Pachelbel%27s_Canon.ogg\\n\\n3. Now we have to convert the song from ogg-Vorbis format to a format more suitable\\nto Asterisk:\\n$ sox Pachelbel\\\\\\'s_Canon.ogg -r 8000 -c 1 -s -w moh1.wav resample -ql\\n\\nYou may also need to adjust the amplitude with the -v option.\\n\\nWe\\'ve now taken our source file, converted it to a .wav file suitable to Asterisk,\\nand saved the resulting file as moh1.wav.\\n4. Almost done now. We just need to create a folder for the permanent home of the\\nnew files (/tmp is certainly no place for them):\\n$ mkdir /var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\n\\nand then move them there:\\n$ mv *.wav /var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\n\\n5. Since we have placed our music files in a different folder from that where Asterisk\\ninstalls its sample music, we will need to change the configuration file to reflect\\nthis. Edit your /etc/asterisk/musiconhold.conf file with one that contains the\\nfollowing:\\n[default]\\nmode=files\\ndirectory=/var/lib/asterisk/mohwav\\nrandom=yes\\n\\nAs for what to play, that will depend on what image you want to project to your callers.\\nRegardless of your choice, you should keep some things in mind:\\n People don\\'t actually want to be on hold, so they are not usually planning to be\\nthere for long. This means that there is not much point in providing them with a\\nmind-expanding musical experience. If things go as they hope, they won\\'t be there\\nlong enough to get into it.\\n\\n Note that we could have used any format that was compatible with Asterisk; we\\'ve just chosen .wav for this\\n\\nexample because it is easy for the CPU to transcode into law/alaw/slin on the fly, yet remains easy to work\\nwith in other environments.\\n\\nMusic on Hold | 301\\n\\x0c The fidelity on a phone system does not allow for accurate reproduction of tones.\\nHeavy bass generally sounds terrible, and high frequencies will typically just end\\nup as noise. Keep the music simple, and it is more likely to sound good.\\n Musical tastes are as varied as people, and while it might be nice to try and cover\\na wide range of styles, music that is too eclectic is more likely to annoy than enlighten.\\nClassical music addresses all of the above criteria, and it is easy to obtain. It also sounds\\nclassy (go figure!), so it is a pretty safe choice, although we\\'ll admit it doesn\\'t usually\\nscore any points in the hipness department.\\nAsterisk includes three songs with the source code download that are licensed for use\\nwith Asterisk. These songs are intended as samples. Since there are only three of them,\\npeople who call you regularly will quickly tire of them. We have a recurring nightmare\\nin which the worldwide success of Asterisk means that the human race is forced to\\nlisten to the same three songs as music on hold. That is why we wrote this section for\\nyou.\\n\\nRandomizing Music on Hold\\nIn a traditional PBX, music on hold usually comes from a single source. Everyone that\\nis hearing music is hearing the exact same thing at the exact same time, and even when\\nno one is on hold, the music is still playing. On Asterisk, the music is not playing until\\na need for it arises, and each caller gets her own music source. If Asterisk were to simply\\nstart playing songs in the order it found them, each call placed on hold would always\\nhear the same song starting from the beginning. In order to simulate traditional music\\non hold, Asterisk can (and normally should) be set to play the music in a random\\nfashion. This means that it will select which file to play at random. If you have enough\\ndifferent songs in your music-on-hold directory, you will minimize the chance that\\nsomeone who calls frequently will have to listen to the same songs all of the time.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis chapter could easily become a book (and possibly will one day). We have chosen\\na few topics to cover that we think will provide value to most readers, but there are\\ncertainly many more topics that can be discussed. As with so many things in this book,\\nwe have merely scratched the surface.\\n\\n302 | Chapter 13: Managing Your Asterisk System\\n\\x0c\\nPotpourri\\n\\nThe first 90 percent of the task takes 90 percent of the\\ntime, and the last 10 percent of the task takes the other\\n90 percent of the time.\\n--The Ninety:Ten Rule\\n\\nThe toughest part of writing this book was not finding things to write about, but rather\\ndeciding what we would not be able to write about. Now that we\\'ve covered the basics,\\nyou are ready to be told the truth: we have not taught you anywhere near all that there\\nis to know about Asterisk.\\nNow please understand, this is not because we didn\\'t want to give you our very best;\\nit\\'s merely because Asterisk is, well, limitless (or so we believe).\\nIn this chapter, we want to give you a taste of some of the wonders Asterisk holds in\\nstore for you. Nearly every section in this chapter could become a book in itself (and\\nthey will become books, if Asterisk succeeds in the way we think it is going to).\\n\\nFestival\\nFestival is a popular open source text-to-speech engine. The basic premise of using\\nFestival with Asterisk is that your dialplan can pass a body of text to Festival, which\\nwill then \"speak\" the text to the caller. Probably the most obvious use for Festival would\\nbe to have it read your email to you when you are on the road.*\\n\\n* Probably the coolest use of Festival is in Simon Ditner\\'s ZoIP, a port of the famous Zork game to a fully\\n\\nspeech-enabled engine running on Asterisk (ZoIP also uses Sphinx, which we will not be covering in this\\nbook). We\\'re going to have to come up with a new kind of name for this sort of thing. It\\'s not a video game,\\nsince there is no screen, so do we need to call these audio games? Regardless, check it out at http://\\nwww.zoip.org.\\n\\n\\x0cGetting Festival Set Up and Ready for Asterisk\\nThere are currently two ways to use Festival with Asterisk. The first (and easiest) method--without having to patch and recompile Festival--is to add the following text to\\nFestival\\'s configuration file (festival.scm, usually located in /etc/ or /usr/share/festival/):\\n(define (tts_textasterisk string mode)\\n\"(tts_textasterisk STRING MODE)\\nApply tts to STRING. This function is specifically designed for use in\\nserver mode so a single function call may synthesize the string. This\\nfunction name may be added to the server safe functions.\"\\n(let ((wholeutt (utt.synth (eval (list \\'Utterance \\'Text string)))))\\n(utt.wave.resample wholeutt 8000)\\n(utt.wave.rescale wholeutt 5)\\n(utt.send.wave.client wholeutt)))\\n\\nYou may place this text anywhere in the file, as long as it is not between any other\\nparentheses.\\nThe second (and more traditional) way is to compile Festival with an Asterisk-specific\\npatch (located in the contrib/ directory of the Asterisk source).\\nInformation on both of these methods is contained in the README.festival file, located\\nin the contrib/ directory of the Asterisk source.\\nFor either method, you\\'ll need to modify the Festival access list in the festival.scm file.\\nSimply search for the word \"localhost\" and replace it with the fully qualified domain\\nname of your server.\\nBoth of these methods set up Festival to be able to correctly communicate with Asterisk.\\nAfter setting up Festival, you should start the Festival server. You can then call the\\nFestival() application from within your dialplan.\\n\\nConfiguring Asterisk for Festival\\nThe Asterisk configuration file that deals with Festival is aptly called festival.conf. Inside\\nthis file, you specify the hostname and port of your Festival server, as well some settings\\nfor the caching of Festival speech. For most installations (if you\\'re going to run Festival\\non your Asterisk server), the defaults will work just fine.\\n\\nStarting the Festival Server\\nTo start the Festival server for debugging purposes, simply run festival with the\\n--server argument, like this:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival --server\\n\\n304 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cOnce you\\'re sure that the Festival server is running and not rejecting your connections,\\nyou can start Festival by typing:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival_server 2>&1 >/dev/null &\\n\\nCalling Festival from the Dialplan\\nNow that Festival is configured and the Festival server is started, let\\'s call it from within\\na simple dialplan:\\nexten => 123,1,Answer()\\nexten => 123,2,Festival(Asterisk and Festival are working together)\\n\\nYou should always call the Answer() application before calling\\nFestival(), to ensure that a channel is established.\\n\\nAs Asterisk connects to Festival, you should see output like this in the terminal where\\nyou started the Festival server:\\n[root@asterisk ~]#\\nserver\\nSun May\\nclient(1) Sun May\\nclient(1) Sun May\\n\\nfestival --server\\n1 18:38:51 2005 : Festival server started on port 1314\\n\\nIf you see output like the following, it means you didn\\'t add the host to the access list\\nin festival.scm:\\n[root@asterisk ~]# festival --server\\nserver\\nSun May 1 18:30:52 2005 : Festival server started on port 1314\\nclient(1) Sun May 1 18:32:32 2005 : rejected from asterisk.localdomain not\\nin access list\\n\\nYet Another Way to Use Festival with Asterisk\\nSome people in the Asterisk community have reported success with passing text to\\nFestival\\'s text2wave utility and then having Asterisk play back the resulting .wav file.\\nFor example, you might do something like this:\\nexten => 124,1,Answer()\\nexten => 124,2,System(echo \"This is a test of Festival\" | /usr/bin/text2wave\\n-scale 1.5 -F 8000 -o /tmp/festival.wav)\\nexten => 124,3,Playback(/tmp/festival)\\nexten => 124,4,System(rm /tmp/festival.wav)\\nexten => 124,5,Hangup()\\n\\nThis method also allows you to call other text-to-speech engines, such as the popular\\nspeech engine from Cepstral http://www.cepstral.com, which is an inexpensive commercial derivative of Festival with very good-sounding voices. For this example, we\\'ll\\nassume that Cepstral is installed in /usr/local/cepstral/:\\nexten => 125,1,Answer()\\nexten => 125,2,System(/usr/local/cepstral/bin/swift -o /tmp/swift.wav\\n\\nFestival | 305\\n\\x0c\"This\\nexten\\nexten\\nexten\\n\\nis\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\na test of Cepstral\")\\n\\nCall Files\\nCall files allow you to create calls through the Linux shell. These powerful events are\\ntriggered by depositing a .call file in the directory /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing/. The\\nactual name of the file does not matter, but it\\'s good form to give the file a meaningful\\nname and to end the filename with .call.\\nWhen a call file appears in the outgoing folder, Asterisk will almost immediatelyact on\\nthe instructions contained therein.\\nCall files are formatted in the following manner. First, we define where we want to call:\\nChannel: channel\\n\\nWe can control how long to wait for a call to be answered (the default is 45 seconds),\\nhow long to wait between call retries, and the maximum number of retries. If\\nMaxRetries is omitted, the call will be attempted only once:\\nWaitTime: number\\nRetryTime: number\\nMaxRetries: number\\n\\nIf the call is answered, we specify where to connect it here:\\nContext: context-name\\nExtension: ext\\nPriority: priority\\n\\nAlternatively, we can specify a single application and pass arguments to it:\\nApplication: Playback()\\nData: hello-world\\n\\nNext, we set the Caller ID of the outgoing call:\\nCallerID: Asterisk 800-555-1212\\n\\nThen we set channel variables, as follows:\\n\\nand add a CDR account code:\\nAccount: documentation\\n\\n We\\'re talking within milliseconds here. Don\\'t believe us? Try it for yourself!\\n\\n306 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cWhen you create a call file, do not do so from the spool directory. Asterisk monitors the spool aggressively and will try to grab your file before\\nyou\\'ve even finished writing it! Create call files in some other folder,\\nmake a copy in the same folder, and then mv the copy into the spool\\ndirectory. Note that we said mv, not cp. This is important, because the\\nway that Linux copies files means that the file appears in the destination\\nfolder before it is completely there. Contrast that with a mv operation,\\nwhich will not allow the file to appear in the destination folder until the\\nmove operation is complete. If you copy, there is a very good chance\\nthat Asterisk will read the file before it is all there, which will cause\\nunexpected results.\\n\\nDUNDi\\nIf there were any concerns that Mark Spencer was in danger of running out of good\\nideas, Distributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) ought to lay such thoughts\\nto rest. DUNDi is poised to be as revolutionary as Asterisk. The DUNDi web site (http://\\nwww.dundi.com) says it best: \"DUNDiTM is a peer to peer system for locating Internet\\ngateways to telephony services. Unlike traditional centralized services (such as the remarkably simple and concise ENUM standard; http://www.faqs.org/rfc/rfc2916.txt),\\nDUNDi is fully distributed with no centralized authority whatsoever.\" DUNDi is\\nsomewhat of a routing protocol for VoIP.\\n\\nHow Does DUNDi Work?\\nThink of DUNDi as a large phone book that allows you to ask peers if they know of an\\nalternative VoIP route to an extension number or PSTN telephone number.\\nFor example, assume that you are connected to the DUNDi-test network (a free and\\nopen network that terminates calls to traditional PSTN numbers). You ask your friend\\nBob if he knows how to reach 1-212-555-1212, a number for which you have no direct\\naccess. Bob replies, \"I don\\'t know how to reach that number, but let me ask my peer\\nSally.\"\\nBob asks Sally if she knows how to reach the requested number, and she responds with,\\n\"You can reach that number at IAX2/dundi:very_long_password@hostname/extension.\"\\nBob then stores the address in his database and passes on to you the information about\\nhow to reach 1-800-555-1212 via VoIP, allowing you an alternative method of reaching\\nthe same destination through a different network.\\nBecause Bob has stored the information he found, he\\'ll be able to provide it to any peers\\nwho later request the same number from him, so the lookup won\\'t have to go any\\nfurther. This helps reduce the load on the network and increases response times for\\nnumbers that are looked up often. (However, it should be noted that DUNDi creates\\na rotating key and, thus, stored information is valid for a limited period of time.)\\n\\nDUNDi | 307\\n\\x0cDUNDi performs lookups dynamically, either with a switch => statement in your\\nextensions.conf file or with the use of the DUNDiLookup() application. DUNDi is available\\nonly in Asterisk version 1.2 or higher.\\nYou can use the DUNDi protocol in a private network as well. Say you\\'re the Asterisk\\nadministrator of a very large enterprise installation, and you wish to simplify the administration of extension numbers. You could use DUNDi in this situation, allowing\\nmultiple Asterisk boxes (presumably located at each of the company\\'s locations and\\npeered with one another) to perform dynamic lookups for the VoIP addresses of extensions on the network.\\n\\nConfiguring Asterisk for Use with DUNDi\\nThere are three files that need to be configured for DUNDi: dundi.conf,\\nextensions.conf, and iax.conf. The dundi.conf file controls the authentication of peers\\nwhom we allow to perform lookups through our system. This file also manages the list\\nof peers to whom we might submit our own lookup requests. Since it is possible to run\\nseveral different networks on the same box, it is necessary to define a different section\\nfor each peer, and then configure the networks in which that peer is allowed to perform\\nlookups. Additionally, we need to define which peers we wish to use to perform\\nlookups.\\n\\nThe General Peering Agreement\\nThe General Peering Agreement (GPA) is a legally binding license agreement that is\\ndesigned to prevent abuse of the DUNDi protocol. Before connecting to the\\nDUNDi-test group, you are required to sign a GPA. The GPA is used to protect the\\nmembers of the group and to create a \"trust\" between the members. It is a requirement\\nof the DUNDi-test group that your complete and accurate contact information be configured in dundi.conf, so that members of your peer group can contact you. The GPA\\ncan be found in the doc/ subdirectory of the Asterisk source.\\n\\nGeneral configuration\\nThe [general] section of dundi.conf contains parameters relating to the overall operation of the DUNDi client and server:\\n; DUNDi configuration file\\n;\\n[general]\\n;\\ndepartment=IT\\norganization= toronto.example.com\\n\\n The dundi.conf and extensions.conf files must be configured. We have chosen to configure iax.conf for our\\n\\naddress advertisement on the network, but DUNDi is protocol-agnostic--thus sip.conf, h323.conf, or\\nmgcp.conf could be used instead.\\n\\n308 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0clocality=Toronto\\nstateprov=ON\\ncountry=CA\\nemail=support@toronto.example.com\\n;\\n; Specify bind address and port number.\\nentityid=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\\nautokill=yes\\n;secretpath=dundi\\n\\nDefault is 4520\\n\\nThe entity identifier defined by entityid should generally be the Media Access Control\\n(MAC) address of an interface in the machine. The entity ID defaults to the first Ethernet\\naddress of the server, but you can override this with entityid, as long as it is set to the\\nMAC address of something you own. The MAC address of the primary external interface\\nis recommended. This is the address that other peers will use to identify you.\\nThe Time To Live (ttl) field defines how many peers away we wish to receive replies\\nfrom and is used to break loops. Each time a request is passed on down the line because\\nthe requested number is not known, the value in the TTL field is decreased by one,\\nmuch like the TTL field of an ICMP packet. The TTL field also defines the maximum\\nnumber of seconds we are willing to wait for a reply.\\nWhen you request a number lookup, an initial query (called a DPDISCOVER) is sent to\\nyour peers requesting that number. If you do not receive an acknowledgment (ACK) of\\nyour query (DPDISCOVER) within 2,000 ms (enough time for a single transmission only)\\nand autokill is equal to yes, Asterisk will send a CANCEL to the peers. (Note that an\\nacknowledgment is not necessarily a reply to the query; it is just an acknowledgment\\nthat the peer has received the request.) The purpose of autokill is to keep the lookup\\nfrom stalling due to hosts with high latency. In addition to the yes and no options, you\\nmay also specify the number of milliseconds to wait.\\nThe pbx_dundi module creates a rotating key and stores it in the local Asterisk database\\n(AstDB). The key name secret is stored in the dundi family. The value of the key can\\nbe viewed with the database show command at the Asterisk console. The database\\nfamily can be overridden with the secretpath option.\\n\\nCreating mapping contexts\\nThe dundi.conf file defines DUNDi contexts that are mapped to dialplan contexts in\\nyour extensions.conf file. DUNDi contexts are a way of defining distinct and separate\\ndirectory service groups. The contexts in the mapping section point to contexts in the\\nextensions.conf file, which control the numbers that you advertise. When you create a\\npeer, you need to define which mapping contexts you will allow this peer to search.\\nYou do this with the permit statement (each peer may contain multiple permit\\n\\nDUNDi | 309\\n\\x0cstatements). Mapping contexts are related to dialplan contexts in the sense that they\\nare a security boundary for your peers.\\nPhone numbers must be advertised in the following format:\\n<country_code><area_code><prefix><number>\\n\\nFor example, a complete North American number could be advertised as 14165551212.\\nAll DUNDi mapping contexts take the form of:\\ndundi_context => local_context,weight,technology,destination[,options]]\\n\\nThe following configuration creates a DUNDi mapping context that we will use to\\nadvertise our local phone numbers to the DUNDi-test group. Note that this should all\\nappear on one line:\\ndundi-test => dundi-local,0,IAX2,dundi:${SECRET}@toronto.example.com/\\n${NUMBER}, nounsolicited,nocomunsolicit,nopartial\\n\\nIn this example, the mapping context is dundi-test, which points to the dundi-local\\ncontext within extensions.conf (providing a listing of phone numbers to reply to).\\nNumbers that resolve to the PBX should be advertised with a weight of zero (directly\\nconnected). Numbers higher than 0 indicate an increased number of hops or paths to\\nreach the final destination. This is useful when multiple replies for the same lookup are\\nreceived at the end that initially requested the number; a weight with a lower number\\nwill be the preferred path.\\nIf we can reply to a lookup, our response will contain the method by which the other\\nend can connect to the system. This includes the technology to use (such as IAX2, SIP,\\nH323, and so on), the username and password with which to authenticate, which host\\nto send the authentication to, and finally the extension number.\\nAsterisk provides some shortcuts to allow us to create a \"template\" with which we can\\nbuild our responses. The following channel variables can be used to construct the template:\\n${SECRET}\\n\\nReplaced with the password stored in the local AstDB\\n${NUMBER}\\n\\nThe number being requested\\n${IPADDR}\\n\\nThe IP address to connect to\\nIt is generally safest to statically configure the hostname, rather than\\nmaking use of the ${IPADDR} variable. The ${IPADDR} variable will sometimes reply with an address in the private IP space, which is unreachable\\nfrom the Internet.\\n\\n310 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cDefining DUNDi peers\\nDUNDi peers are defined in the dundi.conf file. Peers are identified by the unique layertwo MAC address of an interface on the remote system. The dundi.conf file is where\\nwe define what context to search for peers requesting a lookup and which peers we\\nwant to use when doing a lookup for a particular network:\\n[00:00:00:00:00:00] ; Remote Office\\nmodel = symmetric\\nhost = montreal.example.com\\ninkey = montreal\\noutkey = toronto\\ninclude = dundi-test\\npermit = dundi-test\\nqualify = yes\\ndynamic=yes\\n\\nThe remote peer\\'s identifier (MAC address) is enclosed in square brackets ([]). The\\ninkey and outkey are the public/private key pairs that we use for authentication. Key\\npairs are generated with the astgenkey script, located in the ./asterisk/contrib/scripts/\\nsource directory. Be sure to use the -n flag so that you don\\'t have to initialize passwords\\nevery time you start Asterisk:\\n# cd /var/lib/asterisk/keys\\n# /usr/src/asterisk/contrib/scripts/astgenkey -n toronto\\n\\nThe resulting keys, toronto.pub and toronto.key, will be placed in your /var/lib/asterisk/\\nkeys/ directory. The toronto.pub file is the public key, which you should post to a web\\nserver so that it is easily accessible for anyone with whom you wish to peer. When you\\npeer, you can give your peers the HTTP-accessible public key, which they can then\\nplace in their /var/lib/asterisk/keys/ directories.\\nAfter you have downloaded the keys, you must reload the res_crypto.so and pbx_dun\\ndi.so modules in Asterisk:\\n*CLI> module reload res_crypto.so\\n-- Reloading module \\'res_crypto.so\\' (Cryptographic Digital Signatures)\\n-- Loaded PRIVATE key \\'toronto\\'\\n-- Loaded PUBLIC key \\'toronto\\'\\n*CLI> module reload pbx_dundi.so\\n-- Reloading module \\'pbx_dundi.so\\' (Distributed Universal Number\\nDiscovery\\n(DUNDi))\\n== Parsing \\'/etc/asterisk/dundi.conf\\': Found\\n\\nThen, create the dundi user in the iax.conf file to allow connections into your Asterisk\\nsystem. When a call is authenticated, the extension number being requested is passed\\nto the dundi-local context in the extensions.conf file, where the call is then handled by\\nAsterisk.\\n\\nDUNDi | 311\\n\\x0cAllowing remote connections\\nHere is the user definition for the dundi user:\\n[dundi]\\ntype=user\\ndbsecret=dundi/secret\\ncontext=dundi-local\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\n\\nInstead of using a static password, Asterisk regenerates passwords every 3,600 seconds\\n(1 hour). The value is stored in /dundi/secret of the Asterisk database and advertised\\nusing the ${SECRET} variable defined within the mapping context lines in dundi.conf.\\nYou can see the current keys for all peers, including your local public and private keys,\\nby performing a show keys at the Asterisk CLI.\\nThe context entry dundi-local is where authorized callers are sent in extensions.conf.\\nFrom there, we can manipulate the call just as we would in the dialplan of any other\\nincoming connection.\\n\\nConfiguring the dialplan\\nThe extensions.conf file handles what numbers you advertise and what you do with the\\ncalls that connect to them. The dundi-local context performs double duty:\\n It controls the numbers we advertise, referenced by the dundi mapping context in\\ndundi.conf.\\n It controls what to do with the call, referenced by the dundi user in iax.conf.\\nYou have the power of dialplan pattern matching to advertise ranges of numbers and\\nto control the incoming calls. In the following dialplan, we are only advertising the\\nnumber +1-416-555-1212, but pattern matching could just as easily have been employed to advertise a range of numbers or extensions:\\n[dundi-local]\\nexten => 14165551212,1,NoOp(dundi-local: Number advertisement and incoming)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Answer()\\nexten => 14165551212,n(call),Dial(SIP/1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Voicemail(u1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\nexten => 14165551212,n(call)+101,Voicemail(b1000)\\nexten => 14165551212,n,Hangup()\\n\\nAlternative Voicemail Storage Methods\\nAsterisk\\'s normal way of storing voicemail is to simply record the message in a file,\\nwhich is placed on the local hard drive under the /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail tree.\\nWhile this works well enough for simple PBX deployments, there are more advanced\\n\\n312 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cways of doing this that can be very useful in larger, distributed networks, or environments where tighter integration with external applications is desired.\\n\\nStoring Voicemail in an IMAP Server\\nThe ability to store voice messages in the same location as regular email is something\\nthat the telecom industry has been promising for a long time. They called it Unified\\nMessaging, and while most PBXes now offer some sort of unified messaging, it is typically very expensive to license and implement.\\nNaturally, Asterisk cuts through all the silliness and just allows you to have your voicemailbox integrated into an IMAP environment. There are several advantages to\\nstoring your voicemail on an IMAP server. When you listen to a voicemail on your\\nphone, the message is set to the read state on the IMAP server. This means that your\\nemail client will also note that it has been read. By the same token, if you listen to the\\nmessage from your email client, the voicemail will turn off the message notification\\nlight on any phones that are assigned to that mailbox. Deleting a message from one\\nplace will cause it to be deleted from every place. So once deleted, the message is truly\\ngone. This is Unified Messaging, the holy grail of voicemail to email integration, but\\nAsterisk humbly decides not to make a big deal of it.\\nIMAP integration is still new functionality, so there are a few things that need to be\\nadded in order to get it to function. First off, Asterisk needs to have an IMAP client\\ninstalled so that it can communicate with the IMAP server. Pretty much any IMAP\\nserver works (even Exchange Server), and the authors have personally tested IMAP\\nvoicemail support with both the Courier-IMAP and Dovecot IMAP servers. The IMAP\\nserver may be on the same physical machine as the Asterisk installation, or it may be\\non the other side of the globe. To be able to access the IMAP server, Asterisk requires\\nan IMAP client library. This library is the University of Washington\\'s free IMAP client,\\nnamed c-client. To install the c-client you simply need to navigate to your /usr/src directory and run the following commands:\\n# wget ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z\\n\\nThis downloads the source code. Extract it with:\\n# tar zxvf imap.tar.Z\\n\\nYou\\'ll want to pay special attention to the name of the directory that is\\ncreated by this command, as the directory name will probably change\\nagain by the time you read this. During the production of this book, the\\ndirectory name has changed four times. The last time we checked, it was\\nnamed /usr/src/imap-2006h.\\n\\nNavigate into the resulting folder and run:\\n# make lrh IP6=4\\n\\nAlternative Voicemail Storage Methods | 313\\n\\x0cThis will compile everything Asterisk needs to make use of the IMAP client libraries.\\nNow we have to recompile Asterisk with the IMAP capabilities. We\\'ll need to navigate\\nto the location of our Asterisk source files (such as /usr/src/asterisk), and run the following command:\\n# /configure --with-imap=/usr/src/imap-2006h\\n\\nThe we need to rerun make menuconfig to incorporate IMAP storage into the compile.\\nUnder Voicemail Build Options select the IMAP_STORAGE parameter, and then press x to\\nsave and exit. This ensures that when we compile Asterisk, it will build the IMAP\\nmodule as well. Obviously, the next step then is to recompile and reinstall Asterisk. A\\nsimple way to do this is, in your terminal, to run:\\n# make && make install\\n\\nOK, so we\\'ve got the module compiled and installed. Now it\\'s time to configure it.\\nIn the /etc/asterisk folder, we\\'ll need to add a few lines to the voicemail.conf file, in the\\n[general] section:\\nimapserver=localhost\\nexpungeonhangup=yes\\nauthuser=vmail\\nauthpassword=vmailsecret\\nimapfolder=Voicemail\\n\\nSince Dovecot is available in the CentOS package repository, installing a small IMAP\\nserver to handle your virtual (voicemail) users on your Asterisk box is simple:\\n# yum install dovecot\\n\\nNow make sure that IMAP support is enabled in /etc/dovecot.conf by uncommenting\\nthe protocols line so that it appears as follows:\\nprotocols = imap imaps\\n\\nAfter you\\'ve enabled IMAP support, create the user account that will be storing the\\nmail:\\n# groupadd vmail\\n# useradd vmail -g vmail -s /bin/true -c \"asterisk voicemail user\" -p vmailsecret\\n-d /var/spool/asterisk/imap-voicemail vmail\\n# chown -R vmail.vmail /var/spool/asterisk/imap-voicemail\\n\\nNow restart Dovecot and Asterisk, and you should be good to go.\\n# service dovecot restart\\n# service asterisk restart\\n\\n The lrh option tells the compiler that this is a Linux Red Hat system. The IP6=4 option tells the compiler\\n\\nthat we don\\'t want to compile in support for IPV6. Read the Makefile for other options. For RHEL 5 or\\nCentOS 5, you should use lr5 instead of lrh.\\n\\n314 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0cCongratulations! You\\'ve successfully installed basic IMAP voicemail support with Asterisk! This is just the tip of the iceberg, though. With IMAP voicemail storage, it is\\neasy to implement shared (e.g., departmental) voicemail using shared IMAP folders.\\nMany companies already have departmental email, so having a shared voicemail box\\nis a very natural and logical progression of the technology. With IMAP voicemail storage, each employee can manage several voicemail boxes without becoming confused\\nas to whether a particular voicemail message is for them personally or for a department\\nto which they belong. There is nothing unusual to configure from Asterisk\\'s point of\\nview; you simply call the VoiceMail() application with the desired mailbox and context,\\nand make sure that the department employees have the shared IMAP folder included\\nin their email client\\'s folder list.\\nFinally, you may want to use per-mailbox authorization (i.e., each voicemail box authenticates as a specific user) instead of a global Asterisk IMAP user. Asterisk supports\\nthis through the imapuser and imappassword options in the individual voicemail box\\ndefinition entries:\\n[imapvoicemail]\\n\\nIn this particular example, if a message is left in IMAP mailbox 100 in the\\nimapvoicemail context, Asterisk will authenticate to the IMAP server as sue@exam\\nple.tld, using suesimapsecret as the password. Similarly, bob@example.tld/bobsimap\\nsecret will be used to authenticate if a message is left in mailbox 101 of the same\\nvoicemail context.\\n\\nStoring Voicemail in an ODBC Database\\nIn case you missed it, you can also store voicemail in a database via the ODBC connector. See Chapter 12 for details!\\n\\nAsterisk and Jabber (XMPP)\\nThe name Jabber is actually the original name for the IETF XMPP protocols (RFC\\n3920-3923). Since Jabber is by far a better name than XMPP, the original name has\\nstuck. This protocol was originally designed to be a decentralized, nonproprietary,\\nopen-standards messaging and presence framework. It supports offline message delivery and encryption, and has grown to include voice messaging, which Asterisk supports.\\nIt is interesting to note that in the beginning, Jabber was seen as a competitor to the\\nSIMPLE protocol, which is SIP-based. XMPP is designed as a more general protocol,\\nand is of course XML-based.\\n\\nAsterisk and Jabber (XMPP) | 315\\n\\x0cAsterisk can be configured to utilize XMPP in several capacities. It may utilize XMPP\\nas a presence framework (e.g., Extension 205 is away or on the phone), or, through the\\nvoice messaging framework JINGLE, support full voice communications with other\\nservices such as Google Talk.\\nUnlike other messaging networks such as MSN and Yahoo!, XMPP is decentralized.\\nAnyone may have his own Jabber server and run any number of services on his server.\\nYou send messages in much the same way that you send email: the Jabber server you\\nuse contacts the Jabber server of the other person, and a direct connection is established. If the other person is not online, the message is stored, and when she log in to\\nher Jabber server, any stored messages are delivered. With encryption (the XMPP protocol supports TLS), it is no wonder why many businesses are starting to implement\\ntheir internal messaging networks using this amazing protocol, and Asterisk is able to\\nseamlessly integrate into this communications network.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThat\\'s pretty much all that this chapter is going to teach you, but it\\'s nowhere near all\\nthere is to learn. Hopefully, you are starting to get an idea of how big this Asterisk thing\\nreally is.\\nIn the next chapter, we\\'re going to try and predict the future of telecom, and we\\'ll\\ndiscuss how (and why) we believe that Asterisk is well positioned to play a starring role.\\n\\n316 | Chapter 14: Potpourri\\n\\x0c\\nAsterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\nFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they\\nfight you, then you win.\\n--Mahatma Gandhi\\n\\nWe have arrived at the final chapter of this book. We\\'ve covered a lot, but we hope\\nthat you now realize that we have barely begun to scratch the surface of this phenomenon called Asterisk. To wrap things up, we want to spend some time exploring what\\nwe might see from Asterisk and open source telephony in the near future.\\nWhile prognostication is always a thankless task, we are confident in asserting that\\nopen source communications engines such as Asterisk herald a shift in thinking that\\nwill transform the telecommunications industry. In this chapter, we will discuss some\\nof our reasons for this belief.\\n\\nThe Problems with Traditional Telephony\\nAlthough Alexander Graham Bell is most famously remembered as the father of the\\ntelephone, the reality is that during the latter half of the 1800s, dozens of minds were\\nworking toward the goal of carrying voice over telegraph lines. These people were\\nmostly business-minded folks, looking to create a product through which they might\\nmake their fortunes.\\nWe have come to think of traditional telephone companies as monopolies, but this was\\nnot true in their early days. The early history of telephone service took place in a very\\ncompetitive environment, with new companies springing up all over the world, often\\nwith little or no respect for the patents they might be violating. Many famous monopolies got their start through the waging (and winning) of patent wars.\\nIt\\'s interesting to contrast the history of the telephone with the history of Linux and\\nthe Internet. While the telephone was created as a commercial exercise, and the telecom\\nindustry was forged through lawsuits and corporate takeovers, Linux and the Internet\\narose out of the academic community, which has always valued the sharing of\\nknowledge over profit.\\n\\x0cThe cultural differences are obvious. Telecommunications technologies tend to be\\nclosed, confusing, and expensive, while networking technologies are generally open,\\nwell-documented, and competitive.\\n\\nClosed Thinking\\nIf one compares the culture of the telecommunications industry to that of the Internet,\\nit is sometimes difficult to believe the two are related. The Internet was designed by\\nenthusiasts, whereas contributing to the development of the PSTN is impossible for\\nany individual to contemplate. This is an exclusive club; membership is not open to\\njust anyone.*\\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) clearly exhibits this type of closed\\nthinking. If you want access to its knowledge, you have to be prepared to pay for it.\\nMembership requires proof of your qualifications, and you will be expected to pay\\nthousands of dollars to gain access to its library of publications.\\nAlthough the ITU is the United Nations\\'s sanctioned body responsible for international\\ntelecommunications, many of the VoIP protocols (SIP, MGCP, RTP, STUN) come not\\nfrom the hallowed halls of the ITU, but rather from the IETF (which publishes all of\\nits standards free to all, and allows anyone to submit an Internet Draft for\\nconsideration).\\nOpen protocols such as SIP may have a tactical advantage over ITU protocols, such as\\nH.323, due to the ease with which one can obtain them. Although H.323 is widely\\ndeployed by carriers as a VoIP protocol in the backbone, it is much more difficult to\\nfind H.323-based endpoints; newer products are far more likely to support SIP.\\nThe success of the IETF\\'s open approach has not gone unnoticed by the mighty ITU.\\nIt has recently become possible to download up to three documents free of charge from\\nthe ITU web site.Openness is clearly on its minds. Recent statements by the ITU suggest that there is a desire to achieve \"Greater participation in ITU by civil society and\\nthe academic world.\" Mr. Houlin Zhao, the ITU\\'s Director of the Telecommunication\\nStandardization Bureau (TSB), believes that \"ITU should take some steps to encourage\\nthis.\"\\nThe roadmap to achieving this openness is unclear, but the ITU is beginning to realize\\nthe inevitable.\\n\\n* Contrast this with the IETF\\'s membership page, which states: \"The IETF is not a membership organization\\n\\n(no cards, no dues, no secret handshakes :-)... It is open to any interested individual... Welcome to the IETF.\"\\nTalk about community!\\n Considering the thousands of documents available, and the fact that each document generally contains\\n\\nreferences to dozens more, the value of this free information is difficult to judge.\\n\\n318 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cAs for Asterisk, it embraces both the past and the future: H.323 support is available,\\nalthough the community has for the most part shunned H.323 in favor of the IETF\\nprotocol SIP and the darling of the Asterisk community, IAX.\\n\\nLimited Standards Compliancy\\nOne of the oddest things about all of the standards that exist in the world of legacy\\ntelecommunications is the various manufacturers\\' seeming inability to implement them\\nconsistently. Each manufacturer desires a total monopoly, so the concept of interoperability tends to take a back seat to being first to market with a creative new idea.\\nThe ISDN protocols are a classic example of this. Deployment of ISDN was (and in\\nmany ways still is) a painful and expensive proposition, as each manufacturer decided\\nto implement it in a slightly different way. ISDN could very well have helped to usher\\nin a massive public data network, 10 years before the Internet. Unfortunately, due to\\nits cost, complexity, and compatibility issues, ISDN never delivered much more than\\nvoice, with the occasional video or data connection for those willing to pay. ISDN is\\nquite common (especially in Europe, and in North America in larger PBX implementations), but it is not delivering anywhere near the capabilities that were envisioned for\\nit.\\nAs VoIP becomes more and more ubiquitous, the need for ISDN will disappear.\\n\\nSlow Release Cycles\\nIt can take months, or sometimes years, for the big guys to admit to a trend, let alone\\nrelease a product that is compatible with it. It seems that before a new technology can\\nbe embraced, it must be analyzed to death, and then it must pass successfully through\\nvarious layers of bureaucracy before it is even scheduled into the development cycle.\\nMonths or even years must pass before any useful product can be expected. When those\\nproducts are finally released, they are often based on hardware that is obsolete; they\\nalso tend to be expensive and to offer no more than a minimal feature set.\\nThese slow release cycles simply don\\'t work in today\\'s world of business communications. On the Internet, new ideas can take root in a matter of weeks and become viable\\nin extremely short periods of time. Since every other technology must adapt to these\\nchanges, so too must telecommunications.\\nOpen source development is inherently better able to adapt to rapid technological\\nchange, which gives it an enormous competitive advantage.\\nThe spectacular crash of the telecom industry may have been caused in large part by\\nan inability to change. Perhaps that continued inability is why recovery has been so\\nslow. Now, there is no choice: change, or cease to be. Community-driven technologies\\nsuch as Asterisk will see to that.\\n\\nThe Problems with Traditional Telephony | 319\\n\\x0cRefusing to Let Go of the Past and Embrace the Future\\nTraditional telecommunications companies have lost touch with their customers.\\nWhile the concept of adding functionality beyond the basic telephone is well understood, the idea that the user should be the one defining this functionality is not.\\nNowadays, people have nearly limitless flexibility in every other form of communication. They simply cannot understand why telecommunications cannot be delivered as\\nflexibly as the industry has been promising for so many years. The concept of flexibility\\nis not familiar to the telecom industry, and very well might not be until open source\\nproducts such as Asterisk begin to transform the fundamental nature of the industry.\\nThis is a revolution similar to the one Linux and the Internet willingly started more\\nthan 10 years ago (and IBM unwittingly started with the PC, 15 years before that). What\\nis this revolution? The commoditization of telephony hardware and software, enabling\\na proliferation of tailor-made telecommunications systems.\\n\\nParadigm Shift\\nIn \"Paradigm Shift\" (http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html), Tim\\nO\\'Reilly talks about a paradigm shift that is occurring in the way technology (both\\nhardware and software) is delivered. O\\'Reilly identifies three trends:\\nthe commoditization of software, network-enabled collaboration, and\\nsoftware customizability (software as a service). These three concepts provide evidence\\nto suggest that open source telephony is an idea whose time has come.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony\\nEvery good work of software starts by scratching a developer\\'s personal itch.\\n--Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar\\n\\nIn his book The Cathedral and the Bazaar (O\\'Reilly), Eric S. Raymond explains that\\n\"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\" The reason open source software development produces such consistent quality is simple: crap can\\'t hide.\\n\\nThe Itch That Asterisk Scratches\\nIn this era of custom database and web site development, people are not only tired of\\nhearing that their telephone system \"can\\'t do that,\" they quite frankly just don\\'t believe\\nit. The creative needs of the customers, coupled with the limitations of the technology,\\nhave spawned a type of creativity born of necessity: telecom engineers are like\\n Much of the following section is merely our interpretation of O\\'Reilly\\'s article. To get the full gist of these\\n\\nideas, the full read is highly recommended.\\n\\n320 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0ccontestants in an episode of Junkyard Wars, trying to create functional devices out of\\na pile of mismatched components.\\nThe development methodology of a proprietary telephone system dictates that it will\\nhave a huge number of features, and that the number of features will in large part\\ndetermine the price. Manufacturers will tell you that their products give you hundreds\\nof features, but if you only need five of them, who cares? Worse, if there\\'s one missing\\nfeature you really can\\'t do without, the value of that system will be diluted by the fact\\nthat it can\\'t completely address your needs.\\nThe fact that a customer might only need 5 out of 500 features is ignored, and that\\ncustomer\\'s desire to have 5 unavailable features that address the needs of his business\\nis dismissed as unreasonable. Until flexibility becomes standard, telecom will remain\\nstuck in the last century--all the VoIP in the world notwithstanding.\\nAsterisk addresses that problem directly and solves it in a way that few other telecom\\nsystems can. This is extremely disruptive technology, in large part because it is based\\non concepts that have been proven time and time again: \"the closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders\\nof magnitude more skilled time into a problem.\"#\\n\\nOpen Architecture\\nOne of the stumbling blocks of the traditional telecommunications industry has been\\nits apparent refusal to cooperate with itself. The big telecommunications giants have\\nall been around for over a hundred years. The concept of closed, proprietary systems\\nis so ingrained in their culture that even their attempts at standards compliancy are\\ntainted by their desire to get the jump on the competition, by adding that one feature\\nthat no one else supports. For an example of this thinking, one simply has to look at\\nthe VoIP products being offered by the telecom industry today. While they claim\\nstandards compliance, the thought that you would actually expect to be able to connect\\na Cisco phone to a Nortel switch, or that an Avaya voicemail system could be integrated\\nvia IP to a Siemens PBX, is not one that bears discussing.\\nIn the computer industry, things are different. Twenty years ago, if you bought an IBM\\nserver, you needed an IBM network and IBM terminals to talk to it. Now, that IBM\\nserver is likely to interconnect to Dell terminals though a Cisco network (and run Linux,\\nof all things). Anyone can easily think of thousands of variations on this theme. If any\\n\\n From the perspective of the closed-source industry, this attitude is understandable. In his book\\n\\nThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering (Addison-Wesley), Fred Brooks opined that \"the\\ncomplexity and communication costs of a project rise with the square of the number of developers, while\\nwork done only rises linearly.\" Without a community-based development methodology, it is very difficult to\\ndeliver products that at best are little more than incremental improvements over their predecessors, and at\\nworst are merely collections of patches.\\n# Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and the Bazaar.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony | 321\\n\\x0cone of these companies were to suggest that we could only use their products with\\nwhatever they told us, they would be laughed out of business.\\nThe telecommunications industry is facing the same changes, but it\\'s in no hurry to\\naccept them. Asterisk, on the other hand, is in a big hurry to not only accept change,\\nbut embrace it.\\nCisco, Nortel, Avaya, and Polycom IP phones (to name just a few) have all been successfully connected to Asterisk systems. There is no other PBX in the world today that\\ncan make this claim. None.\\nOpenness is the power of Asterisk.\\n\\nStandards Compliance\\nIn the past few years, it has become clear that standards evolve at such a rapid pace\\nthat to keep up with them requires an ability to quickly respond to emerging technology\\ntrends. Asterisk, by virtue of being an open source, community-driven development\\neffort, is uniquely suited to the kind of rapid development that standards compliance\\ndemands.\\nAsterisk does not focus on cost-benefit analysis or market research. It evolves in response to whatever the community finds exciting--or necessary.\\n\\nLightning-Fast Response to New Technologies\\nAfter Mark Spencer attended his first SIP Interoperability Test (SIPIT) event, he had a\\nrudimentary but working SIP stack for Asterisk coded within a few days. This was\\nbefore SIP had emerged as the protocol of choice in the VoIP world, but he saw its value\\nand momentum and ensured that Asterisk would be ready.\\nThis kind of foresight and flexibility is typical in an open source development community (and very unusual in a large corporation).\\n\\nPassionate Community\\nThe Asterisk-users list receives many email messages per day. More than 10,000 people\\nare subscribed to it. This kind of community support is unheard of in the world of\\nproprietary telecommunications, while in the open source world it is commonplace.\\nThe very first AstriCon event was expected to attract 100 participants. Nearly 500\\nshowed up (far more wanted to but couldn\\'t attend). This kind of community support\\nvirtually guarantees the success of an open source effort.\\n\\n322 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cInbound call to DID\\nPSTN\\n\\nPassed to PBX\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\nRelayed out to\\ncell phone\\n\\nLegacy PBX\\n\\nVoIP call\\n\\n\\nCell phone\\n\\nDelivered to\\nhome office\\n\\nPBX telephone\\nDatabase/Web/\\nApplication server\\n\\nVoIP\\nIP telephone\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\nRemote Asterisk\\n\\nDelivered to\\nremote PBX\\n\\nRemote PBX\\n\\nFigure 15-1. Asterisk as a PBX gateway\\n\\nSome Things That Are Now Possible\\nSo what sorts of things can be built using Asterisk? Let\\'s look at some of the things\\nwe\\'ve come up with.\\n\\nLegacy PBX migration gateway\\nAsterisk can be used as a fantastic bridge between an old PBX and the future. You can\\nplace it in front of the PBX as a gateway (and migrate users off the PBX as needs dictate),\\nor you can put it behind the PBX as a peripheral application server. You can even do\\nboth at the same time, as shown in Figure 15-1.\\nHere are some of the options you can implement:\\nKeep your old PBX, but evolve to IP\\nCompanies that have spent vast sums of money in the past few years buying proprietary PBX equipment want a way out of proprietary jail, but they can\\'t stomach\\nthe thought of throwing away all of their otherwise functioning equipment. No\\nproblem--Asterisk can solve all kinds of dilemmas, from replacing a voicemail\\nsystem to providing a way to add IP-based users beyond the nominal capacity of\\nthe system.\\nFind-me-follow-me\\nProvide the PBX a list of numbers where you can be reached, and it will ring them\\nall whenever a call to your DID (Direct Inward Dialing, a.k.a. phone number)\\narrives. Figure 15-2 illustrates this technology.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony | 323\\n\\x0cPassed to PBX\\n\\nInbound call to DID\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\n\\nCell phone\\n\\nRelayed out to\\ncell phone\\n\\nPRI/BRI/Analog\\nLegacy PBX\\n\\nPSTN\\n\\nDelivered to\\nhome office\\n\\nPBX telephone\\n\\nVoIP\\nIP telephone\\n\\nFigure 15-2.

VoIP-enabling a legacy PBX\\n\\nVoIP calling\\nIf a legacy telephony connection from an Asterisk PBX to an old PBX can be established, Asterisk can provide access to VoIP services, while the old PBX continues\\nto connect to the outside world as it always has. As a gateway, Asterisk simply\\nneeds to emulate the functions of the PSTN, and the old PBX won\\'t know that\\nanything has changed. Figure 15-3 shows how you can use Asterisk to VoIP-enable\\na legacy PBX.\\n\\nLow-barrier IVR\\nMany people confuse the term \"Interactive Voice Response,\" or IVR, with the Automated Attendant (AA). Since the Automated Attendant was the very first thing IVR was\\n324 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cused for, this is understandable. Nevertheless, to the telecom industry, the term IVR\\nrepresents far more than an AA. An AA generally does little more than present a way\\nfor callers to be transferred to extensions, and it is built into most proprietary voicemail\\nsystems--but IVR can be so much more.\\nIVR systems are generally very expensive not only to purchase, but also to configure.\\nA custom IVR system will usually require connectivity to an external database or application. Asterisk is arguably the perfect IVR, as it embraces the concepts of connectivity to databases and applications at its deepest level.\\nHere are a few examples of relatively simple IVRs that an Asterisk system could be used\\nto create:\\nWeather reporting\\nUsing the Internet, you can obtain text-based weather reports from around the\\nworld in a myriad of ways. Capturing these reports and running them through a\\npurpose-built parser (Perl would probably eat this up) would allow the information\\nto be available to the dialplan. Asterisk\\'s sound library already contains all of the\\nrequired prompts, so it would not be an onerous task to produce an interactive\\nmenu to play current forecasts for anywhere in the world.\\nMath programs\\nEd Guy (the architect of Pulver\\'s FWD network) did a presentation at AstriCon\\n2004 in which he talked about a little math program he\\'d cooked up for his daughter to use. The program took him no more than an hour to write. What it did was\\npresent her with a number of math questions, the answers to which she keyed into\\nthe telephone. When all the questions were tabulated, the system presented her\\nwith her score. This extremely simple Asterisk application would cost tens of\\nthousands of dollars to implement on any closed PBX platform, assuming it could\\nbe done at all. See Chapter 9 for further details. As is so often the case, things that\\nare simple for Asterisk would be either impossible or massively expensive with any\\nother IVR system.\\nDistributed IVR\\nThe cost of a proprietary IVR system is such that when a company with many small\\nretail locations wants to provide IVR, it is forced to transfer callers to a central\\nserver to process the transactions. With Asterisk, it becomes possible to distribute\\nthe application to each node and, thus, handle the requests locally. Literally thousands of little Asterisk systems deployed at retail locations across the world could\\nserve up IVR functionality in a way that would be impossible to achieve with any\\nother system. No more long-distance transfers to a central IVR server, no more\\nhuge trunking facility dedicated to the task--more power with less expense.\\nThese are three rather simple examples of the potential of Asterisk.\\n\\nThe Promise of Open Source Telephony | 325\\n\\x0cConference rooms\\nThis little gem is going to end up being one of the killer functions of Asterisk. In the\\nAsterisk community, everyone finds themselves using conference rooms more and\\nmore, for purposes such as these:\\n Small companies need an easy way for business partners to get together for a chat.\\n Sales teams have a meeting once per week where everyone can dial in from wherever\\nthey are.\\n Development teams designate a common place and time to update one another on\\nprogress.\\n\\nHome automation\\nAsterisk is still too much of an ber-geek\\'s tool to be able to serve in the average home,\\nbut with no more than average Linux and Asterisk skills, the following things become\\nplausible:\\nMonitoring the kids\\nParents who want to check up on the babysitter (or the kids home alone) could\\ndial an extension context protected by a password. Once authenticated, a two-way\\naudio connection would be created to all the IP phones in the house, allowing Mom\\nand Dad to listen for trouble. Creepy? Yes. But an interesting concept nonetheless.\\nLocking down your phones\\nGoing out for the night? Don\\'t want the babysitter tying up the phone? No problem!\\nA simple tweak to the dialplan, and the only calls that can be made are to 911, your\\ncell phone, and the pizza parlor. Any other call attempt will get the recording \"We\\nare paying you to babysit our kids, not make personal calls.\"\\nPretty evil, huh?\\nControlling the alarm system\\nYou get a call while on vacation that your Mom wants to borrow some cooking\\nutensils. She forgot her key and is standing in front of the house shivering. Piece\\nof cake; a call to your Asterisk system, a quick digit string into the context you\\ncreated for the purpose, and your alarm system is instructed to disable the alarm\\nfor 15 minutes. Mom better get her stuff and get out quick, though, or the cops\\'ll\\nbe showing up!\\nManaging teenagers\\' calls\\nHow about allocating a specific phone-time limit to your teenagers? To use the\\nphone, they have to enter their access codes. They can earn extra minutes by doing\\nchores, scoring all As, dumping that annoying bum with the bad haircut--you get\\nthe idea. Once they\\'ve used up their minutes... click... you get your phone back.\\nIncoming calls can be managed as well, via Caller ID. \"Donny, this is Suzy\\'s father.\\nShe is no longer interested in seeing you, as she has decided to raise her standards\\na bit. Also, you should consider getting a haircut.\"\\n326 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe Future of Asterisk\\nWe\\'ve come to love the Internet, both because it is so rich in content and inexpensive,\\nand, perhaps more importantly, because it allows us to define how we communicate.\\nAs its ability to carry richer forms of media advances, we\\'ll find ourselves using it more\\nand more. Once Internet voice delivers quality that rivals (or betters) the capabilities\\nof the PSTN, the phone company had better look for another line of business. The\\nPSTN will cease to exist and become little more than one more communications protocol that the Internet happily carries for us. As with most of the rest of the Internet,\\nopen source technologies will lead this transformation.\\n\\nSpeech Processing\\nThe dream of having our technical inventions talk to us is older than the telephone\\nitself. Each new advance in technology spurs a new wave of eager experimentation.\\nGenerally, results never quite meet expectations, possibly because as soon as a machine\\nsays something that sounds intelligent, most people assume that it is intelligent.\\nPeople who program and maintain computers realize their limitations and, thus, tend\\nto allow for their weaknesses. Everybody else just expects their computers and software\\nto work. The amount of thinking a user must do to interact with a computer is often\\ninversely proportional to the amount of thinking the design team did. Simple interfaces\\nbelie complex design decisions.\\nThe challenge, therefore, is to design a system that has anticipated the most common\\ndesires of its users, and that can also adroitly handle unexpected challenges.\\n\\nFestival\\nThe Festival text-to-speech server can transform text into spoken words. While this is\\na whole lot of fun to play with, there are many challenges to overcome.\\nFor Asterisk, an obvious value of text-to-speech might be the ability to have your telephone system read your emails back to you. Of course, if you\\'ve noticed the somewhat\\npoor grammar, punctuation, and spelling typically found in email messages these days,\\nyou can perhaps appreciate the challenges this poses.\\nOne cannot help but wonder if the emergence of text-to-speech will inspire a new\\ngeneration of people dedicated to proper writing. Seeing spelling and punctuation errors on the screen is frustrating enough; having to hear a computer speak such things\\nwill require a level of Zazen that few possess.\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\nIf text-to-speech is rocket science, speech recognition is science fiction.\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 327\\n\\x0cSpeech recognition can actually work very well, but unfortunately this is generally true\\nonly if you provide it with the right conditions--and the right conditions are not those\\nfound on a telephone network. Even a perfect PSTN connection is considered to be at\\nthe lowest acceptable limit for accurate speech recognition. Add in compressed and\\nlossy VoIP connections, or a cell phone, and you will discover far more limitations than\\nuses.\\nAsterisk now has an entire speech API so that outside companies (or even open source\\nprojects) can tie their speech recognition engines into Asterisk. One company that has\\ndone this is LumenVox. By using its speech recognition engine along with Asterisk, you\\ncan make voice-driven menus and IVR systems in record time! For more information,\\nsee http://www.lumenvox.com.\\n\\nHigh-Fidelity Voice\\nAs we gain access to more and more bandwidth, it becomes less and less easy to understand why we still use low-fidelity codecs. Many people do not realize that Skype\\nuses a higher fidelity than a telephone; it\\'s a large part of the reason why Skype has a\\nreputation for sounding so good.\\nIf you were ever to phone CNN, wouldn\\'t you love to hear James Earl Jones\\'s mellifluous voice saying \"This is CNN,\" instead of some tinny electronic recording? And if\\nyou think Allison Smith* sounds good through the phone, you should hear her in person!\\nIn the future, we will expect, and get, high-fidelity voice though our communications\\nequipment.\\nBeginning in Asterisk 1.4, there is limited support for the G.722 codec. As more and\\nmore hardware vendors start building support for high-fidelity voice into their VoIP\\nhardware, you\\'ll see more support in Asterisk for making better-than PSTN quality\\ncalls.\\n\\nVideo\\nWhile most of this book focuses on audio, video is also supported in many ways within\\nAsterisk. Video support is not complete, however. The problem is not so much one of\\nfunctionality as it is one of bandwidth and processing power. More significantly, it is\\nnot yet important enough to the community to merit the attention it needs.\\n\\n* Allison Smith is The Voice of Asterisk; it is her voice in all of the system prompts. To have Allison produce\\n\\nyour own prompt, simply visit http://thevoice.digium.com.\\n\\n328 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe challenge of video-conferencing\\nThe concept of video-conferencing has been around since the invention of the cathode\\nray tube. The telecom industry has been promising a video-conferencing device in every\\nhome for decades.\\nAs with so many other communications technologies, if you have video-conferencing\\nin your house, you are probably running it over the Internet, with a simple, inexpensive\\nwebcam. Still, it seems that people see video-conferencing as a bit gimmicky. Yes, you\\ncan see the person you\\'re talking to, but there\\'s something missing.\\n\\nWhy we love video-conferencing\\nVideo-conferencing promises a richer communications experience than the telephone.\\nRather than hearing a disembodied voice, the nuances of speech that come from eyeto-eye communication are possible.\\n\\nWhy video-conferencing may never totally replace voice\\nThere are some challenges to overcome, though, and not all of them are technical.\\nConsider this: using a plain telephone, people working from their home offices can\\nhave business conversations, unshowered, in their underwear, feet on the desk, coffee\\nin hand. A similar video conversation would require half an hour of grooming to prepare\\nfor, and couldn\\'t happen in the kitchen, on the patio, or... well, you get the idea.\\nAlso, the promise of eye-to-eye communication over video will never happen as long\\nas the focal points of the participants are not in line with the cameras. If you look at\\nthe camera, your audience will see you looking at them, but you won\\'t see them. If you\\nlook at your screen to see whom you are talking to, the camera will show you looking\\ndown at something--not at your audience. That looks impersonal. Perhaps if a videophone could be designed like a TelePromptR, where the camera was behind the screen,\\nit wouldn\\'t feel so unnatural. As it stands, there\\'s something psychological that\\'s missing. Video ends up being a gimmick.\\n\\nWireless\\nSince Asterisk is fully VoIP-enabled, wireless is all part of the package.\\n\\nWi-Fi\\nWi-Fi is going to be the office mobility solution for VoIP phones. This technology is\\nalready quite mature. The biggest hurdle is the cost of handsets, which can be expected\\nto improve as competitive pressure from around the world drives down prices.\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 329\\n\\x0cWi-MAX\\nSince we are so bravely predicting so many things, it\\'s not hard to predict that Wi-MAX\\nspells the beginning of the end for traditional cellular telephone networks.\\nWith wireless Internet access within the reach of most communities, what value will\\nthere be in expensive cellular service?\\n\\nUnified Messaging\\nThis is a term that has been hyped by the telecom industry for years, but adoption has\\nbeen far slower than predicted.\\nUnified Messaging is the concept of tying voice and text-messaging systems into one.\\nWith Asterisk, the two don\\'t need to be artificially combined, as Asterisk already treats\\nthem the same way.\\nJust by examining the terms, unified and messaging, we can see that the integration of\\nemail and voicemail must be merely the beginning; Unified Messaging needs to do a\\nlot more than just that if it is to deserve its name.\\nPerhaps we need to define \"messaging\" as communication that does not occur in real\\ntime. In other words, when you send a message, you expect that the reply may take\\nmoments, minutes, hours, or even days to arrive. You compose what you wish to say,\\nand your audience is expected to compose a reply.\\nContrast this with conversing, which happens in real time. When you talk to someone\\non a telephone connection, you expect no more than a few seconds\\' delay before the\\nresponse arrives.\\nIn 2002, Tim O\\'Reilly delivered a speech titled \"Watching the Alpha Geeks: OS X and\\nthe Next Big Thing\" (http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreil\\nly_wwdc_keynote.html), in which he talked about someone piping IRC through a textto-speech engine. One could imagine doing the reverse as well, allowing us to join an\\nIRC or instant messaging chat over our Wi-Fi phone, our Asterisk PBX providing the\\nspeech-to-text-to-speech translations.\\n\\nPeering\\nAs monopoly networks such as the PSTN give way to community-based networks like\\nthe Internet, there will be a period of time where it is necessary to interconnect the two.\\nWhile the traditional providers would prefer that the existing model be carried into the\\nnew paradigm, it is increasingly likely that telephone calls will become little more than\\nanother application the Internet happily carries.\\nBut a challenge remains: how to manage the telephone numbering plan with which we\\nare all familiar and comfortable?\\n\\n330 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cThe ITU defined a numbering plan in its E.164 specification. If you\\'ve used a telephone\\nto make a call across the PSTN, you can confidently state that you are familiar with the\\nconcept of E.164 numbering. Prior to the advent of publicly available VoIP, nobody\\ncared about E.164 except the telephone companies--nobody needed to.\\nNow that calls are hopping from PSTN to Internet to who-knows-what, some consideration must be given to E.164.\\n\\nENUM\\nIn response to this challenge, the IETF has sponsored the Telephone Number Mapping\\n(ENUM) working group, the purpose of which is to map E.164 numbers into the Domain Name System (DNS).\\nWhile the concept of ENUM is sound, it requires cooperation from the telecom industry\\nto achieve success. However, cooperation is not what the telecom industry is famous\\nfor and, thus, far ENUM has foundered.\\n\\nThe folks at e164.org are trying to contribute to the success of ENUM. You can log on\\nto this site, register your phone number, and inform the system of alternative methods\\nof communicating with you. This means that someone who knows your phone number\\ncan connect a VoIP call to you, as the e164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing\\nand protocol information needed to connect to your location.\\nAs more and more people publish VoIP connectivity information, fewer and fewer calls\\nwill be connected through the PSTN.\\n\\nDUNDi\\nDistributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) is an open routing protocol designed to maintain dynamic telecom routing tables between compatible systems (see\\nChapter 14 for more information). While Asterisk is currently the only PBX to support\\nDUNDi, the openness of the standard ensures that anyone can implement it.\\nDUNDi has huge potential, but it is very much in its infancy. This is the one to watch.\\n\\nChallenges\\nAs is true with any worthwhile thing, Asterisk will face challenges. Let\\'s take a glance\\nat what some of them may be.\\n\\nToo much change, too few standards\\nThese days, the Internet is changing so fast, and offers so much diverse content, that it\\nis impossible for even the most attentive geek to keep on top of it all. While this is as\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 331\\n\\x0cit should be, it also means that an enormous amount of technology churn is an inevitable part of keeping any communications system current.\\n\\nVoIP spam\\nYes, it\\'s coming. There will always be people who believe they have the right to inconvenience and harass others in their pursuit of money. Efforts are under way to try and\\naddress this, but only time will tell how efficacious they will be.\\n\\nFear, uncertainty, and doubt\\nThe industry is making the transition from ignorance to laughter. If Gandhi is correct,\\nwe can expect the fight to begin soon.\\nAs their revenue streams become increasingly threatened by open source telephony,\\nthe traditional industry players are certain to mount a fear campaign, in hopes of undermining the revolution.\\n\\nBottleneck engineering\\nThere is a rumor making the rounds that the major network providers will begin to\\nartificially cripple VoIP traffic by tagging and prioritizing the traffic of their premium\\nVoIP services and, worse, detecting and bumping any VoIP traffic generated by services\\nnot approved by them.\\nSome of this is already taking place, with service providers blocking traffic of certain\\ntypes through their networks, ostensibly due to some public service being rendered\\n(such as blocking popular file-sharing services to protect us from piracy). In the United\\nStates, the FCC has taken a clear stand on the matter and fined companies that engage\\nin such practices. In the rest of the world, regulatory bodies are not always as accepting\\nof VoIP.\\nWhat seems clear is that the community and the network will find ways around blockages, just as they always have.\\n\\nRegulatory wars\\nThe recently departed Chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission, Michael Powell, delivered a gift that may well have altered the path of the VoIP\\nrevolution. Rather than attempting to regulate VoIP as a telecom service, he has championed the concept that VoIP represents an entirely new way of communicating and\\nrequires its own regulatory space in which to evolve.\\nVoIP will become regulated, but not everywhere as a telephony service. Some of the\\nregulations that may be created include:\\n\\n332 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cPresence information for emergency services\\nOne of the characteristics of a traditional PSTN circuit is that it is always in the\\nsame location. This is very helpful to emergency services, as they can pinpoint the\\nlocation of a caller by identifying the address of the circuit from which the call was\\nplaced. The proliferation of cell phones has made this much more difficult to achieve, since a cell phone does not have a known address. A cell phone can be plugged\\ninto any network and can register to any server. If the phone does not identify its\\nphysical location, an emergency call from it will provide no clue as to the where\\nthe caller is. VoIP creates similar challenges.\\nCall monitoring for law enforcement agencies\\nLaw enforcement agencies have always been able to obtain wiretaps on traditional\\ncircuit-switched telephone lines. While regulations are being enacted that are designed to achieve the same end on the network, the technical challenge of delivering\\nthis functionality will probably never be completely solved. People value their privacy, and the more governments want to stifle it, the more effort will be put toward\\nmaintaining it.\\nAnti-monopolistic practices\\nThese practices are already being seen in the U.S., with fines being levied against\\nnetwork providers who attempt to filter traffic based on content.\\nWhen it comes to regulation, Asterisk is both a saint and a devil: a saint because it feeds\\nthe poor, and a devil because it empowers the phrackers and spammers like nothing\\never has. The regulation of open source telephony may in part be determined by how\\nwell the community regulates itself. Concepts such as DUNDi, which incorporate antispam processes, are an excellent start. On the other hand, concepts such as Caller IDspoofing are ripe with opportunities for abuse.\\n\\nQuality of service\\nDue to the best-effort reality of the TCP/IP-based Internet, it is not yet known how well\\nincreasing realtime VoIP traffic will affect overall network performance. Currently,\\nthere is so much excess bandwidth in the backbone that best-effort delivery is generally\\nquite good indeed. Still, it has been proven time and time again that whenever we are\\nprovided with more bandwidth, we figure out a way to use it up. The 1 MB DSL connection undreamt of five years ago is now barely adequate.\\nPerhaps a corollary of Moore\\'s Law will apply to network bandwidth. QoS may become moot, due to the network\\'s ability to deliver adequate performance without any\\nspecial processing. Organizations that require higher levels of reliability may elect to\\npay a premium for a higher grade of service. Perhaps the era of paying by the minute\\nfor long-distance connections will give way to paying by the millisecond for guaranteed\\nlow latency, or by the percentage point for reduced packet loss.

Just because the hardware and software are cheap doesn\\'t mean the solution will be. Asterisk does not come\\nout of the box ready to run; it has to be designed and built, and then maintained. While\\nthe base software is free, and the hardware costs will be based on commodity pricing,\\nit is fair to say that the configuration costs for a highly customized system will be a\\nsizeable part of the solution costs--in many cases, because of its high degree of complexity and configurability, more than would be expected with a traditional PBX.\\nThe rule of thumb is generally considered to be something like this: if it can be done\\nin the dialplan, the system design will be roughly the same as for any similarly featured\\ntraditional PBX. Beyond that, only experience will allow one to accurately estimate the\\ntime required to build a system.\\nThere is much to learn.\\n\\nOpportunities\\nOpen source telephony creates limitless opportunities. Here are some of the more\\ncompelling ones.\\n\\nTailor-made private telecommunications networks\\nSome people would tell you that price is the key, but we believe that the real reason\\nAsterisk will succeed is because it is now possible to build a telephone system as one\\nwould a web site: with complete, total customization of each and every facet of the\\nsystem. Customers have wanted this for years. Only Asterisk can deliver.\\n\\nLow barrier to entry\\nAnyone can contribute to the future of communicating. It is now possible for someone\\nwith an old $200 PC to develop a communications system that has intelligence to rival\\nthe most expensive proprietary systems. Granted, the hardware would not be production-ready, but there is no reason the software couldn\\'t be. This is one of the reasons\\nwhy closed systems will have a hard time competing. The sheer number of people who\\nhave access to the required equipment is impossible to equal in a closed shop.\\n This term refers to 99.999%, which is touted as the reliability of traditional telecom networks. Achieving five\\n\\nnines requires that service interruptions for an entire year total no more than 5 minutes and 15 seconds. Many\\npeople believe that VoIP will need to achieve this level of reliability before it can be expected to fully replace\\nthe PSTN. Many other people believe that the PSTN doesn\\'t even come close to five-nines reliability. We\\nbelieve that this could have been an excellent term to describe high reliability, but marketing departments\\nabuse it far too frequently.\\n\\n334 | Chapter 15: Asterisk: The Future of Telephony\\n\\x0cHosted solutions of similar complexity to corporate web sites\\nThe design of a PBX was always a kind of art form, but before Asterisk, the art lay in\\nfinding creative ways to overcome the limitations of the technology. With limitless\\ntechnology, those same creative skills can now be properly applied to the task of completely answering the needs of the customer. Open source telephony engines such as\\nAsterisk will enable this. Telecom designers will dance for joy, as their considerable\\ncreative skills will now actually serve the needs of their customers, rather than be focused on managing kludge.\\n\\nProper integration of communications technologies\\nUltimately, the promise of open source comes to nothing if it cannot fulfill the need\\npeople have to solve problems. The closed industries lost sight of the customer and\\ntried to fit the customer to the product.\\nOpen source telephony brings voice communications in line with other information\\ntechnologies. It is finally possible to properly begin the task of integrating email, voice,\\nvideo, and anything else we might conceive of over flexible transport networks (whether\\nwired or wireless), in response to the needs of the user, not the whims of monopolies.\\nWelcome to the future of telecom!\\n\\nThe Future of Asterisk | 335\\n\\x0c\\x0cAPPENDIX A\\n\\nVoIP Channels\\n\\nVoIP channels in Asterisk represent connections to the protocols they support. Each\\nprotocol you wish to use requires a configuration file, containing general parameters\\ndefining how your system handles the protocol as well as specific parameters for each\\nchannel (or device) you will want to reference in your dialplan. In this appendix, we\\'ll\\ntake an in-depth look at the IAX and SIP configuration files.\\n\\nIAX\\nThe IAX configuration file (iax.conf) contains all of the configuration information Asterisk needs to create and manage IAX protocol channels. The sections in the file are\\nseparated by headings, which are formed by a word framed in square brackets ([]). The\\nname in the brackets will be the name of the channel, with one notable exception: the\\n[general] section, which is not a channel, is the area where global protocol parameters\\nare defined.\\nThis section examines the various general and channel-specific settings for iax.conf.\\nWe will define each parameter and then give an example of its use. Certain options\\nmay have several valid arguments. These arguments are listed beside the option, separated with the pipe symbol (|). For example, bandwidth=low|medium|high means that\\nthe bandwidth option accepts one of the values low, medium, or high as its argument.\\nYou can insert comments anywhere in the iax.conf file, by preceding the comment text\\nwith the semicolon character (;). Everything to the right of the semicolon will be ignored. Feel free to use comments liberally.\\n\\nGeneral IAX Settings\\nThe first non-comment line in your iax.conf file must be the heading [general]. The\\nparameters in this section will apply to all connections using this protocol, unless defined differently in a specific channel\\'s definition. Since some of these settings can be\\ndefined on a per-channel basis, we have identified settings that are always global with\\nthe tag \"(global)\" and those that can optionally be configured for individual channels\\n\\x0cwith the tag \"(channel).\" If you define a channel parameter under the [general] section,\\nyou do not need to define it in each channel; its value becomes the default. Keep in\\nmind that setting a parameter in the [general] section does not prevent you from setting\\nit differently for specific channels; it merely makes this setting the default. Also keep\\nin mind that not defining these parameters may, in some cases, cause a system default\\nto be used instead.\\nHere are the parameters that you can configure:\\naccountcode (channel)\\n\\nThe account code can be defined on a per-user basis. If defined, this account code\\nwill be assigned to a call record whenever no specific user account code is set. The\\naccountcode name configured will be used as the filename.csv in\\nthe /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/ directory to store Call Detail Records (CDRs) for the\\nuser/peer/friend:\\naccountcode=iax-username\\n\\nadsi (channel)\\n\\nSupport for ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) can be enabled if you have\\nADSI-compatible CPE equipment:\\nadsi=yes|no\\n\\nallow and disallow (channel)\\n\\nSpecific codecs can be allowed or disallowed, limiting codec use to those preferred\\nby the system designer. allow and disallow can also be defined on a per-channel\\nbasis. Keep in mind that allow statements in the [general] section will carry over\\nto each of the channels, unless you reset with a disallow=all. Codec negotiation\\nis attempted in the order in which the codecs are defined. Best practice suggests\\nthat you define disallow=all, followed by explicit allow statements for each codec\\nyou wish to use. If nothing is defined, allow=all is assumed:\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ilbc\\n\\namaflags (channel)\\n\\nAutomatic Message Accounting (AMA) is defined in the Telcordia Family of Documents listed under FR-AMA-1. These documents specify standard mechanisms for\\ngeneration and transmission of CDRs. You can specify one of four AMA flags to\\napply to all IAX connections:\\namaflags=default|omit|billing|documentation\\n\\nauthdebug (global)\\n\\nYou can minimize the amount of authorization debugging by disabling it with\\nauthdebug=no. Authorization debugging is enabled by default if not explicitly\\ndisabled:\\n338 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cauthdebug=no\\n\\nautokill (global)\\n\\nTo minimize the danger of stalling when a host is unreachable, you can set\\nautokill to yes to specify that any new connection should be torn down if an ACK\\nis not received within 2,000 ms. (This is obviously not advised for hosts with high\\nlatency.) Alternatively, you can replace yes with the number of milliseconds to wait\\nbefore considering a peer unreachable. autokill configures the wait for all IAX2\\npeers, but you can configure it differently for individual peers with the use of the\\nqualify command:\\n\\nbandwidth (channel)\\nbandwidth is a shortcut that may help you get around using disallow=all and multiple allow statements to specify which codecs to use. The valid options are:\\nhigh\\n\\nAllows all codecs (G.723.1, GSM, law, alaw, G.726, ADPCM, slinear, LPC10,\\nG.729, Speex, iLBC)\\n\\nmedium\\n\\nAllows all codecs except slinear, law, and alaw\\n\\nlow\\n\\nAllows all medium codecs except G.726 and ADPCM\\nbandwidth=low|medium|high\\n\\nbindport and bindaddr (global)\\n\\nThese optional parameters allow you to control the IP interface and port on which\\nyou wish to accept IAX connections. If omitted, the port will be set to 4569, and\\nall IP addresses in your Asterisk system will accept incoming IAX connections. If\\nmultiple bind addresses are configured, only the defined interface will accept IAX\\nconnections.* The address 0.0.0.0 tells Asterisk to listen on all interfaces:\\n\\ncodecpriority (channel)\\nThe codecpriority option controls which end of an inbound call leg will have\\npriority over the negotiation of codecs. If set in the [general] section, the selected\\n\\noptions will be inherited by all user entries in the channel configuration file; however, they can be defined in the individual user entries for more granular control.\\nIf set in both the [general] and user sections, the user entry will override the entry\\n\\n* Currently, Asterisk will only work with a single bindaddr option. If you wish to listen to more than one address,\\n\\nyou\\'ll need to use 0.0.0.0. Note that Asterisk will work in a multihomed environment, but not with multiaddress interfaces. Asterisk will use the system\\'s routing table to select which interface it sends the packet\\nout on and it will use the primary address on that interface as the source.\\n\\nIAX | 339\\n\\x0cthat is configured in the [general] section. If this parameter is not configured, the\\nvalue defaults to host.\\nValid options include:\\ncaller\\n\\nThe inbound caller has priority over the host.\\nhost\\n\\nThe host has priority over the inbound caller.\\ndisabled\\n\\nCodec preferences are not considered; this is the default behavior before the\\nimplementation of codec preferences.\\nreqonly\\n\\nCodec preferences are ignored, and the call is accepted only if the requested\\ncodec is available:\\ncodecpriority=caller|host|disabled|reqonly\\n\\ndelayreject (global)\\n\\nIf an incorrect password is received on an IAX channel, this will delay the sending\\nof the REGREQ or AUTHREP reject messages, which will help to secure against bruteforce password attacks. The delay time is 1,000 ms:\\ndelayreject=yes|no\\n\\nforcejitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nSince Asterisk attempts to bridge channels (endpoints) directly together, the endpoints are normally allowed to perform jitter buffering themselves. However, if the\\nendpoints have a poor jitter buffer implementation, you may wish to force Asterisk\\nto perform jitter buffering no matter what. You can force jitter buffering to be\\nperformed with forcejitterbuffer=yes:\\nforcejitterbuffer=yes\\n\\niaxthreads and iaxmaxthreads (global)\\nThe iaxthreads setting specifies the number of IAX helper threads that are created\\n\\non startup to handle IAX communications.\\nThe iaxmaxthreads setting specifies the maximum number of additional IAX helper\\nthreads that may be spawned to handle higher IAX traffic levels:\\n\\njitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nJitter refers to the varying latency between packets. When packets are sent from\\nan end device, they are sent at a constant rate with very little latency variation.\\nHowever, as the packets traverse the Internet, the latency between the packets may\\nbecome varied; thus, they may arrive at the destination at different times, and\\npossibly even out of order.\\n340 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cThe jitter buffer is, in a sense, a staging area where the packets can be reordered\\nand delivered in a regulated stream. Without a jitter buffer, the user may perceive\\nanomalies in the stream, experienced as static, strange sound effects, garbled\\nwords, or, in severe cases, missed words or syllables.\\nThe jitter buffer affects only data received from the far end. Any data you transmit\\nwill not be affected by your jitter buffer, as the far end will be responsible for the\\nde-jittering of its incoming connections.\\nThe jitter buffer is enabled with the use of jitterbuffer=yes:\\njitterbuffer=yes|no\\n\\nlanguage (channel)\\n\\nThis sets the language flag to whatever you define. The global default language is\\nEnglish. The language that is set is sent by the channel as an information element.\\nIt is also used by applications such as SayNumber() that have different files for different languages. Keep in mind that languages other than English are not explicitly\\ninstalled on the system, and it is up to you to configure the system to ensure that\\nthe language you specify is handled properly:\\nlanguage=en\\n\\nmailboxdetail (global)\\nIf mailboxdetail is set to yes, the new/old message count is sent to the user, instead\\nof a simple statement of whether new and old messages exist. mailboxdetail can\\n\\nalso be set on a per-peer basis:\\nmailboxdetail=yes\\n\\nmaxjitterbuffer (channel)\\n\\nThis parameter is used to set the maximum size of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds.\\nBe sure not to set maxjitterbuffer too high, or you will needlessly increase your\\nlatency:\\n\\nmaxjitterinterps (channel)\\n\\nThe maximum number of interpolation frames the jitter buffer should return in a\\nrow. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to indicate silence, the jitter\\nbuffer will assume silence has begun after returning this many interpolations. This\\nprevents interpolating throughout a long silence:\\n\\nmaxregexpire and minregexpire (channel)\\n\\nSpecifies the maximum and minimum time intervals for registration expiration, in\\nseconds:\\n\\nIAX | 341\\n\\x0cmohinterpret (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies a preference for which music-on-hold class this channel\\nshould listen to when put on hold if the music class has not been set on the channel\\nwith Set(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan, and the peer channel\\nputting this all on hold did not suggest a music class.\\nIf this option is set to passthrough, then the hold message will always be passed\\nthrough as signaling instead of generating hold music locally.\\nThis option may be specified globally, or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohinterpret=default\\n\\nmohsuggest (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies which music-on-hold class (as defined in musiconhold.conf)\\nto suggest to the peer channel when this channel places the peer on hold. It may\\nbe specified globally or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohsuggest=default\\n\\nnochecksums (global)\\n\\nIf set, Asterisk will disable the calculation of UDP checksums and no longer check\\nUDP checksums on systems supporting this feature:\\nnochecksums=yes\\n\\nregcontext (channel)\\n\\nBy specifying the context that contains the actions to perform, you can configure\\nAsterisk to perform a number of actions when a peer registers to your server. This\\noption works in conjunction with regexten, which specifies the extension to execute. If no regexten is configured, the peer name is used as the extension. Asterisk\\nwill dynamically create and destroy a NoOp at priority 1 for the extension. All actions\\nto be performed upon registration should start at priority 2. More than one\\nregexten may be supplied, if separated by an &. regcontext can be set on a per-peer\\nbasis or globally:\\nregcontext=registered-phones\\n\\nregexten (channel)\\nThe regexten option is used in conjunction with regcontext to specify the extension\\nto be executed within the configured context. If regexten is not explicitly config-\\n\\nured, the peer name is used as the extension to match:\\nregexten=myphone\\n\\nresyncthreshold (channel)\\n\\nThe resynchronize threshold is used to resynchronize the jitter buffer if a significant\\nchange is detected over a few frames, assuming that the change was caused by a\\ntimestamp mixup. The resynchronization threshold is defined as the measured\\njitter plus the resyncthreshold value, defined in milliseconds:\\n\\n342 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0crtautoclear (global)\\n\\nThis specifies whether or not Asterisk should auto-expire friends created on the fly\\non the same schedule as if they had just registered. If set to yes, when the registration expires, the friend will vanish from the configuration until requested again. If\\nset to an integer, friends expire within that number of seconds instead of the normal\\nregistration interval:\\nrtautoclear=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nrtcachefriends (global)\\nIf rtcachefriends is turned on, Asterisk will cache friends that come from the re-\\n\\naltime engine, just as if they had come from iax.conf. This often helps with items\\nsuch as message-waiting indications on realtime peers:\\nrtcachefriends=yes|no\\n\\nrtignoreregexpire (global)\\nIf rtignoreregexpire is set to yes, and a realtime peer\\'s registration has expired\\n\\n(based on its registration interval), then Asterisk will continue to use the IP address\\nand port stored in the database:\\nrtignoreregexpire=yes|no\\n\\nrtupdate (global)\\nIf set to yes Asterisk will update the IP address, origination port, and registration\\nperiod of a peer upon registration. Defaults to yes:\\nrtupdate=yes|no\\n\\ntos (global)\\n\\nAsterisk can set the Type of Service (TOS) bits in the IP header to help improve\\nperformance on routers that respect TOS bits in their routing calculations. The\\nAF21, AF22, AF23, AF31, AF32, AF33, AF41, AF42, AF43, and ef (expedited forwarding).\\nYou may also use a numeric value for the TOS bits.\\nFor more information, see the doc/ip-tos.txt file in the Asterisk source directory.\\ntrunk (channel)\\nIAX2 trunking enables Asterisk to send media (as mini-frames) from multiple\\nchannels using a single header. The reduction in overhead makes the IAX2 protocol\\nmore efficient when sending multiple streams to the same endpoint (usually another Asterisk server):\\ntrunk=yes|no\\n\\ntrunkfreq (channel)\\ntrunkfreq is used to control how frequently you send trunk messages, in milliseconds. Trunk messages are sent in conjunction with the trunk=yes command:\\n\\nIAX | 343\\n\\x0ctrunktimestamps (channel)\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should send timestamps for the individual subframes within trunk frames. There is a small bandwidth penalty for sending these\\ntimestamps (less than 1 kbps/call), but they ensure that frame timestamps get sent\\nend-to-end properly. If both ends of all your trunks go directly to TDM and your\\ntrunkfreq equals the frame length for your codecs, you can probably suppress\\nthese. The receiver must also support this feature, although it does not also need\\nto have it enabled:\\ntrunktimestamps=yes|no\\n\\nRetrieving Dialplan Information from a Remote Asterisk Box\\nAsterisk can retrieve dialplan information from another Asterisk box with the use of a\\nswitch => statement. When this occurs, the Asterisk IAX channel driver must wait for\\na reply from the remote box before it can continue with other IAX-related processes.\\nThis is especially troubling when you have multiple switch statements nested throughout multiple boxes: if a switch statement has to traverse several boxes, there could be\\nan appreciable delay before a result is returned.\\nWhen the global iaxcompat option is set to yes, Asterisk will spawn a separate thread\\nwhen the switch lookup is being performed. The use of this thread allows the main IAX\\nchannel driver to continue on with other processes while the thread waits for the reply.\\nA small performance hit is incurred with this option:\\niaxcompat=yes|no\\n\\nRegistering to Other Servers with register Statements\\nThe register switch (register =>) is used to register your Asterisk box to a remote server\\n--this lets the remote end know where you are, in case you are configured with a\\ndynamic IP address. Note that register statements are used only when the remote end\\nhas you configured as a peer, and when host=dynamic.\\nThe basic format for a register statement is:\\nregister => username:password@remote-host\\n\\nThe password is optional (if not configured on the remote system).\\nAlternatively, you can specify an RSA key by framing the appropriate RSA key name\\nin square brackets ([]):\\nregister => username:[rsa-key-name]@remote-host\\n\\n Asterisk RSA keys are typically located in /var/lib/asterisk/keys/. You can generate your own keys using the\\n\\nastkeygen script.\\n\\n344 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cBy default, register requests will be sent via port 4569. You can direct them to a different port by explicitly specifying it, as follows:\\nregister => username:password@remote-host:1234\\n\\nIAX Channel Definitions\\nWith the general settings defined, we can now define our channels. Defining a guest\\nchannel is recommended whenever you want to accept anonymous IAX calls. This is\\na very common way for folks in the Asterisk community to contact one another. Before\\nyou decide that this is not for you, keep in mind that anyone whom you want to be able\\nto connect to you via IAX (without you specifically configuring an account for them)\\nwill need to connect as a guest. This account, in effect, becomes your \"IAX phone\\nnumber.\" Your guest channel definition should look something like this:\\n[guest]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=incoming\\ncallerid=\"Incoming IAX Guest\"\\n\\nNo doubt the spammers will find a way to harass these addresses, but\\nin the short term this has not proven to be a problem. In the long term,\\nwe\\'ll probably use DUNDi (see Chapter 14 for more information).\\n\\nIf you wish to accept calls from the Free World Dialup network, Asterisk comes with\\na predefined security key that ensures that anonymous connections cannot spoof an\\nincoming Free World Dialup call. You\\'ll want to set up an iaxfwd channel:\\n[iaxfwd]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=incoming\\nauth=rsa\\ninkeys=freeworlddialup\\n\\nIf you have resources advertised on a DUNDi network, the associated user must be\\ndefined in iax.conf:\\n[dundi]\\ntype=user\\ndbsecret=dundi/secret\\ncontext=dundi-incoming\\n\\nIf you have IAX-based devices (such as an IAXy), or IAX-based users at a remote node,\\nyou may want to provide them with their own user definition with which to connect\\nto the system.\\nLet\\'s say you have a user on a remote node for whom you want to define an IAX user.\\nWe\\'ll call this hypothetical user sushi. The user definition might look something like\\nthis:\\n\\nIAX | 345\\n\\x0c[sushi]\\ntype=user\\ncontext=local_users\\nsecret=wasabi\\ntransfer=no\\njitterbuffer=yes\\naccountcode=seaweed\\nlanguage=en\\n\\nIAX Authentication\\nIAX provides authentication mechanisms to allow for a reasonable level of security\\nbetween endpoints. This does not mean that the audio information cannot be captured\\nand decoded, but it does mean that you can more carefully control who is allowed to\\nmake connections to your system. Three levels of security are supported on IAX channels. The auth option defines which authentication method to use on the channel:\\nplaintext, md5, or rsa.\\nplaintext, in IAX, offers very little security. While it will prevent connection to the\\n\\nchannel unless a valid password is supplied, the fact that the password is stored in\\niax.conf in plain text and is transmitted and received as plain text makes this a very\\ninsecure authentication method.\\nmd5 improves the security on the network connection; however, both ends still require\\na plain-text secret in the iax.conf file. Here\\'s how it works: Box A requests a connection\\n\\nwith Box B, which in turn replies with an authorization request including a randomly\\ngenerated number. Box A then generates an MD5 hash using the value supplied in the\\nsecret field of iax.conf and the random number from Box B. The hash is returned in\\nthe authorization reply, and Box B compares it to the hash it generated locally. If the\\nhashes match, authorization is granted.\\nThe rsa method provides the most security. Before using RSA authentication, each end\\nmust create a public and private key pair through the astgenkey script, typically located\\nin /usr/src/asterisk/contrib/scripts/. The public key must then be given to the far end.\\nEach end of the circuit must include the public key of the far end in its channel definition, using the inkeys and outkey parameters.\\nRSA keys are stored in /var/lib/asterisk/keys/. Public keys are named name.pub; private\\nkeys are named name.key. Private keys must be encrypted with 3DES.\\n\\nIncoming calls from this user will arrive in the context local_users and will ask the\\nsystem to accept the Caller ID Happy Tempura <(800) 555-1234>. The system will be\\nwilling to accept MD5, plain-text, or RSA authentication from this user, so long as the\\npassword wasabi is provided and the call comes from the IP address 192.168.1.100. All\\ncalls related to this channel will be assigned the account code seaweed.

You can determine the latency between you and the remote host, and whether\\nthe peer is alive, with qualify=yes. To minimize the amount of overhead for multiple\\ncalls going to the same peer, you can trunk them.\\nTrunking is unique to IAX and is designed to take advantage of the fact that two large\\nsites may have multiple, simultaneous VoIP connections between them. IAX trunking\\nreduces overhead by loading the audio from several concurrent calls into each signaling\\npacket. You can enable trunking for a channel with trunk=yes in iax.conf.\\nFigure A-1 shows a channel with trunking disabled, and Figure A-2 shows a channel\\nwith trunking enabled.\\n\\nChannel-specific parameters\\nNow, let\\'s take a look at the channel-specific parameters:\\n You can think of IAX trunking as carpooling for VoIP packets.

Trunking enabled\\n\\ncallerid\\n\\nYou can set a suggested Caller ID string for a user or peer with callerid. If you\\ndefine a Caller ID field for a user, any calls that come in on that channel will have\\nthat Caller ID assigned to them, regardless of what the far end sends to you. If you\\ndefine Caller ID for a peer, you are requesting that the far end use that to identify\\nyou (although you have no way of ensuring it will do so). If you want incoming\\nusers to be able to define their own Caller IDs (i.e., for guests), make sure you do\\nnot set the callerid field:\\n\\ndefaultip\\nThe defaultip setting complements host=dynamic. If a host has not yet registered\\n\\nwith your server, you\\'ll attempt to send messages to the default IP address configured here:\\n\\ninkeys\\n\\nYou can use the inkeys option to authenticate a user with the use of an RSA key.\\nTo associate more than one RSA key with a user channel definition, separate the\\nkey names with a colon (:). Any one of those keys will be sufficient to validate a\\nconnection. The \"inkey\" is the public key you distribute to your users:\\ninkeys=server_one:server_two\\n\\nmailbox\\n\\nIf you associate a mailbox with a peer within the channel definition, voicemail will\\nsend a message waiting indication (MWI) to the nodes on the end of that channel.\\nIf the mailbox number is in a voicemail context other than default, you can specify\\nit as mailbox @ context. To associate multiple mailboxes with a single peer, use\\nmultiple mailbox statements:\\n\\noutkey\\n\\nYou can use the outkey option to authenticate a peer with the use of an RSA key.\\nOnly one RSA key may be used for outgoing authentication. The \"outkey\" is not\\ndistributed; it is your private key:\\noutkey=private_key\\n\\n348 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cqualify\\n\\nYou can set qualify to yes, no, or a time in milliseconds. If you set qualify=yes,\\nPING messages will be sent periodically to the remote peers to determine whether\\nthey are available and what the latency between replies is. The peers will respond\\nwith PONG messages. A peer will be determined unreachable if no reply is received\\nwithin 2,000 ms (to change this default, instead set qualify to the number of milliseconds to wait for the reply).\\nqualifyfreqok and qualifyfreqnotok\\nThese two settings are used to determine how frequently Asterisk should ping a\\npeer when qualify is set. The qualifyfreqok setting determines how often to ping\\nthe peer when it\\'s in an OK state, and qualifyfreqnotok determines how often to\\nping the peer when it\\'s not in an OK state.\\nqualifysmoothing\\nYou can set qualifysmoothing to yes or no. If enabled, Asterisk will take the average\\nof the last two qualify times. This helps eliminate having peers marked as LAGGED,\\n\\nespecially on a lossy network.\\nsendani\\n\\nThe SS7 PSTN network uses Automatic Number Identification (ANI) to identify a\\ncaller, and Caller ID is what is delivered to the user. The Caller ID is generated\\nfrom the ANI, so it\\'s easy to confuse the two. Blocking Caller ID sets a privacy flag\\non the ANI, but the backbone network still knows where the call is coming from:\\nsendani=yes\\n\\nANI has been around for a while. Its original purpose was to deliver\\nthe billing number of the originating party on a long-distance call\\nto the terminating office. Unlike Caller ID, ANI does not require\\nSS7, as it can be transmitted using DTMF. Also, ANI cannot be\\nblocked.\\n\\ntransfer\\n\\nYou can set transfer to yes, no, or mediaonly. If set to yes, Asterisk will transfer the\\ncall away from itself if it can, in order to make the packet path shorter between the\\ntwo endpoints. (This obviously won\\'t work if Asterisk needs to transcode or translate between protocols, or if network conditions don\\'t allow the two endpoints to\\ntalk directly to each other.) If it is set to no, Asterisk will not try to transfer the call\\naway from itself.\\nIf set to mediaonly, Asterisk will attempt to transfer the media stream so that it goes\\ndirectly between the two endpoints, but the call signaling (call setup and teardown\\nmessages) will still go through Asterisk. This is useful because it ensures that call\\ndetail records are still accurate, even though the media is no longer flowing through\\nthe Asterisk box.\\n\\nIAX | 349\\n\\x0cSIP\\nJust as with IAX, the SIP configuration file (sip.conf) contains configuration information\\nfor SIP channels. The headings for the channel definitions are formed by a word framed\\nin square brackets ([])--again, with the exception of the [general] section, where we\\ndefine global SIP parameters. Don\\'t forget to use comments generously in your\\nsip.conf file. Precede the comment text with a semicolon; everything to the right will\\nbe ignored.\\n\\nGeneral SIP Parameters\\nThe following options are to be used within the [general] section of sip.conf:\\nallowexternalinvites\\nIf set to no, this setting disables INVITE and REFER messages to non-local domains. See the domain setting.\\nallowexternalinvites=yes|no\\n\\nallowguest\\n\\nIf set to no, this disallows guest SIP connections. The default is to allow guest\\nconnections. SIP normally requires authentication, but you can accept calls from\\nusers who do not support authentication (i.e., do not have a secret field defined).\\nCertain SIP appliances (such as the Cisco Call Manager v4.1) do not support authentication, so they will not be able to connect if you set allowguest=no:\\nallowguest=no|yes\\n\\nallowoverlap\\nIf set to no, overlap dialing is disabled:\\nallowoverlap=no|yes\\n\\nallowsubscribe\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not to allow external devices to subscribe to extension status\\n(as set in the hint priority). Defaults to yes:\\nallowsubscribe=yes|no\\n\\nallowtransfers\\nIf set to no, transfers are disabled for all SIP calls, unless specifically enabled on a\\n\\nper-user or per-peer basis:\\nallowtransfers=no|yes\\n\\nalwaysauthreject\\n\\nIf this option is enabled, whenever Asterisk rejects an INVITE or REGISTER, it\\nwill always reject it with a 401 Unauthorized message instead of letting the caller\\nknow whether there was a matching user or peer for his request:\\nalwaysauthreject=no|yes\\n\\n350 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cautodomain\\n\\nSet this option to yes to have Asterisk add the local hostname and local IP addresses\\nto the domain list:\\nautodomain=yes|no\\n\\nbindaddr and bindport\\n\\nThese optional parameters allow you to control the IP interface and port on which\\nyou wish to accept SIP connections. If omitted, the port will be set to 5060, and all\\nIP addresses in your Asterisk system will accept incoming SIP connections. If multiple bind addresses are configured, only those interfaces will listen for connections.\\nThe address 0.0.0.0 tells Asterisk to listen on all interfaces:\\n\\nbuggymwi\\n\\nThis setting allows Asterisk to send a message-waiting indication to certain Cisco\\nSIP phones with firmware that doesn\\'t fully support the message-waiting Internet\\nRFC. Enable this option to avoid getting error messages when sending MWI messages on phones with this bug:\\nbuggymwi=no|yes\\n\\ncallevents\\n\\nSet this to yes when you want SIP to generate Manager events. This will be important if you have external programs that use the Asterisk Manager interface, such\\nas the Flash Operator Panel:\\ncallevents=yes\\n\\ncheckmwi\\n\\nThis option specifies the default amount of time, in seconds, between mailbox\\nchecks for peers:\\n\\ncompactheaders\\n\\nYou can set compactheaders to yes or no. If it\\'s set to yes, the SIP headers will use\\na compact format, which may be required if the size of the SIP header is larger than\\nthe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of your IP headers, causing the IP packet\\nto be fragmented. Do not use this option unless you know what you are doing:\\ncompactheaders=yes|no\\n\\ndefaultexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the default SIP registration expiration time, in seconds, for incoming and\\noutgoing registrations. A client will normally define this value when it initially\\nregisters, so the default value you set here will be used only if the client does not\\nspecify a timeout when it registers. If you are registering to another user agent server\\n(UAS), this is the registration timeout that it will send to the far end:\\nSIP | 351\\n\\x0c\\ndirectrtpsetup\\n\\nThis setting configures the direct RTP setup between two endpoints without the\\nneed for RE-INVITEs.\\ndirectrtpsetup=yes|no\\n\\nAs of the time that this book was written, directrtpsetup was still\\nconsidered experimental, and as such should not be enabled unless\\nyou fully understand the consequences. This option will not work\\nfor video calls and cases where the called party sends RTP payloads\\nand FMTP headers in the 200 OK response that do not match the\\ncaller\\'s INVITE request.\\n\\ndomain\\n\\nSets the default domain for this Asterisk server. If configured, Asterisk will allow\\nINVITE and REFER messages only to nonlocal domains. You can use the CLI command sip show domains to list the local domains:\\ndomain=example.com\\n\\ndumphistory\\n\\nYou can set dumphistory to yes or no to enable or disable the printing of the SIP\\nhistory report at the end of the SIP dialog. The SIP history is printed to the DEBUG\\nlogging channel:\\ndumphistory=yes|no\\n\\nexternhost\\nexternhost takes a fully qualified domain name as its argument. If Asterisk is behind\\n\\nNAT, the SIP header will normally use the private IP address assigned to the server.\\nIf you set this option, Asterisk will perform periodic DNS lookups on the hostname\\nand replace the private IP address with the IP address returned from the DNS\\nlookup:\\nexternhost=my.hostname.tld\\n\\nThe use of externhost is not recommended in production systems,\\nbecause if the IP address of the server changes, the wrong IP address\\nwill be set in the SIP headers until the next lookup is performed.\\nThe use of externip is recommended instead.\\n\\nexternip\\nexternip takes an IP address as its argument. If Asterisk is behind NAT, the SIP\\n\\nheader will normally use the private IP address assigned to the server. The remote\\nserver will not know how to route back to this address; thus, it must be replaced\\nwith a valid, routeable address:\\n\\n352 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0c\\nexternrefresh\\nIf externhost is used, externrefresh configures how long, in seconds, should pass\\n\\nbetween DNS lookups:\\n\\n\\nThis parameter can be set when dealing with peers that incorrectly use the wrong\\nencoding for the G.726 codec. This setting tells Asterisk to use AAL2 packing order\\ninstead of RFC3551 packing order if the peer negotiates G726-32 audio. Ordinarily, that would be contrary to the RFC3551 specification, as the peer should be\\nnegotiating AAL2-G726-32 instead. You may need to set this option if you\\'re using\\na Sipura or Grandstream device:\\n\\nignoreregexpire (global)\\nIf ignoreregexpire is set to yes, Asterisk could do one of two things, for:\\n\\nNon-realtime peers\\nWhen their registration expires, the information will not be removed from\\nmemory or the Asterisk database. If you attempt to place a call to the peer, the\\nexisting information will be used in spite of it having expired.\\nRealtime peers\\nWhen the peer is retrieved from realtime storage, the registration information\\nwill be used regardless of whether it has expired or not; if it expires while the\\nrealtime peer is still in memory (due to caching or other reasons), the information will not be removed from realtime storage:\\nignoreregexpire=yes|no\\n\\njbenable\\n\\nEnables the use of an RTP jitter buffer on the receiving side of a SIP channel. Defaults to no. An enabled jitter buffer will be used only if the sending side can create\\nand the receiving side cannot accept jitter. The SIP channel can accept jitter; thus\\na jitter buffer on the receiving side will be used only if it is forced and enabled:\\njbenable=yes|no\\n\\njbforce\\n\\nForces the use of the RTP jitter buffer on the receiving side of a SIP channel. Defaults\\nto no:\\njbforce=yes|no\\n\\njbimpl\\n\\nThis setting is used to specify which jitter buffer implementation to use, the\\nfixed jitter buffer or the adaptive jitter buffer. If the fixed jitter buffer is used, it\\nwill always be the size defined by jbmaxsize. If the adaptive jitter buffer is specified,\\nSIP | 353\\n\\x0cthen the jitter buffer will vary in size up to the maximum size specified by jbmax\\nsize. This setting defaults to fixed:\\njbimpl=fixed|adaptive\\n\\njblog\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not to enable jitter buffer frame logging. Defaults to no:\\njblog=yes|no\\n\\njbmaxsize\\n\\nSets the maximum length of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds:\\n\\njbresyncthreshold\\n\\nJump in the frame timestamps over which the jitter buffer is resynchronized. This\\nis useful to improve the quality of the voice, with big jumps in/broken timestamps\\nthat are usually sent from exotic devices and programs. Defaults to 1000:\\n\\nlimitonpeers\\n\\nThis setting tells Asterisk to apply call limits to peers only. This will improve call\\nlimits and status notification for devices set to type=friend because the peer limit\\nwill be checked, and not create a separate limit for the user and peer portions of a\\nfriend:\\nlimitonpeers=yes|no\\n\\nlocalnet\\nlocalnet is used to tell Asterisk which IP addresses are considered local, so that\\nthe address in the SIP header can be translated to that specified by externip or the\\nIP address can be looked up with externhost. The IP addresses should be specified\\n\\nin CIDR notation:\\n\\nmatchexterniplocally\\n\\nSpecifies that Asterisk should substitute the externip or externhost setting only if\\nit matches your localnet setting. Unless you have some sort of strange network\\nsetup you will not need to enable this:\\nmatchexterniplocally=yes|no\\n\\nmaxexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the maximum amount of time, in seconds, until a peer\\'s registration\\nexpires:\\n\\n354 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cminexpiry\\n\\nThis sets the minimum amount of time, in seconds, allowed for a registration or\\nsubscription:\\n\\nnotifymimetype\\n\\nThis takes as its argument a string specifying the MIME type used for the messagewaiting indication (MWI) in the SIP NOTIFY message. The most common setting\\nfor this field is text/plain, although it can be customized if need be:\\nnotifymimetype=text/plain\\n\\nnotifyringing\\n\\nSpecifies whether Asterisk should notify subscriptions on RINGING state:\\nnotifyringing=yes|no\\n\\nnotifyhold\\n\\nSpecifies whether Asterisk should notify subscriptions on HOLD state:\\nnotifyhold=yes|no\\n\\npedantic\\n\\nYou can set pedantic to yes or no. Setting it to yes enables slow pedantic checking\\nfor phones that require it, such as the Pingtel, and enables more strict SIP RFC\\ncompliancy. In an effort to improve performance, SIP RFC compliance is not normally strictly adhered to:\\npedantic=yes\\n\\nrealm\\n\\nThis option sets the realm for digest authentication. Set realm to your fully qualified\\ndomain name, which must be globally unique:\\nrealm=mybox.example.com\\n\\nrecordhistory\\n\\nYou can set recordhistory to yes or no to enable or disable SIP history recording\\nfor all channels:\\nrecordhistory=yes|no\\n\\nregisterattempts\\n\\nSpecifies how many times Asterisk will attempt its outbound registrations before\\ngiving up. This setting defaults to 0, which means that Asterisk will retry\\nindefinitely:\\n\\nregistertimeout\\n\\nSpecifies how often Asterisk should attempt to re-register to other devices:\\n\\nSIP | 355\\n\\x0crelaxdtmf\\n\\nYou can set relaxdtmf to yes or no. Setting it to yes will relax the DTMF detection\\nhandling. Use this if Asterisk is having a difficult time determining the DTMF on\\nthe SIP channel. Note that this may cause \"talkoff,\" where Asterisk incorrectly\\ndetects DTMF when it should not:\\nrelaxdtmf=yes|no\\n\\nrtautoclear (global)\\n\\nThis specifies whether or not Asterisk should auto-expire friends created on the fly\\non the same schedule as if they had just registered. If set to yes, when the registration expires, the friend will vanish from the configuration until requested again. If\\nset to an integer, friends expire within that number of seconds instead of the normal\\nregistration interval:\\nrtautoclear=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nrtcachefriends (global)\\nIf rtcachefriends is turned on, Asterisk will cache friends that come from the\\n\\nrealtime engine, just as if they had come from sip.conf. This often helps with items\\nsuch as message-waiting indications on realtime peers:\\nrtcachefriends=yes|no\\n\\nrtsavesysname (global)\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should save the systemname in the realtime\\ndatabase at the time of registration:\\nrtsavesysname=yes|no\\n\\nrtupdate (global)\\nIf set to yes Asterisk will update the IP address, origination port, and registration\\nperiod of a peer upon registration. Defaults to yes:\\nrtupdate=yes|no\\n\\nsipdebug\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should turn on SIP debugging from the time that\\nAsterisk loads the SIP channel driver:\\nsipdebug=yes|no\\n\\nsendrpid\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should send a Remote-Party-ID header:\\nsendrpid=yes|no\\n\\nsrvlookup\\n\\nDNS SRV records are a way of setting up a logical, resolvable address where you\\ncan be reached. This allows calls to be forwarded to different locations without the\\nneed to change the logical address. By using SRV records, you gain many of the\\n\\n356 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cadvantages of DNS, whereas disabling them removes the ability to place SIP calls\\nbased on domain names.\\nCurrently, the support for SRV records in Asterisk is somewhat\\nlacking. If multiple SRV records are returned, Asterisk will use only\\nthe first record.\\n\\nUsing DNS SRV record lookups is highly recommended. To enable them, set\\nsrvlookup=yes in the [general] section of sip.conf:\\nsrvlookup=yes\\n\\n\\nThis is the minimum round-trip time for messages to monitored hosts in\\nmilliseconds. Defaults to 100 milliseconds:\\n\\nsubscribecontext\\n\\nLimits SUBSCRIBE requests to the specified context. This is useful if you want to\\nlimit subscriptions to internal extensions, for example.\\nThis option may also be set on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nsubscribecontext=internal\\n\\nSetting t38pt_udptl to yes enables T.38 fax (UDPTL) passthrough on SIP-to-SIP\\n\\ncalls, provided both parties have T.38 support. This setting must be enabled in the\\ngeneral section for all devices to work. You can then disable it on a per-device basis:\\n\\nT.38 fax passthrough works only in SIP-to-SIP calls, without any\\nlocal or agent channel being used. Asterisk cannot currently originate or terminate T.38 fax calls; it can only passthrough UDPTL\\nfrom one device to another.\\n\\ntos_sip, tos_audio, and tos_video\\n\\nAsterisk can set the TOS bits in the IP header to help improve performance on\\nrouters that respect TOS bits in their routing calculations. The tos_sip,\\ntos_audio, and tos_video settings control the TOS bits for the SIP messages, the\\nAF11, AF12, AF13, AF21, AF22, AF23, AF31, AF32, AF33, AF41, AF42, AF43, and ef (expedited forwarding). You may also use a numeric value for the TOS bits.\\nFor more information, see the doc/ip-tos.txt file in the Asterisk source directory.\\n\\nSIP | 357\\n\\x0ctrustrpid\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should trust the value in the Remote-Party-ID\\nheader:\\ntrustrpid=yes|no\\n\\nuseragent\\nuseragent takes as its argument a string specifying the value for the useragent field\\nin the SIP header. The default value is asterisk:\\nuseragent=Asterisk PBX v1.4\\n\\nusereqphone\\nThe usereqphone option tells Asterisk to add ;user=phone to SIP URIs that contain\\n\\na valid phone number:\\nusereqphone\\n\\nvideosupport (both)\\nYou can set videosupport to yes or no. You can turn it off on a per-peer basis if\\n\\ngeneral video support is enabled, but you can\\'t enable it for one peer only without\\nenabling it in the general section:\\nvideosupport=yes|no\\n\\nvmexten\\n\\nThis option sets the dialplan extension to reach the voicemailbox, and will be sent\\nin the Message-Account section of the MWI NOTIFY message. Set this if your SIP\\ndevice supports the Message-Account setting. This option defaults to asterisk:\\n\\nSIP Channel Definitions\\nNow that we\\'ve covered the global SIP parameters, we will discuss the channel-specific\\nparameters. These parameters can be defined for a user, a peer, or both (as noted in\\nparentheses):\\naccountcode (both)\\n\\nThe account code can be defined on a per-user basis. If defined, this account code\\nwill be assigned to a call record whenever no specific user account code is set. The\\naccountcode name configured will be used as the <filename>.csv in\\nthe /var/log/asterisk/cdr-csv/ directory to store CDRs for the user/peer/friend:\\naccountcode=iax-username\\n\\nallow and disallow (both)\\n\\nSpecific codecs can be allowed or disallowed, limiting codec use to those preferred\\nby the system designer. allow and disallow can also be defined on a per-channel\\nbasis. Keep in mind that allow statements in the [general] section will carry over\\nto each of the channels, unless you reset with a disallow=all. Codec negotiation\\n358 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cis attempted in the order in which the codecs are defined. Best practice suggests\\nthat you define disallow=all, followed by explicit allow statements for each codec\\nyou wish to use. If nothing is defined, allow=all is assumed:\\ndisallow=all\\nallow=ulaw\\nallow=gsm\\nallow=ilbc\\n\\namaflags (both)\\n\\nAutomatic Message Accounting (AMA) is defined in the Telcordia Family of Documents listed under FR-AMA-1. These documents specify standard mechanisms for\\ngeneration and transmission of CDRs. You can specify one of four AMA flags\\n(default, omit, billing, or documentation) to apply to all SIP connections:\\namaflags=documentation\\n\\ncallerid (both)\\n\\nYou can set a suggested Caller ID string for a user or peer with callerid. If you\\ndefine a Caller ID field for a user, any calls that come in on that channel will have\\nthat Caller ID assigned to them, regardless of what the far end sends to you. If\\nCaller ID is defined for a peer, you are requesting that the far end use that to identify\\nyou (keep in mind, however, that you have no way to ensure that it will do so). If\\nyou want incoming callers to be able to define their own Caller IDs (i.e., for guests),\\nmake sure you do not set the callerid field:\\n\\ncallgroup and pickupgroup (both)\\nYou can use the callgroup parameter to assign a channel definition to one or more\\ngroups, and you can use the pickupgroup option in conjunction with this parameter\\n\\nto allow a ringing phone to be answered from another extension. The\\npickupgroup option is used to control which callgroups a channel may pick up--a\\nchannel is given authority to answer another ringing channel if it is assigned to the\\nsame pickupgroup as the ringing channel\\'s callgroup. By default, remote ringing\\nextensions can be answered with *8 (this is configurable in the features.conf file):\\n\\ncallingpres (both)\\n\\nSets Caller ID presentation for this user/peer. This setting takes one of the following\\noptions:\\nallowed_not_screened\\n\\nPresentation allowed, not screened\\nallowed_passed_screen\\n\\nPresentation allowed, passed screen\\n\\nSIP | 359\\n\\x0callowed_failed_screen\\n\\nPresentation allowed, failed screen\\nallowed\\n\\nPresentation allowed, network number\\nprohib_not_screened\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, not screened\\nprohib_passed_screen\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, passed screen\\nprohib_failed_screen\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, failed screen\\nprohib\\n\\nPresentation prohibited, network number\\nunavailable\\n\\nNumber unavailable\\n=yes|no\\n\\ncanreinvite (both)\\n\\nThe SIP protocol tries to connect endpoints directly. However, Asterisk must remain in the transmission path between the endpoints if it is required to detect\\nDTMF (for more information, see Chapter 4):\\ncanreinvite=no\\n\\ncontext (both)\\n\\nA context is assigned to a channel definition to direct incoming calls into the\\nmatching context in extensions.conf, where call handling is performed (see Chapters Chapter 4 and Chapter 5). Any channel connecting to an Asterisk machine has\\nto have a context defined into which it will arrive. The context is essential for any\\nuser channel definition; if you do not define a context, incoming calls will be directed to the default context:\\ncontext=incoming\\n\\nYou should be aware of an unusual scenario that will require a\\ncontext definition for a peer. When a call comes through the SIP\\nchannel, it first tries to find a matching user definition (based on\\nthe user name in square brackets and the secret). If it can\\'t find any\\nmatching users, it then looks for matching peers, based on the IP\\naddress that the call is coming from. Since peers don\\'t normally\\nhave contexts, this will cause such a call to arrive in the default\\ncontext. While this will work, the default context shouldn\\'t really\\nbe used to handle incoming calls. The solution is to define a context, on a per-peer basis, for any peers that might match on\\nincoming calls. To experiment with this, you can call your Free\\nWorld Dialup number; the call will come right back to you.\\n\\n360 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cdefaultip (peer)\\nThe defaultip setting complements host=dynamic. If a host has not yet registered\\n\\nwith your server, you\\'ll attempt to send messages to the default IP address configured here:\\n\\ndeny (both)\\n\\nSpecific IP addresses and ranges can be controlled with the deny option. To restrict\\naccess from a range of IP addresses, use a subnet mask--for example,\\ndeny=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0. You can also deny all addresses with\\ndeny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and then allow only certain addresses with the permit command. Be aware of the security implications of this setting (see also permit):\\n\\ndisallow (both)\\nSee allow.\\ndtmfmode (both)\\n\\nYou can set dtmfmode to inband, rfc2833, or info. DTMF digits can be sent either\\nin band (as part of the audio stream), or out of band (as signaling information),\\nusing the RFC 2833 or INFO methods. The inband method works reliably only\\nwhen using an uncompressed codec such as G.711, law, or alaw. The recommended method is to use rfc2833; however, some devices--such as those by\\nGrandstream--support the info method:\\n\\nIn Asterisk 1.4, Variable Length DTMF was introduced in order to\\nallow Asterisk to correctly signal to the far end the duration of a\\nkey press on the phone connected to the incoming channel (per\\nIETF RFC 2833). Older Asterisk systems do not understand the\\nvariable-length parameter. In older Asterisk systems, DTMF delivered via RFC 2833 may not be correctly interpreted, leading to\\nstrange effects in sessions such as voicemail. If you want to have\\nthe older (pre-1.4) behaviour of the rfc2833 setting, you must add\\nthe rfc2833compensate=yes option to the peer in sip.conf that defines communication with your pre-1.4 Asterisk system.\\n\\nfromdomain (peer)\\n\\nThis allows you to set the domain in the From: field of the SIP header. It may be\\nrequired by some providers for authentication:\\nfromdomain=my.hostname.tld\\n\\nfromuser (peer)\\n\\nThis allows you to set the username with which to authenticate. The name contained within the square brackets of the channel definition is usually used, but this\\nSIP | 361\\n\\x0ccan be overridden with the fromuser option. This allows a channel definition to be\\nreferenced with a name other than that used to authenticate:\\nfromuser=john_smith\\n\\nhost (peer)\\n\\nThis configures the host to which this peer is to connect. Use a fully qualified\\ndomain name:\\nhost=remote.hostname.tld\\n\\nincominglimit (both)\\n\\nThis option limits the total number of simultaneous calls for a peer or user. It sets\\nthe max number of simultaneous outgoing calls for a peer, or the max number of\\nincoming calls for a user.\\n\\ninsecure (both)\\nWhen an INVITE is received from a remote location, Asterisk attempts to authenticate the string of characters before the @ sign on the INVITE line received in the\\n\\nSIP header with the name of a channel definition in sip.conf. If the remote end is a\\nuser agent, it will authenticate based on a user definition. However, if the remote\\nend is a SIP proxy service, it will authenticate on the peer entry. When calls come\\nfrom a provider such as Free World Dialup, which acts as a proxy for the true\\nremote end who is calling you, that provider cannot authenticate the call on behalf\\nof the endpoint. Since it would be impractical to have an authentication configured\\nfor every FWD user, and since FWD cannot respond to a 407 Proxy Authentication\\nRequired response, there must be an alternate way to allow calls from these callers.\\nIf you set insecure=invite, you\\'ll determine which peer to match on by comparing\\nthe IP address or hostname and port number to those provided in the Contact field\\nof the SIP header with the host and port options in sip.conf. If a match is found,\\nauthentication will not be required on the initial INVITE, and the call will be allowed.\\nIf you have multiple endpoints behind a NAT device, you need to enable inse\\ncure=port to match against only the IP address. To not require authentication on\\nthe incoming INVITE for the peer, set insecure=invite,port:\\ninsecure=invite\\n\\nlanguage (both)\\n\\nThis sets the language flag to whatever you define. The global default language is\\nEnglish. The language that is set is sent by the channel as an information element.\\nIt is also used by applications such as SayNumber() that have different files for different languages. Keep in mind that languages other than English are not explicitly\\ninstalled on the system, and it is up to you to configure the system to ensure that\\nthe language you specify is handled properly:\\n\\n362 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0clanguage=en\\n\\nmailbox (peer)\\n\\nIf you associate a mailbox with a peer within the channel definition, voicemail will\\nsend a MWI to the nodes on the end of that channel. If the mailbox number is in\\na voicemail context other than default, you can specify it as mailbox @ context. To\\nassociate multiple mailboxes with a single peer, use multiple mailbox statements:\\n\\nmaxcallbitrate (both)\\n\\nSets the maximum bitrate for an individual call from this user or to this peer. Defaults to 384 Kb/s:\\n\\n\\nIf you do not wish to have plain-text secrets in your sip.conf files, you can use\\nmd5secret to configure the MD5 hash that can be used for authentication. To gen-\\n\\nerate the MD5 hash from the Linux console, use the following command:\\n# echo -n \"username:realm:secret\" | md5sum\\n\\nBe sure to use the -n flag, or echo will add a \\\\n to the end of the string; the line feed\\nwill then be calculated into the MD5 hash, creating the incorrect hash. The\\nrealm, if not specified with the realm option (discussed in the list of general SIP\\nparameters), defaults to asterisk. If both an md5secret and a secret are specified\\nin the same channel definition, the secret will be ignored:\\n\\nmohinterpret (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies a preference for which MoH class this channel should listen\\nto when put on hold if the music class has not been set on the channel with Set\\n(CHANNEL(musicclass)=whatever) in the dialplan, and the peer channel putting this\\none on hold did not suggest a music class.\\nThis option may be specified globally, or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohinterpret=default\\n\\nmohsuggest (channel)\\n\\nThis option specifies which music-on-hold class (as defined in musiconhold.conf)\\nto suggest to the peer channel when this channel places the peer on hold. It may\\nbe specified globally or on a per-user or per-peer basis:\\nmohsuggest=default\\n\\nmusicclass (both)\\n\\nThis option sets the default music-on-hold class:\\nmusicclass=classical\\n\\nSIP | 363\\n\\x0cnat (both)\\n\\nYou can set nat to yes, no, or never. If you set it to yes, Asterisk ignores the IP\\naddress in the SIP and SDP headers and responds to the address and port in the IP\\nheader. The never option is for devices that cannot handle rport in the SIP header,\\nsuch as the Uniden UIP200:\\nnat=yes|no|never\\n\\npermit (both)\\nSee deny.\\npickupgroup (both)\\nSee callgroup.\\nport (peer)\\n\\nYou can use this to define the port on which to listen for SIP signaling, if you want\\nto listen on a nonstandard port. (The default port for SIP signaling is 5060.)\\n\\nprogressinband (both)\\nYou can set progressinband to yes, no, or never, to configure whether or not to\\n\\ngenerate in-band ringing. Normally, Asterisk will send the progress of a call via a\\nfew methods, such as 183 Session Progress, 180 Ringing, 486 Busy, and so on. If\\nyou set progressinband=yes, Asterisk will indicate the call progress in band by generating tones:\\nprogressinband=yes|no|never\\n\\npromiscredir (both)\\nYou can set promiscredir to yes or no. Normally, when you perform call forwarding\\non a phone, Asterisk will use the Local channel (for example, local/\\n18005551212@peer). If you set promiscredir=yes, Asterisk will use the SIP channel\\n\\ninstead, which enables you to forward the calls to remote boxes:\\npromiscredir=yes|no\\n\\nNote that if Asterisk performs a redirect to itself when promiscre\\ndir=yes, the system will receive an INVITE with the same Caller ID\\nand detect a loop to itself. SIP does not have the ability to perform\\na hairpin call, so the channel will then be destroyed.\\n\\nqualify (peer)\\n\\nYou can set qualify to yes, no, or a time in milliseconds. If you set qualify=yes,\\nNOTIFY messages will be sent periodically to the remote peers to determine whether\\nthey are available and what the latency between replies is. A peer is determined\\nunreachable if no reply is received within 2,000 ms (to change this default, instead\\nset qualify to the number of milliseconds to wait for the reply). Use this option in\\nconjunction with nat=yes to keep the path through the NAT device alive:\\n\\n364 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cqualify=yes|no|seconds\\n\\nregcontext (peer)\\n\\nBy specifying the context that contains the actions to perform, you can configure\\nAsterisk to perform a number of actions when a peer registers to your server. This\\noption works in conjunction with regexten by specifying the extension to execute.\\nIf no regexten is configured, the peer name is used as the extension. Asterisk will\\ndynamically create and destroy a NoOp at priority 1 for the extension. All actions to\\nbe performed upon registration should start at priority 2. More than one\\nregexten may be supplied, if separated by an &. regcontext can be set on a per-peer\\nbasis or globally:\\nregcontext=peer_registrations\\n\\nregexten (peer)\\nThe regexten option is used in conjunction with regcontext to specify the extension\\nthat is executed within the configured context. If regexten is not explicitly config-\\n\\nured, the peer name is used as the extension to match:\\n\\nrtpholdtimeout (peer)\\n\\nThis takes as its argument an integer, specified in seconds. It terminates a call if no\\nRTP data is received while on hold within the time specified. The value of rtphold\\ntimeout must be greater than that of rtptimeout (see also rtptimeout):\\n\\nrtpkeepalive (peer)\\n\\nSpecifies how often Asterisk should send keepalives in the RTP stream, in seconds.\\nDefaults to zero, which means Asterisk won\\'t send any RTP keepalives:\\n\\nrtptimeout (peer)\\n\\nThis takes as its argument an integer, specified in seconds. It terminates a call if no\\nRTP data is received within the time specified:\\n\\nsecret (both)\\n\\nThis sets the password to use for authentication:\\nsecret=welcome\\n\\nsetvar (both)\\n\\nThis sets a channel variable, which will be available when a channel to the peer or\\nuser is created and will be destroyed when the call is hung up. For example, to set\\nthe channel variable foo with a value of bar, use:\\nsetvar=foo=bar\\n\\nSIP | 365\\n\\x0cusername (peer)\\nThe username field allows you to attempt contact with a peer before it has registered\\n\\nwith you. At registration, a SIP device tells Asterisk which SIP URI to use to contact\\nit. The username is used in conjunction with defaultip to create the SIP URI in the\\nSIP INVITE header. This might be useful following a reboot, in order to place a call.\\nThe endpoints will not attempt to register with the server until their registration\\ntimeouts expire, so you will not know their locations. For nondynamic hosts, you\\nwill require the username to be specified, as it is used to construct the authorization username:\\nusername=john_smith\\n\\n366 | Appendix A: VoIP Channels\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX B\\n\\nApplication Reference\\n\\nApplications are the core functionality of the dialplan. Generally these all will operate\\non the channel, whereas functions, described in Appendix F, merely return values that\\ncan be used by applications. There are a few applications that still simply return values,\\nbut these will probably be deprecated in a future version and replaced with dialplan\\nfunctions.\\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about applications. First, when they exit, they\\nwill either terminate normally or abnormally. Abnormal termination almost always\\noccurs when an application detects that the channel has hung up (or if it doesn\\'t, the\\ndialplan will detect that shortly thereafter). An application may also exit abnormally\\nwhen it wishes to indicate to the dialplan that some condition has not been satisfied\\nand that it should force a hangup. In all other cases, an application will exit normally,\\nwhich indicates that processing should continue at the next priority in the dialplan.\\nIn many cases, if you wish to override the application\\'s wish to cause a hangup, you\\nmay wrap the application in a TryExec().\\nIn many places throughout this reference, you will see what\\'s described as a label. This\\nis shorthand for describing a location in the dialplan, whether it is simply a priority;\\nan extension and a priority; or a context, an extension, and a priority. Note that if a\\ntext label is defined for a particular priority, the priority may be replaced with that\\ntext label in any of those cases. See the GotoIf() application for more information\\nand an example.\\nYou will find many of the examples in this appendix to contain numbered priorities, which is not the preferred method of writing dialplans.\\nWe prefer the use of the \\'n\\' priority for all priority numbers except 1\\n(which is required), but we have decided to utilize them in order to make\\nsome of the examples more clear.\\n\\nAddQueueMember()\\n\\nDynamically adds queue members to the specified call queue\\n\\nAddQueueMember(queuename[,interface[,penalty,[option,[membername]]]])\\n\\n\\x0cDynamically adds the specified interface to an existing queue named queuename, as\\nspecified in queues.conf. If specified, penalty sets the penalty for queues to use this\\nmember. Members with a lower penalty are called before members with a higher\\npenalty.\\nThe AddQueueMember() application sets a channel variable named AQMSTATUS upon completion. The AQMSTATUS variable will be set to one of the following values:\\nADDED\\nMEMBERALREADY\\nNOSUCHQUEUE\\n\\nCalling AddQueueMember() without an interface argument will use the interface that the\\ncaller is currently using.\\nIf the option argument is set to j, Asterisk cannot add the interface to the specified\\nqueue, and there exists an n+101 priority (where n is the number of the current priority),\\nthe call will jump to that priority.\\nThe membername argument may be set to the name of the queue member. Consequently,\\nthis name will show up in the entries of the queue_log as well as Asterisk Manager\\nInterface events, making it easier to identify the agent for reporting purposes:\\n; add SIP/3000 to the techsupport queue, with a penalty of 1\\nexten => 123,1,AddQueueMember(techsupport,SIP/3000,1)\\n\\nSee Also\\nQueue(), RemoveQueueMember(), PauseQueueMember(), UnpauseQueueMember(), AgentLogin\\n() , queues.conf\\n\\nADSIProg()\\n\\nLoads an ADSI script into an ADSI-capable phone\\n\\nADSIProg(script)\\n\\nPrograms an Analog Display Services Interface (ADSI) phone with the given script.

As such, it should be used only in conjunction with (and after!) the AgentCallbackLogin() application. It uses the monitoring\\nfunctions in the chan_agent module instead of the Monitor() application to record the\\ncalls. This means that call recording must be configured correctly in the agents.conf file.\\nBy default, recorded calls are saved to the /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/ directory.

AGI\\nprograms allow external programs (written in almost any language) to control the telephony channel by playing audio, reading DTMF digits, and so on. Asterisk communicates with the AGI program on STDIN and STDOUT. The specified arguments are passed\\nto the AGI program.\\n\\n370 | Appendix B: Application Reference\\n\\x0cThe program must be set as executable in the underlying filesystem. The program path\\nis relative to the Asterisk AGI directory, which by default is /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/.\\nIf you want to run an AGI when no channel exists (such as in an h extension), use the\\nDeadAGI() application instead. You may want to use the FastAGI() application if you\\nwant to do AGI processing across the network.\\nIf you want access to the inbound audio stream from within your AGI program, use\\nEAGI() instead of AGI(). Inbound audio can then be read in on file descriptor 3.\\nIf the channel hangs up prematurely, the process initiated by the AGI command will be\\nsent a HUP signal to tell it that the channel has hung up. If your program does not catch\\nthis signal, it will be terminated.

For example, a SIP channel will\\nneed a network address and user to connect to, whereas a Zap channel is going to want\\nsome sort of phone number.\\nWhen you specify a channel type that is network-based, you can pass the destination\\nhost (name or IP address), username, password, and remote extension as part of the\\n* The fact that Asterisk will happily connect IAX, SIP, H.323, Skinny, PRI, FX(O/S), and anything else is\\n\\namazing, but possibly the most amazing of all is the Local channel. By allowing a single Dial() command to\\nconnect to multiple Local channels, one Dial() event can trigger a multitude of completely independent and\\nunique actions in other parts of the dialplan. The power of this concept is truly revolutionary and has to be\\nexperienced to be believed.\\n\\n382 | Appendix B: Application Reference\\n\\x0coptions to Dial(), or you can refer to the name of a channel entry in the appropriate .conf file; all the required information will then need to be obtained from that file.\\nThe username and password can be replaced with the name contained within square\\nbrackets ([]) of the channel configuration file.

The extension is not required by Dial(), as the information in the\\nremote end\\'s channel configuration file may be used, or the remote server will pass the\\ncall to the s extension in the context in which the call came in. Ultimately, the far end\\ncontrols what happens to the call; you can only request a specific treatment.\\nIf no ring-timeout is specified, the channel will ring indefinitely. This is not always a\\nbad thing, so don\\'t feel you need to set it; just be aware that \"indefinitely\" could mean\\na very long time. ring-timeout is specified in seconds. The ring timeout always follows\\nthe addressing information, like this:\\nexten => s,1,Dial(IAX2/user:pass@otherend.com/500,ring-timeout)\\n\\nMuch of the power of the Dial() application is in the flags. These are assigned following\\nthe addressing and timeout information, like this:\\nexten => s,1,Dial(IAX2/user:pass@otherend.com/500,60,flags)\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have a timeout specified, and you want to assign flags, you\\nmust still assign a spot for the timeout. You do this by adding an extra\\ncomma in the spot where the timeout would normally go, like this:\\nexten => s,1,Dial(IAX2/user:pass@otherend.com/500,,flags)\\n\\nThe valid flags that may be used with the Dial() application are:\\nA( x )\\n\\nPlays an announcement to the called party; x is the filename of the sound file to\\nplay as the announcement.\\n\\nDial() | 383\\n\\x0cC\\n\\nResets the Call Detail Record for the call.

This application is often used\\nas a debugging tool. Whenever Asterisk\\'s core verbosity level is set to 3 or above, Asterisk evaluates and prints each line of the dialplan before executing it. This means that\\nany arguments passed to the NoOp() application (in the text parameter) are printed to\\nthe console. By watching the console output, a skilled Asterisk administrator can use\\nthis output to debug problems in the dialplan.\\nexten => 123,1,NoOp(CallerID is ${CALLERID})\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to place quotes around the text. If quotes are placed\\nwithin the brackets, they will show up on the console.\\n\\nWhen to use NoOp() and Verbose()\\nThe difference between Verbose() and NoOp() is subtle. Here are some suggestions as\\nto how you can discern when to use each. The Verbose() application is handy when\\nyou want to output something to the console. Using the set verbose command (followed by the level of verbosity you desire--0 to 4), you can set the output to a level\\nthat will not show you all of the activity on the system, but rather only those things\\nthat are equal to or less than that the current level. (Actually, you can set the verbosity\\nto whatever you want. The set verbose 999 will work just fine, but we have not been\\nable to find anything that outputs at a level higher than 4, so anything from 4 to infinity\\nwill be effectively the same for the time being.) This means that you can display all\\n\\nNoCDR() | 415\\n\\x0ckinds of information pertaining to a section of code you are testing, without having to\\nsee all of the other activity in the system. If you set the following in your dial plan:\\nexten => _X.,n,Verbose(2, ${SOME_VAR})\\n\\nYou can then use the CLI to set the verbosity to 2 or less (core set verbose 2), and you\\nwill see output from the various calls to Verbose(), but very little else.\\nRead the section on Verbose() later in this appendix for more on how to use it. The\\nNoOp() application is best used as a place holder. For example, if you are setting a\\nGoto() point in your dialplan that is using a priority label, you can use NoOp() as the\\ndestination point for that goto. For example,\\nexten => _X.,n(call_forward),NoOp()\\n\\nis an excellent marker for pointing a jump in your dialplan to a spot. From that point\\nyou can carry on with whatever logic you wanted to apply to that part of the extension\\n(judging by the label, it\\'d have something to do with call forwarding). The value of the\\nNoOp() is that when you don\\'t really know what sort of things you might want to move\\naround in relation to what follows that label, you can be sure you\\'ll never have to recode\\nthe label itself. It will never do anything other than provide a destination for the\\nGoto(), so you can put it wherever you like and be sure it won\\'t introduce any unexpected behavior.\\nIf this seems confusing, it is due to our inability to describe it right. Experiment with\\nVerbose() and NoOp() all in your dialplan (you can use them anywhere), and you will\\nquickly gain an understanding of how they can help you (especially if you are like us\\nand cause a lot of syntax errors).\\n\\nSee Also\\nVerbose(), Log()\\n\\nPage()\\n\\nOpens one-way audio to multiple phones\\n\\n\\nPlaces outbound calls to the given technology/resource and dumps them in to a conference bridge as muted participants.

If you are looking for VoIP channel configurations, refer to Appendix A. For a dialplan reference, you\\'ll want to\\nuse Appendix B.\\n\\nA configuration file is required for each Asterisk module you wish to use. These .conf\\nfiles contain channel definitions, describe internal services, define the locations of other\\nmodules, or relate to the dialplan. You do not need to configure all of them to have a\\nfunctioning system, only the ones required for your configuration. Although Asterisk\\nships with samples of all of the configuration files, it is possible to start Asterisk without\\nany of them. This will not provide you with a working system, but it clearly demonstrates the modularity of the platform.\\nIf no .conf files are found, Asterisk will make some decisions with respect to modules.\\nFor example, the following steps are always taken:\\n The Asterisk Event Logger is loaded, and events are logged\\nto /var/log/asterisk/event_log.\\n Manager actions are registered.\\n The PBX core is initialized.\\n The RTP port range is allocated from 5,000 through 31,000.\\n Several built-in applications are loaded, such as Answer(), Background(), GotoIf(),\\nNoOp(), and Set().\\n The dynamic loader is started; this is the engine responsible for loading modules\\ndefined in modules.conf.\\nThis appendix starts with an in-depth look at the modules.conf configuration file. We\\'ll\\nthen briefly examine all the other files that you may need to configure for your Asterisk\\nsystem.\\n\\n\\x0cmodules.conf\\nThe modules.conf file controls which modules are loaded or not loaded at Asterisk\\nstartup. This is done through the use of the load => or noload => constructs.\\nThis file is a key component to building a secure Asterisk installation:\\nbest practice suggests that only required modules be loaded.\\n\\nThe modules.conf file always starts with the [modules] header. The autoload statement\\ntells Asterisk whether to automatically load all modules contained within the modules\\ndirectory or to load only those modules specifically defined by load => statements. We\\nrecommend you manually load only those modules you need, but many people find it\\neasier to let Asterisk attempt to autoload whatever it finds in /usr/lib/asterisk/modules.\\nYou can then exclude* certain modules with noload => statements.\\nHere\\'s a sample modules.conf file:\\n[modules]\\nautoload=no\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\nload\\n\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n=>\\n\\nres_adsi.so\\npbx_config.so\\nchan_sip.so\\ncodec_alaw.so\\ncodec_gsm.so\\ncodec_ulaw.so\\nformat_gsm.so\\napp_dial.so\\n\\n; set this to yes and Asterisk will load any\\n; modules it finds in /usr/lib/asterisk/modules\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\nRequires:\\n\\nN/A\\nres_crypto.so, res_features.so\\nres_features.so\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nres_features.so, res_musiconhold.so\\n\\nSince we assume Asterisk is built on Linux, all the module names we use end in a .so\\nextension. However, this may not be the case if you have built Asterisk on a different\\noperating system.\\nAs of this writing, there are eight module types: resources, applications,\\nCall Detail Record database connectors, channels, codecs, formats, PBX modules, and\\nstandalone functions. Let\\'s take a look at each of them.\\n\\nadsi.conf\\nThe Analog Display Services Interface (ADSI) was designed to allow telephone companies to deliver enhanced services across analog telephone circuits. In Asterisk, you\\n* With the advent of the new menuselect system, this best practice may no longer be necessary if you are\\n\\nbuilding only the modules you need in the first place\\n\\n462 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ccan use this file to send ADSI commands to compatible telephones. Please note that\\nthe phone must be directly connected to a Zapata channel. ADSI messages cannot be\\nsent across a VoIP connection to a remote analog phone.\\nThe res_adsi.so module is required for the Voicemail() application; however, the\\nadsi.conf file is not necessarily used. Detailed information about ADSI is not publicly\\navailable, and documentation needs to be purchased from Telcordia.\\n\\nadtranvofr.conf\\nPrior to Voice over IP, Voice over Frame Relay (VoFR) enjoyed brief fame as a means\\nof carrying packetized voice. Supporting VoFR through Adtran equipment is part of\\nthe history of Asterisk.\\nThis feature is no longer popular in the community, though, so it may be difficult to\\nfind support for it.\\n\\nagents.conf\\nThis file allows you to create and manage agents for your call center. If you are using\\nthe Queue() application, you may want to configure agents for the queue. The\\nagents.conf file is used to configure the AGENT channel driver.\\nThe [general] section in agents.conf currently contains only two parameters. The\\npersistentagents parameter tells Asterisk whether or not to save the status of agents\\nwho use the callback feature of queues in the local Asterisk database. If set to yes, a\\nlogged-in remote agent will then remain logged in across a reboot (unless removed from\\nthe database through some other means). The multiplelogin parameter tells Asterisk\\nwhether or not multiple agents can log in from the same extension.\\nThe following parameters, which are specified in the [agents] section, are used to define\\nagents and the way the system interacts with them. The settings apply to all agents,\\nunless otherwise specified in the individual agent definitions:\\nmaxlogintries\\n\\nThe maximum number of times an agent may attempt to log in. Defaults to 3.\\nautologoff\\n\\nAccepts an argument (in seconds) defining how long an agent channel should ring\\nfor before the agent is deemed unavailable and logged off.\\nautologoffunavail\\nDefine autologoffunavail to have agents automatically logged out when the Dial\\n() application returns a CHANUNAVAIL status while trying to dial that agent. Default\\n\\nis \"no\".\\n\\nadtranvofr.conf | 463\\n\\x0cackcall\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. If set to yes, requires a callback agent to acknowledge log in by pressing the # key after logging in. This works in conjunction\\nwith the AgentCallbackLogin() application.\\nendcall\\n\\nIf set to yes, allows an agent to hang up a call by pressing the * key. Defaults to\\nyes. Set this to no to have Asterisk do nothing when the agent presses the * key.\\nwrapuptime\\n\\nYou can configure this parameter to allow agents a few seconds of downtime after\\ncompleting a call before the queue presents them with another call. This setting is\\nmeasured in milliseconds.\\nmusiconhold => class\\n\\nAccepts a music-on-hold class as its argument. This setting applies to all agents.\\nagentgoodbye\\n\\nDefines the default goodbye sound for agents.\\nupdatecdr\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Used to define whether the source channel in\\nthe CDRs should be set to agent/agent_id to determine which agent generated the\\ncalls.\\ngroup\\n\\nDefines the groups to which an agent belongs, specified with integers. Specify that\\nan agent belongs to multiple groups by separating the integers with commas.\\nrecordagentcalls\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Defines whether or not agent calls should be\\nrecorded.\\nrecordformat\\n\\nDefines the format to record files in. The argument specified should be wav, gsm,\\nor wav49. The default recording format is wav.\\nurlprefix\\n\\nAccepts a string as its argument. The string can be formed as a URL and is appended\\nto the start of the text to be added to the name of the recording.\\nsavecallsin\\n\\nAccepts a filesystem path as its argument. Allows you to override the default path\\nof /var/spool/asterisk/monitor/ with one of your choosing.\\nSince the storage of calls will require a large amount of hard drive\\nspace, you will want to define a strategy to handle storing and\\nmanaging these recordings.\\nThis location should probably reside on a separate volume, one\\nwith very high performance characteristics.\\n\\n464 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ccustom_beep\\n\\nAccepts a filename as its argument. Can be used to define a custom notification\\ntone to signal to an always-connected agent that there is an incoming call.\\nThe final parameter is used to define agents. Just like in the zapata.conf file, configuration parameters are inherited from above the agent => definition. Agents are defined\\nwith the following format:\\nagent => agent_id,agent_password,name\\n\\nFor example, we can define agent Happy Tempura with the agent ID 1000 and password 1234, as follows.\\nagent => 1000,1234,Happy Tempura\\n\\nBe aware that an agents.conf file is a complement to the queue configuration process.\\nThe most critical configuration file for your queues is queues.conf. You can configure\\na very basic queue without agents.conf.\\n\\nalarmreceiver.conf\\nThe AlarmReceiver() application is not approved by Underwriter\\'s Laboratory (UL) and should not be used as the primary or sole means of\\nreceiving alarm messages or events. This application is not guaranteed\\nto be reliable, so don\\'t depend on it unless you have extensively tested\\nit. Use of this application without extensive testing may place your life\\nand/or property at risk.\\n\\nThe alarmreceiver.conf file is used by the AlarmReceiver() application, which allows\\nAsterisk to accept alarms using the SIA (Ademco) Contact ID protocol. When a call is\\nreceived from an alarm panel, it should be directed to a context that calls the AlarmRe\\nceiver() application. In turn, AlarmReceiver() will read the alarmreceiver.conf configuration file and perform the configured actions as required. All parameters are specified\\nunder the [general] heading.\\nThe sample configuration file will contain the current settings for this application and\\nis very well documented.\\n\\nalsa.conf\\nThe alsa.conf file is used to configure Asterisk to use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) to provide access to a sound card, if desired. You can use this file to\\nconfigure the CONSOLE channel, which is most commonly used to create an overhead\\npaging system (although, as with any other channel, there are all kinds of creative ways\\nthis can be used). Keep in mind that the usefulness of the ALSA channel by itself is\\nlimited due to its lack of a user interface.\\n\\nalarmreceiver.conf | 465\\n\\x0camd.conf\\nThis is the configuration for the answering matching detection application in Asterisk,\\ncalled AMD(). It is used to adjust the different parameters for detecting an answering\\nmachine based on items such as initial silence, greeting length, silence after the greeting,\\nand so forth.\\n\\nasterisk.conf\\nThe asterisk.conf file defines the locations for the configuration files, the spool directory, and the modules, as well as a location to write logfiles to. The default settings are\\nrecommended unless you understand the implications of changing them. The\\nasterisk.conf file is generated automatically when you run the make samples command,\\nbased on information it collects about your system. It will contain a [directories]\\nsection such as the following:\\n[directories]\\nastetcdir => /etc/asterisk\\nastmoddir => /usr/lib/asterisk/modules\\nastvarlibdir => /var/lib/asterisk\\nastdatadir => /var/lib/asterisk\\nastagidir => /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin\\nastspooldir => /var/spool/asterisk\\nastrundir => /var/run\\nastlogdir => /var/log/asterisk\\n\\nAdditionally, you can specify an [options] section, which will allow you to define\\nstartup options (command-line switches) in the configuration file. The following example shows the available options and the command-line switches that they effectively\\nenforce:\\n[options]\\n;Under \"options\" you can enter configuration options\\n;that you also can set with command line options\\nverbose = 0\\ndebug = 3\\nnofork=yes | no\\nalwaysfork=yes | no\\nconsole= yes | no\\nhighpriority = yes | no\\ninitcrypto = yes | no\\nnocolor = yes | no\\ndumpcore = yes | no\\nquiet = yes | no\\ntimestamp = yes | no\\n\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n;\\n\\nVerbosity level for logging (-v)\\nDebug: \"No\" or value (1-4)\\nBackground execution disabled (-f)\\nAlways background, even with -v or -d (-F)\\nConsole mode (-c)\\nExecute with high priority (-p)\\nInitialize crypto at startup (-i)\\nDisable ANSI colors (-n)\\nDump core on failure (-g)\\nRun quietly (-q)\\nForce timestamping in CLI verbose output (-T)\\n\\n Yes, we are aware that the user interface to the channel interface is the Asterisk CLI; however, this is not\\n\\nusable as a telephone and therefore does not meet the criteria of an interface from the perspective of a\\ntelephone user.\\n\\n466 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0crunuser = asterisk\\n\\n; User to run asterisk as (-U) NOTE: will require changes to\\n; directory and device permissions\\nrungroup = asterisk\\n; Group to run asterisk as (-G)\\ninternal_timing = yes | no ; Enable internal timing support (-I)\\n; These options have no command line equivalent\\ncache_record_files = yes | no\\n; Cache record() files in another directory until\\n; completion\\nrecord_cache_dir = <dir>\\ntranscode_via_sln = yes | no\\n; Build transcode paths via SLINEAR\\ntransmit_silence_during_record = yes | no ; send SLINEAR silence while channel is\\n; being recorded\\nmaxload = 1.0\\n; The maximum load average we accept calls for\\nmaxcalls = 255\\n; The maximum number of concurrent calls you want\\n; to allow\\nexecincludes = yes | no\\n; Allow #exec entries in configuration files\\ndontwarn = yes | no\\n; Don\\'t over-inform the Asterisk sysadm, he\\'s a guru\\nsystemname = <a_string>\\n; System name.

The cdr.conf file contains some general parameters that\\nare not specific to any particular database, but rather indicate how Asterisk should\\nhandle the passing of information to the database. All options are under the\\n[general] heading of the cdr.conf file:\\nenable\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Specifies whether or not to use CDR logging. If\\nset to no, this will override any CDR module explicitly loaded. The default is yes.\\nbatch\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Allows Asterisk to write data to a buffer instead\\nof writing to the database at the end of every call, to reduce load on the system.\\nNote that if the system dies unexpectedly when this option is set\\nto yes, data loss may occur.\\n\\ncdr.conf | 467\\n\\x0csize\\n\\nSets the maximum number of CDRs to accumulate in the buffer before posting to\\nthe backend CDR storage systems. This setting only takes effect if the batch setting\\nis set to yes. This setting defaults to 100 records.\\ntime\\n\\nAccepts an integer (in seconds) as its argument. Sets the number of seconds before\\nAsterisk flushes the buffer and writes the CDRs to the database, regardless of the\\nnumber of records in the buffer (as defined by size). The default is 300 seconds (5\\nminutes).\\nscheduleronly\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. If you are generating a massive volume of CDRs\\non a system that is pushing them to a remote database, setting scheduleronly to\\nyes may be of benefit. Since the scheduler cannot start a new task until the current\\none is finished, slow CDR writes may adversely affect other processes needing the\\nscheduler. This setting will instruct Asterisk to handle CDR writes in a new thread,\\nessentially assigning a dedicated scheduler to this function. In normal operation,\\nthis would yield very little benefit.\\nsafeshutdown\\n\\nAccepts the arguments yes and no. Setting safeshutdown to yes will prevent Asterisk\\nfrom shutting down completely until the buffer is flushed and all information is\\nwritten to the database. If this parameter is set to no and you shut down Asterisk\\nwith information still residing in the buffers, that information will likely be lost.\\nendbeforehexten\\n\\nNormally, CDR records are not closed out until after all extensions are finished\\nexecuting. By enabling this option, the CDR will be ended before executing the h\\nextension so that CDR values such as end and billsec may be retrieved inside of\\nthis extension. Defaults to no.\\nThe rest of cdr.conf contains setup for several of the backend CDR engines. See the\\nsample cdr.conf for more information.\\n\\ncdr_manager.conf\\nThe cdr_manager.conf file simply contains a [general] heading and a single option,\\nenabled, which you can use to specify whether or not the Asterisk Manager API generates CDR events. If you want CDR events to be generated, you will need the following\\nlines in your cdr_manager.conf file:\\n[general]\\nenabled=yes\\n\\nThe Manager API will then output CDR events containing the following fields:\\nEvent: Cdr\\nAccountCode:\\n\\n468 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cSource:\\nDestination:\\nDestinationContext:\\nCallerID:\\nChannel:\\nDestinationChannel:\\nLastApplication:\\nLastData:\\nStartTime:\\nAnswerTime:\\nEndTime:\\nDuration:\\nBillableSeconds:\\nDisposition:\\nAMAFlags:\\nUniqueID:\\nUserField:\\n\\ncdr_odbc.conf\\nAsterisk can store CDR data in a local or remote database via the ODBC interface. The\\ncdr_odbc.conf file contains the information Asterisk needs to connect to the database.\\nThe cdr_odbc.so module will attempt to load the cdr_odbc.conf file, and if information\\nis found for connecting to a database, the CDR data will be recorded there.\\nIf you are going to use a database for storing CDR data, you will have\\nto select one of the many that are available. Asterisk does not like having\\nmultiple CDR databases to connect to, so do not have extra\\ncdr_engine.conf files hanging about your Asterisk configuration\\ndirectory.\\n\\ncdr_pgsql.conf\\nAsterisk can store CDR data in a PostgreSQL database via the cdr_pgsql.so module.\\nWhen the module is loaded the necessary information will be read from the\\ncdr_pgsql.conf file, and Asterisk will connect to the PostgreSQL database to write and\\nstore CDR data.\\n\\ncdr_tds.conf\\nAsterisk can also store CDR data to a FreeTDS database (including MS SQL) with the\\nuse of the cdr_tds.so module. The configuration file cdr_tds.conf is read once the module\\nis loaded. Upon a successful connection, CDR data will be written to the database.\\n\\ncdr_odbc.conf | 469\\n\\x0ccodecs.conf\\nMost codecs do not have any configurable parameters; they are what they are, and\\nthat\\'s all they are.\\nSome codecs, however, are capable of behaving in different ways. This primarily means\\nthat they can be optimized for a particular goal, such as cutting down on latency, making best use of a network, or perhaps delivering high quality audio.\\nThe codecs.conf file is fairly new in Asterisk, and as of this writing it allows configuration\\nof Speex parameters only. The settings are self-explanatory, as long as you are familiar\\nwith the Speex protocol (see http://www.speex.org).\\ncodecs.conf also allows you to configure Packet Loss Concealment (PLC). You need to\\ndefine a [plc] section and indicate genericplc => true. This will cause Asterisk to\\nattempt to interpolate any packets that are missed. (Enabling this functionality will\\nincur a small performance penalty.)\\n\\ndnsmgr.conf\\nThis file is used to configure whether Asterisk should perform DNS lookups on a regular\\nbasis, and how often those lookups should be performed.\\n\\ndundi.conf\\nThe DUNDi protocol is used to dynamically look up the VoIP address of a phone\\nnumber on a network, and to connect to that address. Unlike the ENUM standard,\\nDUNDi has no central authority. The dundi.conf file contains DUNDi extensions used\\nto control what is advertised; it also contains the peers to whom you will submit lookup\\nrequests and from whom you will accept lookup requests. The DUNDi protocol was\\nexplored in Chapter 14.\\n\\nenum.conf\\nThe Electronic Numbering (ENUM) system is used in conjunction with the Internet\\'s\\nDNS system to map E.164 ITU standard (ordinary telephone) numbers to email addresses, web sites, VoIP addresses, and the like. An ENUM number is created in DNS\\nby reversing the phone number, separating each digit with a period, and appending\\ne164.arpa (the primary DNS zone). If you want Asterisk to perform ENUM lookups,\\nconfigure the domain(s) in which to perform the lookups within the enum.conf file. In\\naddition to the official e164.arpa domain, you can have Asterisk perform lookups in\\nthe publicly accessible e164.org domain.\\n\\n470 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cextconfig.conf\\nAsterisk can write configuration data to and load configuration data from a database\\nusing the external configuration engine (also known as realtime). This enables you to\\nmap external configuration files (static mappings) to a database, allowing the information to be retrieved from the database. It also allows you to map special runtime\\nentries that permit the dynamic creation and loading of objects, entities, peers, and so\\non without a reload. These mappings are assigned and configured in the\\nextconfig.conf file, which is used by both res_odbc and realtime.\\n\\nextensions.conf\\nAt the center of every good universe is a dialplan. The extensions.conf file is the means\\nby which you tell Asterisk how you want calls to be handled. The dialplan contains a\\nlist of instructions that, unlike traditional telephony systems, is entirely customizable.\\nThe dialplan is so important that rather than defining it in this appendix, we have\\ndedicated all of Chapters 5 and 6, as well as Appendix B, to this topic. Go forth, read,\\nand enjoy!\\n\\nextensions.ael\\nThis file is the equivalent of extensions.conf, only it\\'s for dialplans written in the AEL\\nlanguage. When Asterisk loads the dialplan, it reads the AEL dialplan from exten\\nsions.ael and merges it with the dialplan from extensions.conf.\\n\\nfeatures.conf\\nfeatures.conf, the file formally known as parking.conf, contains configuration information related to call parking and call transfers. Call parking configuration options\\ninclude:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe extension to dial to park calls (parkext =>)\\nThe extension range to park calls in (parkpos =>)\\nWhich context to park calls in (context =>)\\nHow long a call can remain parked for before ringing the extension that parked it\\n(parkingtime =>)\\n The sound file played to the parked caller when the call is removed from parking\\n(courtesytone =>)\\n ADSI parking announcements (asdipark=yes|no)\\n\\nextconfig.conf | 471\\n\\x0cIn addition to the call parking options, in this file you can configure the button mappings for blind transfers, attended transfers, one-touch recording, disconnections, and\\nthe pickup extension (which allows you to answer a remotely ringing extension).\\n\\nfestival.conf\\nThe Festival text-to-speech engine allows Asterisk to read text files to the end user with\\na computer-generated voice. Festival is covered in Chapter 14.\\n\\nfollowme.conf\\nThe term findme/follow me is intended to give the impression that a PBX system has\\nthe intelligence to locate a user wherever they may be, such that their calls will find\\nthem and follow them. The followme.conf file is used to configure the FollowMe() dialplan application.\\n\\nfunc_odbc.conf\\nThe func_odbc dialplan function was one of the most anticipated capabilities to have\\nbeen added to Asterisk 1.4. This function provides a simple mechanism with which to\\nconnect to ODBC databases through the dialplan. The SQL queries are defined in this\\nconfiguration file, and a dialplan function is automatically created.\\n\\ngtalk.conf\\nThis configuration file is used to specify the parameters for connectivity with Google\\nTalk.\\n\\nhttp.conf\\nAsterisk has a very simple HTTP daemon built into it, which is used by the Asterisk\\nGUI and AJAM. This functionality is discussed in Chapter 11.\\n\\niax.conf\\nSimilar to sip.conf, the iax.conf file is where you configure options related to the IAX\\nprotocol. Your end devices and service providers are also configured here. The\\niax.conf file is covered in detail in Appendix A.\\n\\n472 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ciaxprov.conf\\nThis file is used by Asterisk to allow the system to provision and upgrade the firmware\\non an IAXy device.\\n\\nindications.conf\\nThe indications.conf file is used to tell Asterisk how to generate the various telephone\\nsounds common in different parts of the world; a dial tone in England sounds very\\ndifferent from a dial tone in Canada, but your Asterisk system will be pleased to make\\nthe sounds you want to hear. This file consists of a list of sounds a telephone system\\nmight need to produce (dial tone, busy signals, and so forth), followed by the frequencies used to generate those sounds.\\nBy default (and without an indications.conf file), Asterisk will use the tones common\\nin North America. You can change the default country for your system by specifying\\nthe two-letter country code in the [general] section. Supported country codes are listed\\nin the indications.conf.sample file located in /usr/src/asterisk/configs. If you have the\\nrequired information, your country can easily be added. Here\\'s what the configuration\\nfor North America looks like:\\n[general]\\ncountry=us\\n;\\n[us]\\ndescription = United States / North America\\nringcadance = 2000,4000\\ndial = 350+440\\nbusy = 480+620/500,0/500\\nring = 440+480/2000,0/4000\\ncongestion = 480+620/250,0/250\\ncallwaiting = 440/300,0/10000\\ndialrecall = !350+440/100,!0/100,!350+440/100,!0/100,!350+440/100,!0/100,350+440\\nrecord = 1400/500,0/15000\\ninfo = !950/330,!1400/330,!1800/330,0\\n\\njabber.conf\\nThe jabber.conf file specifies the information needed to allow Asterisk to interact with\\nan XMPP (Jabber) server.\\n\\nlogger.conf\\nThe logger.conf file specifies the type and verbosity of messages logged to the various\\nlogfiles in the /var/log/asterisk/ directory. It has two sections, [general] and [logfile].\\n\\niaxprov.conf | 473\\n\\x0c[general]\\nSettings under the [general] section are used to customize the output of the logs (and\\ncan safely be left blank, as the defaults serve most people very well). However, if you\\nlove to customize such things, read on.\\nYou can define exactly how you want your timestamps to look through the use of the\\ndateformat parameter:\\ndateformat=%F %T\\n\\nThe Linux manpage for strftime(3) lists all of the ways you can do this.\\nIf you want to append your system\\'s hostname to the names of the logfiles, set append\\nhostname=yes. This can be useful if you have a lot of systems delivering logfiles to you.\\nIf for some reason you do not want to log events from your queues, you can set\\nqueue_log=no.\\nIf generic events do not interest you, instruct Asterisk to omit them from the logfiles\\nby setting event_log=no.\\n\\n[logfiles]\\nThe [logfiles] section defines the types of information you wish to log. There are\\nmultiple ranks for the various bits of information that will be logged, and it can be\\ndesirable to separate log entries into different files. The general format for lines in the\\n[logfiles] section is filename => levels, where filename is the name of the file to save\\nthe logged information to and levels are the types of information you wish to save.\\nUsing console for the filename is a special exception that allows you to\\ncontrol the type of information sent to the Asterisk console.\\n\\nA sample [logfiles] section might look like this:\\n[logfiles]\\nconsole => notice,warning,error\\nmessages => notice,warning,error\\n\\nYou can specify logging of the following types of information:\\ndebug\\n\\nEnabling debugging gives far more detailed output about what is happening in the\\nsystem. For example, with debugging enabled, you can see what DTMF tones the\\nusers entered while accessing their voicemail boxes. Debugging information should\\nbe logged only when you are actually debugging something, as it will create massive\\nlogfiles very rapidly.\\n\\n474 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cverbose\\n\\nWhen you connect to the Asterisk console and set a verbosity of 3 or higher, you\\'ll\\nsee output on the console showing what Asterisk is doing. You can save this output\\nto a logfile by adding a line such as verbose_log => verbose to your logger.conf file.\\nNote that a high amount of verbosity can quickly eat up hard drive space.\\nnotice\\n\\nA notice is used to inform you of minor changes to the system, such as when a peer\\nchanges state. It is normal to see these types of messages, and the events they\\nindicate generally have no adverse effects on the server.\\nwarning\\n\\nA warning happens when Asterisk attempts to do something and is unsuccessful.\\nThese types of errors are usually not fatal, but they should be investigated, especially if a lot of them are seen.\\nerror\\n\\nErrors are often related to Out of Memory errors. They generally indicate serious\\nproblems that may lead to Asterisk to crash or freeze.\\n\\nmanager.conf\\nThe Asterisk Manager Interface is an API that external programs can use to communicate with and control Asterisk, much as you would do from the Asterisk console.\\nThe Manager gives programs the ability to run commands and request\\ninformation from the Asterisk server. However, it is not very secure; its\\nauthentication mechanism defaults to using plain-text passwords, and\\nall connected terminals default to receiving all events. The Asterisk\\nManager should be used only on a trusted local area network, or locally\\non the box. The permit and deny constructs allow you to restrict access\\nto certain extensions or subnets.\\n\\nMany of the available graphical interfaces to Asterisk--such as the Flash Operator\\nPanel--use the Manager to pull data and determine the status of applications. The\\nmanager.conf file defines the way programs authenticate with the Manager.\\nThe Manager commands (which you can list by typing show manager commands at the\\nAsterisk console) have varying degrees of privilege. You can control the read and write\\npermissions for these commands with the use of the read and write options in the\\nmanager.conf file.\\nHere\\'s a sample manager.conf file:\\n[general]\\nenabled = no\\nport = 5038\\nbindaddr = 0.0.0.0\\n\\nmanager.conf | 475\\n\\x0c[oreilly]\\nsecret = notvery\\nread = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\nwrite = system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user,config\\n\\nFor more information on the Asterisk Manager Interface, see Chapter 10.\\n\\nmeetme.conf\\nMeetMe is one of the more remarkable applications in Asterisk. It allows you to set up\\npredefined audio conference rooms. This rather simple concept has proven to be extremely expensive to implement in every other PBX, but what seems like a big deal to\\nthem is simple to Asterisk. Whether by using a dedicated server, or through the use of\\na service, Asterisk now delivers this functionality as a standard application.\\nMeetMe conferences can be created either dynamically, with the d flag in the Dial()\\napplication, or statically in the meetme.conf file. The format for creating conference\\nrooms is as follows:\\nconf => conference_number[,pin][,administrator_pin]\\n\\nAll conferences must be defined under the [rooms] section header.\\n[rooms]\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\nconf =>\\n\\n\\nmgcp.conf\\nThe Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) has only primitive support in Asterisk.\\nThis is likely due to the fact that SIP has stolen the limelight from every other VoIP\\nprotocol (except IAX, of course). Because of this, you should attempt to use Asterisk\\'s\\nMCGP channel in a production environment only if you are prepared to perform extensive testing, are willing to pay to have features and patches implemented within your\\ntime frames, and have in-house expertise with the protocol.\\nHaving said that, we are not prepared to pronounce MGCP dead. SIP is not yet the\\npanacea it has been touted as, and MGCP has proven itself to be very useful in carrier\\nbackbone environments. Many believe MGCP will fill a niche or void that has not yet\\nbeen discovered, and we remain interested in it.\\n\\n476 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cmodem.conf\\nThe modem.conf file is used by Asterisk to communicate with ISDN-BRI interfaces\\nthrough the ISDN4Linux driver. Since ISDN4Linux lacks many core ISDN features, it\\nis not generally used. For BRI, the most popular add-on seems to be chan_capi, available\\nfrom http://www.junghanns.net.\\n\\nmusiconhold.conf\\nThe musiconhold.conf file is used to configure different classes of music and their locations for use in music-on-hold applications. Asterisk can play hold music in any\\nnative file formats. Asterisk can also makes use of a certain version of mpg123 to play\\nMP3 files, but this is discouraged. You can specify arguments for a class, allowing you\\nto use an external application to stream music either locally or over a network.\\n\\nosp.conf\\nThe Open Settlement Protocol (OSP) is officially documented in ETSI TS 101 321, a\\nEuropean Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) document that came out of\\nthe work of the TIPHON working group. As far as we can tell, OSP is another attempt\\nto apply old-style telecom thinking to disruptive technologies.\\n\\noss.conf\\nThe oss.conf file is used to configure Asterisk to use the Open Sound System (OSS)\\ndriver to allow communications with the sound card via the CONSOLE channel. Note\\nthat ALSA is now the preferred interface for the CONSOLE channel.\\n\\nphone.conf\\nThe phone.conf file is used to configure a Quicknet PhoneJACK card. The PhoneJACK\\ncard seems to provide something like an FXS interface, in that you can plug an analog\\ntelephone into it and pass calls through Asterisk.\\n\\nprivacy.conf\\nThe privacy.conf file is used to control the maximum number of tries a user has to enter\\nhis 10-digit telephone number in the PrivacyManager() application. The\\nPrivacyManager() application determines if a Caller ID is set for the incoming call. The\\nuser enters his 10-digit number within the number of tries configured in privacy.conf,\\nthe application sets the PRIVACYMGRSTATUS channel variable to either SUCCESS or\\nFAILED. If the Caller ID is set, the application does nothing.\\nmodem.conf | 477\\n\\x0cThe PrivacyManager() application can also accept the arguments in the\\ndialplan. This allows the value to remain in memory, instead of an I/O\\noperation to the disk to read the configuration file, which you would\\nonly worry about with high usage of this application (many calls per\\nsecond).\\n\\nqueues.conf\\nAsterisk provides basic call center functionality via its queueing system, but those who\\nare using it in more mission-critical environments often report that their solutions required customization. You can do this customization in the queues.conf file.\\nThe [general] section of queues.conf contains settings that will apply to all queues. If\\nthe persistentmembers parameter is set to yes, a member that is added to the system\\nvia the AddQueueMember() application or through the Asterisk Manager Interface will be\\nstored in the AstDB, and therefore retained across a restart.\\nThe autofill parameter allows Asterisk to be more efficient in the way it distributes\\ncalls to queue members, especially if there are multiple callers in the queue and multiple\\nqueue members available to receive the call. It is recommended you set autofill to yes.\\nAnother general parameter of queues.conf is MonitorType. If set to MixMonitor, it will\\nmix the inbound and outbound audio streams. If set to Monitor, it will revert to the\\nolder method of recording the inbound and outbound audio in separate files.\\nNext you can define one or more queues by placing its name inside of square brackets\\n([]). Within each queue, the following parameters are available:\\nmusiconhold\\n\\nThis parameter allows you to configure which music-on-hold class (configured in\\nmusiconhold.conf) to use for the queue.\\nannounce\\n\\nWhen a call is presented to a member of the queue, the prompt specified by\\nannounce will be played to that agent before the caller is connected. This can be\\nuseful for agents who are logged in to more than one queue. You can specify either\\nthe full path to the file, or a path relative to /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/.\\nstrategy\\n\\nAsterisk can use six strategies to distribute calls to agents:\\nringall\\n\\nThe queue rings every available agent and connects the call to whichever agent\\nanswers first (this is the default).\\nroundrobin (deprecated)\\nThe queue cycles through the agents until it finds one who is available to take\\nthe call. roundrobin does not take into account the workload of the agents.\\nAlso, because roundrobin always starts with the first agent in the queue, this\\n478 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cstrategy is suitable only in an environment where you want your higher-ranked\\nagents to handle all calls unless they are busy, in which case the lower-ranked\\nagents may get a call.\\nleastrecent\\n\\nThe call is presented to the agent who has not been presented a call for the\\nlongest period of time.\\nfewestcalls\\n\\nThe call is presented to the agent who has received the least amount of calls.\\nThis strategy does not take into account the actual agent workloads; it considers only the number of calls they have taken (for example, an agent who\\nhas had 3 calls that each lasted for 10 minutes will be preferred over an agent\\nwho has had 5 calls each lasting 2 minutes).\\nrandom\\n\\nAs its name suggests, the random strategy chooses an agent at random. In a\\nsmall call center, this strategy may prove to be the most fair.\\nrrmemory\\n\\nThe queue cycles through the list of queue members, keeping track of which\\nmember last received a call. The next time a call needs to be distributed, Asterisk will continue from this point in the list of queue members. (This strategy\\nis known as round-robin memory). This ensures that call presentation cycles\\nthrough the agents as fairly as possible.\\nservicelevel\\n\\nIn a call center, the service level represents the maximum amount of time a caller\\nshould ideally have to wait before being presented to an agent. For example, if\\nservicelevel is set to 60 and the service level percentage is 80 percent, that means\\n80 percent of the calls that came into the queue were presented to an agent in less\\nthan 60 seconds.\\ncontext\\n\\nIf a context is assigned to a queue, the caller will be able to press a single digit to\\nexit to the corresponding extension within the configured context, if it exists. This\\naction takes the caller out of the queue, which means that she will lose her place\\nin line--be aware of this when you use this feature.\\ntimeout\\n\\nThe timeout value defines the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to let an\\nagent\\'s phone ring before deeming the agent unavailable and placing the call back\\ninto the queue.\\nretry\\n\\nWhen a timeout occurs, the retry value specifies how many seconds to wait before\\npresenting the call again to an available agent.\\n\\nqueues.conf | 479\\n\\x0cweight\\n\\nThe weight parameter assigns a rank to the queue. If calls are waiting in multiple\\nqueues, those queues with the highest weight values will be presented to agents\\nfirst. When you are designing your queues, be aware that this strategy can prevent\\na call in a lower-weighted queue from ever being answered. Always ensure that\\ncalls in lower-weighted queues eventually get promoted to higher-weighted queues\\nto ensure that they don\\'t have to hold forever.\\nmaxlen\\nmaxlen is the maximum number of calls that can be added to the queue before the\\n\\ncall goes to the next priority of the current extension.\\nannounce-frequency\\nThe announce-frequency value (defined in seconds) determines how often to an-\\n\\nnounce to the caller his place in the queue and estimated hold time.\\nannounce-holdtime\\n\\nThere are three possible values for this parameter: yes, no, and once. The announceholdtime parameter determines whether or not to include the estimated hold time\\nwithin the position announcement. If set to once, it will be played to the caller only\\nonce.\\nmonitor-format\\n\\nThis parameter accepts three possible values: wav, gsm, and wav49. By enabling this\\noption, you are telling Asterisk that you wish to record all completed calls in the\\nqueue in the format specified. If this option is not specified, no calls will be\\nrecorded.\\nmonitor-join\\nThe Monitor() application in Asterisk normally records either end of the conversation in a separate file. Setting monitor-join to yes instructs Asterisk to merge the\\nfiles at the end of the call. This should be set only if the MonitorType parameter is\\nset to Monitor.\\njoinempty\\n\\nThis parameter accepts three values: yes, no, and strict. It allows you to determine\\nwhether callers can be added to a queue based on the status of the members of the\\nqueue. The strict option will not allow callers to join the queue if all members are\\nunavailable.\\nleavewhenempty\\n\\nThis parameter determines whether you want your holding callers to be removed\\nfrom the queue when the conditions preventing a caller from joining exist (i.e.,\\nwhen all of your agents log out and go home).\\neventwhencalled\\nSet eventwhencalled to yes if you wish to have queue events presented on the Man-\\n\\nager Interface.\\n\\n480 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0ceventmemberstatusoff\\n\\nSetting this parameter to no will generate extra information pertaining to each\\nqueue member.\\nreportholdtime\\n\\nIf you set this parameter to yes, the amount of time the caller held before being\\nconnected will be announced to the queue member answering the call.\\nmemberdelay\\n\\nThis parameter defines whether a delay will be inserted between the time when the\\nqueue identifies a free agent and the time when the call is connected to that agent.\\nmember => member_name\\n\\nMembers of a queue can be either channel types or agents. Any agents you list here\\nmust be defined in the agents.conf file.\\n\\nres_odbc.conf\\nThe purpose of the res_odbc.so module is to store configuration file information in a\\ndatabase and retrieve that information from the database. The res_odbc.conf file specifies how to access the table within the database. The extconfig.conf file is used to\\ndetermine how to connect to the database.\\n\\nres_snmp.conf\\nThe res_snmp.conf file is used to configure SNMP support in Asterisk. There are two\\noptions in the [general]. The subagent option specifies whether res_snmp should run\\nas a subagent or a full SNMP agent. Asterisk defaults to running as a subagent. The\\nenabled option specifies whether SNMP support in Asterisk is enabled. This defaults\\nto no, so you\\'ll need to change this if you want SNMP support.\\n\\nrpt.conf\\nThe rpt.conf file is used to configure Jim Dixon\\'s newest project, Jim\\'s Radio Repeater\\nApplication (app_rpt), allows Asterisk to communicate using VoIP via radio repeater\\ntechnology. This allows people to efficiently provide large-area coverage of wireless\\nnetworking and routing information to the amateur radio public through their local\\nhigh-speed Internet connections.\\n\\nrtp.conf\\nThe rtp.conf file controls the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) ports that Asterisk\\nuses to generate and receive RTP traffic. The RTP protocol is used by SIP, H.323,\\nMGCP, and possibly other protocols to carry media between endpoints.\\n\\nres_odbc.conf | 481\\n\\x0cThe default rtp.conf file uses the RTP port range of 10,000 through 20,000. However,\\nthis is far more ports than you\\'re likely to need, and many network administrators may\\nnot be comfortable opening up such a large range in their firewalls. You can limit the\\nRTP port range by changing the upper and lower bound limits within the rtp.conf file.\\nFor every bidirectional SIP call between two endpoints, five ports are generally used:\\nport 5060 for SIP signaling, one port for the data stream and one port for the Real-Time\\nControl Protocol (RTCP) in one direction, and an additional two ports for the data\\nstream and RTCP in the opposite direction.\\nUDP datagrams contain a 16-bit field for a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which is\\nused to verify the integrity of the datagram header and its data. It uses polynomial\\ndivision to create the 16-bit checksum from the 64-bit header. This value is then placed\\ninto the 16-bit CRC field of the datagram, which the remote end can then use to verify\\nthe integrity of the received datagram.\\nSetting rtpchecksums=no requests that the OS not do UDP checksum creating/checking\\nfor the sockets used by RTP. If you add this option to the sample rtp.conf file, it will\\nlook like this:\\n[general]\\nrtpchecksums=no\\n\\nsay.conf\\nThe say.conf file is used to configure spoken language grammar rules for a number of\\napplications, such as SayNumber(). If you\\'re looking to use Asterisk in a language that\\nisn\\'t currently supported, you can script support through the configuation options in\\nthis file.\\n\\nsip.conf\\nThe sip.conf file defines all the SIP protocol options for Asterisk. The authentication\\nfor endpoints, such as SIP phones and service providers, is also configured in this file.\\nAsterisk uses the sip.conf file to determine which calls you are willing to accept and\\nwhere those calls should go in relation to your dialplan. Many SIP-related options are\\nconfigured in sip.conf, which was covered in depth in Appendix A.\\n\\nsip_notify.conf\\nAsterisk has the ability to remotely notify a SIP phone to recheck its configuration files\\nor reboot by sending it a specially formatted, manufacturer-specific NOTIFY message\\n\\n482 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0c(defined in sip_notify.conf). Because each of these messages is manufacturer-specific,\\nsupport varies from phone to phone.\\n\\nskinny.conf\\nIf you wish to connect to phones using Cisco\\'s proprietary Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP), you can use the skinny.conf file to define the parameters and channels\\nthat will use it. However, since the SCCP protocol is proprietary, you may find that\\nsupport in Asterisk for this protocol is less than perfect but steadily improving over time.\\n\\nsla.conf\\nEven though Asterisk is a modern PBX, many people still want it to behave like an old\\nkey system with shared lines. Asterisk can emulate a key system by configuring shared\\nlines in sla.conf.\\n\\nsmdi.conf\\nThis file configures the Station Message Desk Interface. SMDI is a very useful addition\\nto Asterisk, as it will allow it to act as a voicemail system for legacy PBXes that support\\nthe SMDI protocol.\\n\\nudptl.conf\\nThis file is used for the configuration of Asterisk\\'s support for UDPTL packets. UDPTL\\npackets are one of the transports used by T.38 faxing over IP connections.\\n\\nusers.conf\\nWith the advent of the Asterisk GUI, the Asterisk developers found it would be helpful\\nto create a configuration file where user accounts can be specified, instead of having\\ndifferent pieces spread across a myriad of files (such as extensions.conf, sip.conf, and\\nvoicemail.conf. This file is also updated by the Asterisk GUI when new users are added\\nto the system or when user settings are modified.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf\\nThe voicemail.conf file controls the Asterisk voicemail system (called Comedian Mail).\\nIt consists of three main sections. The first, called [general], sets the general systemwide settings for the voicemail system. The second, called [zonemessages], allows you\\nto configure different voicemail zones, which are a collection of time and time zone\\n\\nskinny.conf | 483\\n\\x0csettings. The third and final section is where you create one or more groups of voicemail\\nboxes, each containing the mailbox definitions. For more information on adding voicemail capabilities to your dialplan, see Chapter 6.\\n\\nGeneral Voicemail Settings\\nThe [general] section of voicemail.conf contains a plethora of options that affect the\\nentire voicemail system:\\nformat\\n\\nLists the codecs that should be used to save voicemail messages. Codecs should be\\nseparated with the pipe character (|). The first format specified is the format used\\nwhen attaching a voicemail message to an email. Defaults to wav49|gsm|wav. The\\nreason that the voicemail might be saved in several different formats is to minimize\\nthe amount of transcoding that Asterisk does when the voicemail is played back.\\nserveremail\\n\\nProvides the email address from which voicemail notifications should be sent.\\nattach\\n\\nSpecifies whether or not Asterisk should attach the voicemail sound file to the\\nvoicemail notification email.\\nmaxmsg\\n\\nSets the maximum number of messages that may be kept in any voicemail folder.\\nmaxmessage\\n\\nSets the maximum length of a voicemail message, in seconds.\\nminmessage\\n\\nSets the minimum length of a voicemail message, in seconds.\\nmaxgreet\\n\\nSets the maximum length of voicemail greetings, in seconds.\\nskipms\\n\\nSpecifies how many milliseconds to skip forward/back when the user skips forward\\nor backward during message playback.\\nmaxsilence\\n\\nIndicates how many seconds of silence to allow before ending the recording.\\nsilencethreshold\\n\\nSets the silence threshold (what we consider \"silence\"--the lower the threshold is,\\nthe more sensitive it is).\\nmaxlogins\\n\\nSets the maximum allowed number of failed login attempts.\\nuserscontext\\n\\nSpecifies which voicemail context the mailboxes defined in users.conf should be a\\npart of. This defaults to the default voicemail context.\\n\\n484 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cexternnotify\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of an external program to be executed when a\\nvoicemail is left or delivered, or when a mailbox is checked. It can also be set to\\nsmdi to use SMDI for external notification. If it is smdi, the smdiport should be set\\nto a valid port as specified in smdi.conf.\\nsmdiport\\n\\nSpecifies the communications port used by SMDI. This should correspond to a\\nvalid port as specified in smdi.conf. This is used when the externnotify setting is\\nset to smdi.\\nexternpass\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of an external program to be executed whenever\\na voicemail password is changed.\\ndirectoryintro\\n\\nIf set, overrides the default introduction to the dial-by-name directory.\\ncharset\\n\\nDefines the character set for voicemail messages.\\nadsifdn\\n\\nSpecifies the ADSI feature descriptor number to download to.\\nadsisec\\n\\nSets the ADSI security lock code.\\nadsiver\\n\\nIndicates the ADSI voicemail application version number.\\npbxskip\\n\\nCauses Asterisk not to add the string [PBX]: to the beginning of the subject line of\\na voicemail notification email.\\nfromstring:\\nChanges the From: string of voicemail notification email messages.\\nusedirectory\\n\\nPermits a mailbox owner to select entries from the dial-by-name directory for forwarding and/or composing new voicemail messages.\\nodbcstorage\\n\\nIf support for ODBC voicemail storage has been compiled into Asterisk, this option\\nallows you to specify which ODBC connection to use. ODBC connections are\\ndefined in res_odbc.conf.\\nodbctable\\n\\nThis option is used in conjunction with the odbcstorage option. This option specifies which database table to use for voicemail messages.\\nemailsubject\\n\\nSpecifies the email subject of voicemail notification email messages.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 485\\n\\x0cpagerfromstring\\n\\nChanges the From: string of voicemail notification pager messages.\\nemailbody\\n\\nSupplies the email body of voicemail notification email messages.\\nPlease note that all the emailsubject, emailbody, pagersubject, and\\npagerbody settings can use the following variables to provide more\\nin-depth information about the voicemail:\\n VM_NAME\\n VM_DUR\\n VM_MSGNUM\\n VM_MAILBOX\\n VM_CALLERID\\n VM_CIDNUM\\n VM_CIDNAME\\n VM_DATE\\n\\nemaildateformat\\n\\nSpecifies the format of the date and time for outbound email notifications. For\\nmore information on the format, see the strftime(3) manpage.\\nmailcmd\\n\\nSupplies the full path and filename of the program Asterisk should use to send\\nnotification emails. This option is useful if you want to override the default email\\nprogram.\\nnextaftercmd\\n\\nSkips to the next message after the user hits 7 or 9 to delete or save the current\\nmessage. This can be set only globally at this time, not on a per-mailbox basis.\\n\\nVoicemail Zones\\nAs voicemail users may be located in different geographical locations, Asterisk provides\\na way to configure the time zone and the way the time is announced for different callers.\\nEach unique combination is known as a voicemail zone. You configure your voicemail\\nzones in the [zonemessages] section of voicemail.conf. Later, you can assign your voicemail boxes to use the settings for one of these zones.\\nEach voicemail zone definition consists of a line with the following syntax:\\nzonename=timezone | time_format\\n\\nThe zonename is an arbitrary name used to identify the zone. The timezone argument is\\nthe name of a system time zone, as found in /usr/share/zoneinfo. The time_format ar-\\n\\n486 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cgument specifies how times should be announced by the voicemail system. The\\ntime_format argument is made up of the following elements:\\n\\' filename \\'\\n\\nThe filename of a sound file to play (single quotes around the filename are required)\\n${VAR}\\n\\nVariable substitution\\nA or a\\n\\nThe day of the week (Saturday, Sunday, etc.)\\nB or b or h\\nThe name of the month (January, February, etc.)\\nd or e\\nThe numeric day of the month (first, second... thirty-first)\\nY\\n\\nThe year\\nI or l\\n\\nThe hour, in 12-hour format\\nH\\n\\nThe hour, in 24-hour format--single-digit hours are preceded by \"oh\"\\nk\\n\\nThe hour, in 24-hour format--single-digit hours are not preceded by \"oh\"\\nM\\n\\nThe minute\\nP or p\\n\\nA.M. or .P.M.\\nQ\\n\\n\"today\", \"yesterday,\" or ABdY (note: not standard strftime value)\\nq\\n\\n\"\" (for today), \"yesterday\", weekday, or ABdY (note: not standard strftime value)\\nR\\n\\n24-hour time, including minutes\\nFor example, the following example sets up two different voicemail zones, one for the\\nCentral time zone in 12-hour format, and a second in the Mountain time zone, in 24hour format:\\n[zonemessages]\\ncentral=America/Chicago|\\'vm-received\\' Q \\'digits/at\\' IMp\\nmountain24=America/Denver|\\'vm-received\\' q \\'digits/at\\' H \\'digits/hundred\\' M \\'hours\\'\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 487\\n\\x0cDefining Voicemail Contexts and Mailboxes\\nNow that the system-wide settings and voicemail zones have been set, you can define\\nyour voicemail contexts and individual mailboxes.\\nVoicemail contexts are used to separate out different groups of voicemail users. For\\nexample, if you are using Asterisk to host voicemail for more than one company, you\\nshould place each company\\'s mailboxes in different voicemail contexts, to keep them\\nseparate. You might also use voicemail contexts to create per-department dial-by-name\\ndirectories.\\nTo define a new voicemail context, simply put the context name inside of square\\nbrackets, like this:\\n[default]\\n\\nInside a voicemail context, each mailbox definition takes the following syntax:\\nmailbox=password,name[,email[,pager_email[,options]]]\\n\\nThe mailbox argument is the mailbox number.\\nThe password argument is the numeric code the mailbox owner must enter to access\\nhis voicemail. If the password is preceded by a minus sign (-), the password may not\\nbe changed by the mailbox owner.\\nIf the password is set to d, then this line is assumed to provide an alternate name that can be used for this mailbox in the dial-by-name\\ndirectory. In the following example, people can reach extension 123 by\\nsearching for either Robert or Bob, along with a popular misspelling of\\nhis last name:\\n123 => d,Bob Schauerhamer\\n123 => d,Robert Showerhammer\\n\\nThe email and pager_email arguments are email addresses where voicemail notifications will be sent. These may be left blank if you don\\'t want to send voicemail\\nnotifications via email. The message sent to the pager_email address is usually shorter\\nand suitable for sending to a cell phone (via an email to SMS gateway) or to an alphanumeric pager.\\nThe options argument is a pipe-separated list of voicemail options that may be specified\\nfor the mailbox. (These options may also be set globally by placing them in the\\n[general] section.) Valid voicemail options include:\\ntz\\n\\nSets the voicemail zone from the [zonemessages] section earlier. This option is\\nirrelevant if envelope is set to no.\\n\\n488 | Appendix D: Configuration Files\\n\\x0cattach\\n\\nAttaches the voicemail to the notification email (but not to the pager email). May\\nbe set to either yes or no.\\nattachfmt\\n\\nSpecifies the format of the voicemail message that should be attached to the message sent to the notification email. Ordinarily, Asterisk uses the first format\\nspecified in the format parameter listed in [general] (covered earlier), but this may\\nalso be changed on a per-mailbox basis. This option may be set only on a permailbox basis.\\nThis option is often used if Windows users want wav49 attachments but Linux\\nusers want their attachments in gsm format.\\nsaycid\\n\\nSays the Caller ID information before the message.\\ncidinternalcontexts\\n\\nSets the internal context for name playback instead of extension digits when saying\\nthe Caller ID information.\\nsayduration\\n\\nTurns on/off the duration information before the message. Defaults to on.\\nsaydurationm\\n\\nSpecifies the minimum duration to say when sayduration is on. Default is two\\nminutes.\\ndialout\\n\\nSpecifies the context to dial out from (by choosing option 4 from the advanced\\nmenu). If not specified, dialing out from the voicemail system will not be permitted.\\nsendvoicemail\\n\\nSpecifies the context to send voicemail from (by choosing option 5 from the advanced menu). If not specified, sending messages from within the voicemail system\\nwill not be permitted.\\nsearchcontexts\\n\\nBy default, Asterisk searches only the default context if no context is specified. To\\nhave Asterisk search all contexts, set this option to yes.\\ncallback\\n\\nSpecifies the context to call back from. If not specified, calling the sender back from\\nwithin the voicemail system will not be permitted.\\nreview\\n\\nAllows senders to review/re-record their messages before saving them. Defaults to\\noff.\\noperator\\n\\nAllows senders to hit 0 before, after, or while leaving a voicemail message to reach\\nan operator. Defaults to off.\\n\\nvoicemail.conf | 489\\n\\x0cenvelope\\n\\nTurns on/off envelope playback before message playback. Defaults to on. This does\\nnot affect option 3,3 from the advanced options menu.\\ndelete\\n\\nDeletes voicemails from the server after notification is sent. This option may be set\\nonly on a per-mailbox basis; it is intended for use with users who wish to receive\\ntheir voicemail messages only by email.\\nvolgain\\n\\nIf your voicemail attachments to email are too quiet, you can set this option to\\nincrease the gain on the message before it is attached to the email notification.\\nThis option only works if the sox application has been installed on\\nyour Asterisk system.\\n\\nforcename\\n\\nForces new users to record their names. A new user is determined by the password\\nbeing the same as the mailbox number. Defaults to no.\\nforcegreetings\\n\\nForces new users to record greetings. A new user is determined by the password\\nbeing the same as the mailbox number. Defaults to no.\\nhidefromdir\\n\\nHides the mailbox from the dial-by-name directory. Defaults to no.\\ntempgreetwarn\\n\\nWarns users that their temporary greeting is still enabled.\\nYou can specify multiple options by separating them with the pipe character, as shown\\nin the definitions for mailboxes 102 and 103 below.\\nHere are some sample mailbox definitions:\\n[default]\\n; regular mailbox with email notification\\n; more advanced mailbox with email and pager notification and a couple of\\n; special options\\nattach=no|tz=central\\n; a mailbox with no email notification and lots of extra options\\n103 => 6522,John Q.

See the sample vpb.conf\\nfor more information.\\n\\nzapata.conf\\nThe zapata.conf file is used to define the relationship between Asterisk and the Zaptel\\ndriver. Because zapata.conf is specific to Asterisk, it is located with the other Asterisk\\nconfiguration files in /etc/asterisk/. As with zaptel.conf, the zapata.conf file contains a\\nmultitude of choices reflecting the multitude of hardware it supports, and we won\\'t try\\nto list all of the options here. In this book we\\'ve covered only the analog interfaces to\\nthe Zaptel driver, as described in Chapter 3.\\n\\nzaptel.conf\\nThe zaptel.conf file is not located with the other Asterisk .conf files; the Zaptel driver is\\navailable to any application that can make use of it, so it makes more sense to store it\\nin a non-Asterisk-specific directory (/etc/). zaptel.conf is parsed by the ztcfg program to\\nconfigure the TDM hardware elements in your system. You configure three main elements in the zaptel.conf file:\\n A way of identifying the interfaces on the card within the dialplan\\n The type of signaling the interface requires\\n The tone language associated with a particular interface, as found in zonedata.c\\nBe very careful not to plug your FXS module into a telephone line. The\\nvoltage associated with the phone line, especially during an incoming\\ncall, will be much too high for the module to handle and may permanently damage it, rendering it useless!\\n\\nWithin the zaptel.conf file, we define the type of signaling that the channel is going to\\nuse. We also define which channels to load. The options in the configuration file are\\nthe information that will be used to configure the channels with the ztcfg command.\\nThe actual parameters available in the zaptel.conf file are quite extensive, as a wide\\nvariety of PSTN interfaces make use of the Zaptel telephony engine. Also, as this technology is rapidly evolving, anything we write now may not be accurate by the time you\\nread it. Consequently, we won\\'t try to list all of the options here.\\nIn this book, we have focused on the Zaptel analog interfaces as provided by the Digium\\nTDM400P card (see Chapter 3).\\n\\nvpb.conf | 491\\n\\x0c\\x0cAPPENDIX E\\n\\nAsterisk Dialplan Functions\\n\\nDialplan functions are very powerful, and once you begin using them, you will wonder\\nhow you got along without them. Functions are used in the dialplan in a similar manner\\nto variables. If it helps, you can think of them as intelligent variables (or for those of\\nyou from the database world, variables with triggers). When you invoke them, they\\nperform a specific action, and their result becomes a part of the command in which\\nyou have included the function (in exactly the same way as a variable would).\\n\\nAGENT\\n\\nReturns information about an agent\\n\\nAGENT(agentid[:item])\\n\\nThis function allows you to retrieve information pertaining to agents and may only be\\nread, not set.\\nThe valid items to retrieve are:\\nstatus (default)\\n\\nThe status of the agent (LOGGEDIN | LOGGEDOUT)\\npassword\\n\\nThe password of the agent\\nname\\n\\nThe name of the agent\\nmohclass\\n\\nMusic-on-hold class\\nexten\\n\\nThe callback extension for the Agent (AgentCallbackLogin)\\nchannel\\n\\nThe name of the active channel for the Agent (AgentLogin)\\n\\n\\x0cAllows one to define several variables at one time\\n\\nARRAY\\n\\nThe comma-separated list, which the function equals, will be interpreted as a set of\\nvalues to which the comma-separated list of variable names in the argument should be\\nset.

CUT() is designed to help you\\nwork with data that may have multiple, variable-length sections, divided by a common\\ndelimiter.\\nThe most common case is the name of a channel, which is composed of two parts, a\\nbase name and a unique identifier (e.g., SIP/tom-abcd1234 or SIP/bert-1a2b3c4d).\\nCUT() may be used to trim the unique identifier, no matter how long the base name may\\nbe:\\n; Trim the unique identifier from the current channel name\\nexten => 123,1,Set(chan=${CUT(CHANNEL,-,1)})\\n\\nvarname is the name of the variable that will be operated on.

CUT() is somewhat\\nunique in this regard.\\nchar-delim is the character that will serve as the delimiter (\\'-\\' is the default)\\nrange-spec allows you to define which fields are returned. The range-spec can be specified as a range with - (e.g., 1-3) or a group of ranges and field numbers by separating\\neach with & (e.g., 1&3-4). Note that if multiple field numbers are specified, the resulting\\n\\nvalue will have its fields separated by the same delimiter.\\nrange-spec uses a 1-based offset. That is, the first field is field 1 (as\\n\\nopposed to a 0-based offset, where the first field would be 0).\\n\\nSee Also\\nFIELDQTY()\\n\\nDB\\n\\nRead or write to AstDB\\n\\nDB(family/key)\\n\\nCUT | 499\\n\\x0cWill return the value of the entry in the database (or blank if it does not exist), or set\\nthe value in the database.\\n\\nSee Also\\nDBdel(), DB_DELETE(), DBdeltree(), DB_EXISTS()\\n\\nDB_DELETE\\n\\nDeletes a key or key family from the AstDB database\\n\\nDB_DELETE(family/key)\\n\\nReturns a value from the database and delete it.\\n\\nSee Also\\nDBdel(), DB(), DBdeltree()\\nChecks AstDB for specified key\\n\\nDB_EXISTS\\nDB_EXISTS(family/key)\\n\\nCheck to see if a key exists in the Asterisk database.\\n\\nSee Also\\nDB()\\n\\nDUNDILOOKUP\\n\\nQueries DUNDi peers for a particular number\\n\\nDUNDILOOKUP(number[|context[|option)\\n\\nDoes a DUNDi lookup of a phone number.\\n\\nENUMLOOKUP\\n\\nQueries the ENUM database for a particular number\\n\\nENUMLOOKUP(number[|Method-type[|options[|record#[|zone-suffix]]]])\\n\\nAllows for general or specific querying of NAPTR records or counts of NAPTR types\\nfor ENUM or ENUM-like DNS pointers.\\n\\nENV\\nENV(envname)\\n\\nGets or sets the environment variable specified by envname.\\n\\n500 | Appendix E: Asterisk Dialplan Functions\\n\\nReferences environment variables\\n\\x0cEvaluates stored variables\\n\\nEVAL\\nEVAL(variable)\\n\\nEVAL() is one of the most powerful dialplan functions.

Starfish are\\nclassified as Asteroidea. They are a group of echinoderms, spiny-skinned invertebrates\\nfound only in the sea. Most starfish have fivefold symmetry (arms or rays in multiples\\nof five), though some species can have four or nine arms. But all starfish are radially\\nsymmetrical: they have arms or rays branching out from a central body disc. There are\\nover 1,500 species of starfish.\\nStarfish live on the floor of the sea and in tidal pools, clinging to rocks and moving\\n(slowly) using a water-based vascular system to manipulate their hundreds of tiny, tubelike legs, called podia. A small bulb or ampulla at the top of the tube contracts, expelling\\nwater and expanding the starfish\\'s leg. The ampulla relaxes, and the leg retracts. Starfish\\nuse muscles to bend their legs, but it is the flow of water pressure that keeps the feet\\nmoving. At the tip of each leg, starfish have suction cups that allow them to pry open\\nclam, oyster, or mussel shells. Many starfish can push their stomachs out through their\\nmouths in order to digest their prey in its shell. Starfish are carnivores; they eat coral,\\nfish, and snails, as well as bivalves.\\nStarfish can flex and rearrange their arms to fit into small places as they move over the\\nocean floor. At the end of each arm, they have eyespots, primitive sensors that detect\\nlight and help the starfish determine direction. Starfish also have the ability to regenerate a missing limb. Some species can even regrow a complete, new starfish from a\\nsevered arm.\\nThe cover image is from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover font is Adobe ITC\\nGaramond.

Now many view it as dated and badly in need of a rewrite rather than a simple upgrade. Windows 95 is the most popular operating system in the world--but\\nthis operating system is in many ways a copy of the Mac OS, less the Mac\\'s character. Many programmers and computer enthusiasts enjoy the command-line interface power of Unix--but Unix isn\\'t nearly intuitive enough for the average end\\nuser. What users really want is an operating system that has an easy-to-use graphical user interface, takes advantage of the power of today\\'s fast microprocessor\\nchips, and is unencumbered with the burdens of backward compatibility. Enter Be,\\nInc., and the BeOS--the Be operating system.\\nIn this introductory chapter, you\\'ll learn about the features of the BeOS from a\\nprogrammer\\'s perspective. In particular, you\\'ll read about the terminology relating\\nto the Be operating system. You\\'ll also get an overview of the layout of the application programming interface, or API, that you\\'ll be using to aid you in piecing\\ntogether your programs. After the overview, you\\'ll look at some of the fundamentals of writing applications for the BeOS. No attempt will be made to supply you\\nwith a full understanding of the concepts, techniques, and tricks of programming\\nfor this operating system--you\\'ve got the whole rest of the book for that! Instead,\\nin this chapter I\\'ll just give you a feel for what it\\'s like to write a program for the\\nBeOS. Finally, this chapter concludes with a first look at Metrowerks CodeWarrior--the integrated development environment you\\'ll be using to develop your\\nown applications that run on the BeOS.\\n\\nFeatures of the BeOS\\nWith any new technology comes a plethora of buzzwords. This marketing hype is\\nespecially true in the computer industry--innovative software and hardware seem\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nto appear almost daily, and each company needs some way to ensure that the\\npublic views their product as the best. Unsurprisingly, the BeOS is also accompanied by a number of buzzwords--multithreaded, multiprocessor support, and\\npreemptive multitasking being a few. What may be surprising is that this nomenclature, when applied to BeOS, isn\\'t just hype--these phrases really do define this\\nexciting operating system!\\n\\nMultithreaded\\nA thread is a path of execution--a part of a program that acts independently from\\nother parts of the program, yet is still capable of sharing data with the rest of program. An OS that is multithreaded allows a single program to be divided into several threads, with each thread carrying out its own task. The processor devotes a\\nsmall amount of time first to one thread and then to another, repeating this cycle\\nfor as long as it takes to carry out whatever task each thread is to perform. This\\nparallel processing allows the end user to carry out one action while another is\\ntaking place. Multithreading doesn\\'t come without a price--though fortunately in\\nthe BeOS this price is a rather small one. A program that creates multiple threads\\nneeds to be able to protect its data against simultaneous access from different\\nthreads. The technique of locking information when it is being accessed is one\\nthat is relatively easy to implement in BeOS programs.\\nThe BeOS is a multithreaded operating system--and a very efficient one. While\\nprogrammers can explicitly create threads, much of the work of handling threads\\nis taken care of behind the scenes by the operating system itself. For instance,\\nwhen a window is created in a program, the BeOS creates and maintains a separate thread for that one window.\\n\\nMultiprocessor Support\\nAn operating system that uses multithreading, designed so that threads can be sent\\nto different processors, is said to use symmetric multiprocessing, or SMP. On an\\nSMP system, unrelated threads can be sent to different processors. For instance, a\\nprogram could send a thread that is to carry out a complex calculation to one processor and, at the same time, send a thread that is to be used to transfer a file over\\na network to a second processor. Contrasting with symmetric multiprocessing\\n(SMP) is asymmetric multiprocessing, or AMP. A system that uses AMP sends a\\nthread to one processor (deemed the master processor) which in turn parcels out\\nsubtasks to the other processor or processors (called the slave processor or processors).\\nThe BeOS can run on single-processor systems (such as single-processor Power\\nMacintosh computers), but it is designed to take full advantage of machines that\\n\\x0cFeatures of the BeOS\\n\\n\\nhave more than one processor--it uses symmetric multiprocessing. When a Be\\nprogram runs on a multiprocessor machine, the program can send threads to each\\nprocessor for true parallel processing. Best of all, the programmer doesn\\'t need to\\nbe concerned about how to evenly divide the work load. The Be operating system is responsible for distributing tasks among whatever number of processors are\\non the host machine--whether that be one, two, four, or more CPUs.\\nThe capability to run different threads on different processors, coupled with the\\nsystem\\'s ability to assign threads to processors based on the current load on each\\nprocessor, makes for a system with very high performance.\\n\\nPreemptive Multitasking\\nAn operating system that utilizes multitasking is one that allows more than one\\nprogram to run simultaneously. If that operating system has cooperative multitasking, it\\'s up to each running program to yield control of system resources to allow\\nthe other running applications to perform their chores. In other words, programs\\nmust cooperate. In a cooperative multitasking environment, programs can be\\nwritten such that they don\\'t cooperate graciously--or even such that they don\\'t\\ncooperate at all. A better method of implementing multitasking is for an operating\\nsystem to employ preemptive multitasking. In a preemptive multitasking environment the operating system can, and does, preempt currently running applications.\\nWith preemptive multitasking, the burden of passing control from one program to\\nanother falls on the operating system rather than on running applications. The\\nadvantage is that no one program can grab and retain control of system resources.\\nIf you haven\\'t already guessed, the BeOS has preemptive multitasking. The BeOS\\nmicrokernel (a low-level task manager discussed later in this chapter) is responsible for scheduling tasks according to priority levels. All tasks are allowed use of a\\nprocessor for only a very short time--three-thousandths of a second. If a program\\ndoesn\\'t completely execute a task in one such time-slice, it will pick up where it\\nleft off the next time it regains use of a processor.\\n\\nProtected Memory\\nWhen a program launches, the operating system reserves an area of RAM and\\nloads a copy of that program\\'s code into this memory. This area of memory is then\\ndevoted to this application--and to this application only. While a program running under any operating system doesn\\'t intentionally write to memory locations\\nreserved for use by other applications, it can inadvertently happen (typically when\\nthe offending program encounters a bug in its code). When a program writes outside of its own address space, it may result in incorrect results or an aborted program. Worse still, it could result in the entire system crashing.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nAn operating system with protected memory gives each running program its own\\nmemory space that can\\'t be accessed by other programs. The advantage to memory protection should be obvious: while a bug in a program may crash that program, the entire system won\\'t freeze and a reboot won\\'t be necessary. The BeOS\\nhas protected memory. Should a program attempt to access memory outside its\\nown well-defined area, the BeOS will terminate the rogue program while leaving\\nany other running applications unaffected. To the delight of users, their machines\\nrunning BeOS rarely crash.\\n\\nVirtual Memory\\nTo accommodate the simultaneous running of several applications, some operating systems use a memory scheme called virtual memory. Virtual memory is\\nmemory other than RAM that is devoted to holding application code and data.\\nTypically, a system reserves hard drive space and uses that area as virtual memory. As a program executes, the processor shuffles application code and data\\nbetween RAM and virtual memory. In effect, the storage space on the storage\\ndevice is used as an extension of RAM.\\nThe BeOS uses virtual memory to provide each executing application with the\\nrequired memory. For any running application, the system first uses RAM to handle the program\\'s needs. If there is a shortage of available physical memory, the\\nsystem then resorts to hard drive space as needed.\\n\\nLess Hindered by Backward Compatibility\\nWhen a company such as Apple or Microsoft sets about to upgrade its operating\\nsystem, it must take into account the millions of users that have a large investment in software designed to run on the existing version of its operating system.\\nSo no matter how radical the changes and improvements are to a new version of\\nan operating system, the new OS typically accommodates these users by supplying backward compatibility.\\nBackward compatibility--the ability to run older applications as well as programs\\nwritten specifically for the new version of the OS--helps keep the installed base of\\nusers happy. But backward compatibility has a downside: it keeps an upgrade to\\nan operating system from reaching its true potential. In order to keep programs\\nthat were written for old technologies running, the new OS cannot include some\\nnew technologies that would \"break\" these existing applications. As a new operating system, the BeOS had no old applications to consider. It was designed to take\\nfull advantage of today\\'s fast hardware and to incorporate all the available modern programming techniques. As subsequent releases of the BeOS are made available, backward compatibility does become an issue. But it will be quite a while\\n\\x0cStructure of the BeOS\\n\\n\\nbefore original applications need major overhauling (as is the case for, say, a Macintosh application written for an early version of the Mac OS).\\n\\nStructure of the BeOS\\nBe applications run on hardware driven by either Intel or PowerPC microprocessors (check the BeOS Support Guides page at http://www.be.com/support/guides/\\nfor links to lists of exactly which Intel and PowerPC machines are currently supported). Between the hardware and applications lies the BeOS software. As shown\\nin Figure 1-1, the operating system software consists of three layers: a microkernel\\nlayer that communicates with the computer\\'s hardware, a server layer consisting of\\na number of servers that each handle the low-level work of common tasks (such\\nas printing), and a software kit layer that holds several software kits--shared\\nlibraries (known as dynamically linked libraries, or DLLs, to some programmers)\\nthat act as a programmer\\'s interface to the servers and microkernel.\\nApplication\\nSoftware Kits\\n\\nServer\\nMicrokernel\\nHardware\\nFigure 1-1. The layers of the BeOS reside between applications and hardware\\n\\nMicrokernel\\nThe bottom layer consists of the microkernel. The microkernel works directly with\\nthe hardware of the host machine, as well as with device drivers. The code that\\nmakes up the microkernel handles low-level tasks critical to the control of the\\ncomputer. For instance, the microkernel manages access to memory. The kernel\\nalso provides the building blocks that other programs use: thread scheduling, the\\nfile system tools, and memory-locking primitives.\\n\\nServers\\nAbove the microkernel lies the server layer. This layer is composed of a number of\\nservers--processes that run in the background and carry out tasks for applications\\nthat are currently executing. For example, the purpose of the Input Server is\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nto handle access to all the various keyboards, mice, joysticks, and other input\\ndevices that may be connected to a machine running the BeOS. Another server\\nis the Application Server, a very important server that handles the display of\\ngraphics and application communication. As a programmer you won\\'t work\\ndirectly with servers; instead, you\\'ll rely on software kits to access the power of\\nthe server software.\\n\\nKits\\nAbove the server layer is the software kit layer. A kit consists of a number of\\nobject-oriented classes that a programmer makes use of when writing a BeOS program. Collectively the classes in the software kits comprise the BeOS API. You\\nknow that the abbreviation API stands for application programming interface. But\\nwhat does the application interface to? Other software. For Be applications, the\\nkits are the interface to the various servers. For instance, the Application Kit holds\\nseveral classes used by programmers in your position who are trying to create\\ntools for users. The programmer writes code that invokes methods that are a part\\nof the classes of the Application Kit, and the Application Kit then communicates\\nwith the Application Server to perform the specified task. A couple of the other\\nservers you\\'ll encounter in your Be programming endeavors are the Print Server\\nand the Media Server.\\nSome kits don\\'t rely on servers to carry out microkernel-related operations--the\\nchores they take care of may be simple and straightforward enough that they don\\'t\\nneed their own server software. Instead, these kits directly invoke microkernel\\ncode. As you can see in Figure 1-1, an application relies directly on the software\\nkits and indirectly on the servers and microkernel.\\nAs you become more proficient at BeOS programming, you\\'ll also become more\\nintimate with the classes that comprise the various software kits. Now that you\\nknow this, you\\'ll realize that it is no accident that the majority of this book is\\ndevoted to understanding the purpose of, and working with, the various BeOS\\nkits.\\n\\nThis book is tutorial in nature. Its purpose is to get you acquainted\\nwith the process of developing applications that run on the BeOS\\nand to provide an overview of the BeOS API. Its purpose isn\\'t to\\ndocument the dozens of classes and hundreds of member functions\\nthat make up the BeOS API. After--or while--reading this book, you\\nmay want such a reference. If you do, consider the books Be Developer\\'s Guide and Be Advanced Topics, also by O\\'Reilly & Associates.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\nThe application programming interface of the BeOS is object-oriented--the code\\nthat makes up the software kits is written in C++. If you have experience programming in C++ on any platform, you\\'re already at the midpoint in your journey to\\nbecoming adept at BeOS programming. Now you just need to become proficient\\nin the layout and use of the classes that make up the software kits.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Overview\\nThe BeOS consists of about a dozen software kits--the number is growing as the\\nBeOS is enhanced. Don\\'t panic, though--you won\\'t be responsible for knowing\\nabout all the classes in all of the kits. Very simple applications require only the\\nclasses from a very few of the kits. For instance, an application that simply displays a window that holds text uses the Application Kit and the Interface Kit. A\\nmore complex application requires more classes from more kits. Presentation software that stores sound and video data in files, for example, might require the use\\nof classes from the Storage Kit, the Media Kit, and the Network Kit--as well as\\nclasses from the two previously mentioned kits. While it\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll ever\\nwrite a program that uses all of the BeOS kits, it\\'s a good idea to at least have an\\nidea of the purpose of each.\\n\\nThe kits of the BeOS are subject to change. As the BeOS matures,\\nnew functionality will be added. This functionality will be supported\\nby new classes in existing kits and, perhaps, entirely new software\\nkits.\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nThe Application Kit is a small but vitally important kit. Because every application is based on a class derived from the BApplication class that is defined\\nin this kit, every application uses the Application Kit.\\nThe Application Kit defines a messaging system (described later in this chapter) that makes applications aware of events (such as a click of a mouse button by the user). This kit also give applications the power to communicate\\nwith one another.\\nInterface Kit\\nThe Interface Kit is by far the largest of the software kits. The classes of this\\nkit exist to supply applications with a graphical user interface that fully supports user interaction. The definition of windows and the elements that are\\ncontained in windows (such as scrollbars, buttons, lists, and text) are handled\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nby classes in this kit. Any program that opens at least one window uses the\\nInterface Kit.\\nStorage Kit\\nThe Storage Kit holds the classes that store and update data on disks. Programs that work with files will work with the Storage Kit.\\nSupport Kit\\nAs its name suggests, the contents of the Support Kit support the other kits.\\nHere you\\'ll find the definitions of datatypes, constants, and a few classes.\\nBecause the Support Kit defines many of the basic elements of the BeOS (such\\nas the Boolean constants true and false), all applications use this kit.\\nMedia Kit\\nThe Media Kit is responsible for the handling of real-time data. In particular,\\nthis kit defines classes that are used to process audio and video data.\\nMidi Kit\\nThe Midi Kit is used for applications that process MIDI (Musical Instrument\\nDigital Interface) data.\\nKernel Kit\\nThe Kernel Kit is used by applications that require low-level access to the\\nBeOS microkernel. This kit defines classes that allow programmers to explicitly create and maintain threads.\\nDevice Kit\\nThe Device Kit provides interfaces to hardware connectors (such as the serial\\nport), and is necessary only for programmers who are developing drivers.\\nNetwork Kit\\nThe Network Kit exists to provide TCP/IP services to applications.\\nOpenGL Kit\\nThe OpenGL Kit provides classes that allow programmers to add 3D capabilities to their programs. The classes aid in the creation and manipulation of\\nthree-dimensional objects.\\nTranslation Kit\\nThe Translation Kit is useful when a program needs to convert data from one\\nmedia format to another. For instance, a program that can import an image of\\none format (such as a JPEG image) but needs to convert that image to another\\nformat might make use of this kit.\\nMail Kit\\nThe Mail Kit assists in adding Internet email services (such as sending messages using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to an application).\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nGame Kit\\nThe Game Kit--which is under development as of this writing--consists of\\ntwo major classes that support game developers.\\n\\nBeOS Naming Conventions\\nSome of the many classes that make up the BeOS are discussed a little later. As\\nthey\\'re introduced, you\\'ll notice that each starts with an uppercase letter \"B,\" as in\\nBMessage, BApplication, and BControl. This is no accident, of course--the\\nsoftware of the kits follows a naming convention.\\nThe BeOS software kits consist of classes (which contain member functions and\\ndata members), constants, and global variables. The BeOS imposes a naming convention on each of these types of elements so that anyone reading your code can\\nreadily distinguish between code that is defined by the BeOS and code that is\\ndefined by your own program. Table 1-1 lists these conventions.\\nTable 1-1. BeOS Naming Conventions\\nCategory\\n\\nPrefix\\n\\nSpelling\\n\\nExample\\n\\nClass name\\n\\nB\\n\\nBegin words with uppercase letter\\n\\nBRect\\n\\nMember function\\n\\nnone\\n\\nBegin words with uppercase letter\\n\\nOffsetBy()\\n\\nData member\\n\\nnone\\n\\nBegin words (excepting the first) with\\nuppercase letter\\n\\nbottom\\n\\nConstant\\n\\nB_\\n\\nAll uppercase\\n\\nB_LONG_TYPE\\n\\nGlobal variable\\n\\nbe_\\n\\nAll lowercase\\n\\nbe_clipboard\\n\\nClasses of the BeOS always begin with an uppercase \"B\" (short for \"BeOS\", of\\ncourse). Following the \"B\" prefix, the first letter of each word in the class name\\nappears in uppercase, while the remainder of the class name appears in\\nlowercase. Examples of class names are BButton, BTextView, BList, and\\nBScrollBar.\\nMember functions that are defined by BeOS classes have the first letter of each\\nword in uppercase and the remainder of the function name in lowercase. Examples of BeOS class member function names are GetFontInfo(), KeyDown(),\\nFrame(), and Highlight().\\nData members that are defined by BeOS classes have the first letter of each word\\nin uppercase and the remainder of the data member name in lowercase, with the\\nexception of the first word--it always begins in lowercase. Examples of BeOS\\nclass data member names are rotation and what.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nI\\'ve included only a couple of examples of data member names\\nbecause I had a hard time finding any! Be engineers went to great\\nlengths to hide data members. If you peruse the Be header files\\nyou\\'ll find a number of data members--but most are declared private and are used by the classes themselves rather than by you, the\\nprogrammer. You\\'ll typically make things happen in your code by\\ninvoking member functions (which themselves may access or alter\\nprivate data members) rather than by working directly with any data\\nmembers.\\n\\nConstants defined by BeOS always begin with an uppercase \"B\" followed by an\\nunderscore. The remainder of the constant\\'s name is in uppercase, with an underscore between words. Examples include: B_WIDTH_FROM_LABEL, B_WARNING_\\nALERT, B_CONTROL_ON, and B_BORDER_FRAME.\\nThe BeOS software includes some global variables. Such a variable begins with the\\nprefix \"be_\" and is followed by a lowercase name, as in: be_app, be_roster, and\\nbe_clipboard.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Inheritance Hierarchies\\nThe relationships between classes of a software kit can be shown in the inheritance hierarchy for that kit. Figure 1-2 shows such an inheritance hierarchy for the\\nlargest kit, the Interface Kit.\\n\\nThe kits that make up the BeOS don\\'t exist in isolation from one\\nanother. A class from one kit may be derived from a class defined in\\na different kit. The BWindow class is one such example. Kits serve as\\nlogical groupings of BeOS classes--they make it easier to categorize\\nclasses and conceptualize class relationships.\\n\\nFigure 1-2 shows that the object-oriented concept of inheritance--the ability of\\none class to inherit the functionality of another class or classes--plays a very large\\nrole in the BeOS. So too does multiple inheritance--the ability of a class to inherit\\nfrom multiple classes. In the figure, you see that almost all of the Interface Kit\\nclasses are derived from other classes, and that many of the classes inherit the contents of several classes. As one example, consider the six control classes pictured\\ntogether in a column at the far right of Figure 1-2. An object of any of these classes\\n(such as a BButton object) consists of the member functions defined in that class\\nas well as the member functions defined by all of the classes from which it is\\ndirectly and indirectly derived: the BControl, BInvoker, BView, BHandler, and\\n\\x0cSoftware Kits and Their Classes\\n\\n\\nBRoster\\nBRoster\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nBRegion\\nBPolygon\\n\\nApplication Kit\\n\\nApplication Kit\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBWindow\\n\\nBView\\n\\nBTextView\\n\\nBAlert\\n\\nBStringView\\nBPrintJob\\n\\nBBox\\n\\nBControl\\n\\nBTextControl\\n\\nBPicture\\n\\nBColorControl\\n\\nBBitmap\\n\\nBCheckBox\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\nBScrollBar\\n\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nBScrollView\\n\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nBSeparationItem\\n\\nBButton\\nBListView\\nBMenu\\n\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\nBMenu\\n\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-2. The inheritance hierarchy for the Interface Kit\\n\\nBArchivable classes. Figure 1-3 isolates the discussed classes for emphasis of this\\npoint. This figure shows that in inheritance hierarchy figures in this book, a class\\npictured to the left of another class is higher up in the hierarchy. In Figure 1-3,\\nBView is derived from BHandler, BControl is derived from BView, and so forth.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nUnderstanding the class hierarchies of the BeOS enables you to\\nquickly determine which class or classes (and thus which member\\nfunctions) you will need to use to implement whatever behavior\\nyou\\'re adding to your program. Obviously, knowledge of the class\\nhierarchies is important. Don\\'t be discouraged, though, if the hierarchies shown in Figures 1-2 and 1-3 don\\'t make complete sense to\\nyou. This chapter only provides an overview of the object-oriented\\nnature of the BeOS. The remainder of the book fills in the details of\\nthe names, purposes, and uses of the important and commonly used\\nclasses.\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBHandler\\nBView\\nBControl\\n\\nBTextControl\\nBColorControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBPictureButton\\nBButton\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-3. The Interface Kit classes that contribute to the various control classes\\n\\nThe BControl class defines member functions that handle the needs common to\\nany type of control. For instance, a control should be able to have two states:\\nenabled or disabled. An enabled control is active, or usable by the user. A disabled control is inactive--and has a greyed-out look to let the user know it is\\nunusable. To give controls the ability to implement this behavior, the BControl\\nclass includes the SetEnabled() member function. This routine is used to enable\\nor disable a control--any kind of control. Individual types of controls will have\\nsome needs that aren\\'t common to all other types of controls and thus can\\'t be\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nimplemented by the BControl class. For example, different controls (such as buttons and checkboxes) have different looks. To make it possible for each control\\ntype to be able to draw itself, each control class defines its own constructor to initialize the control and a Draw() member function to handle the drawing of the\\ncontrol.\\n\\nNot all BeOS classes are derived from other classes--there are a few\\nclasses that don\\'t rely on inheritance. Two examples, both of which\\nhappen to be in the Interface Kit, are the BRect and BPoint classes.\\nThe BRect class is used to create objects representing rectangles. A\\nrectangle is an easily defined, two-dimensional shape that\\'s considered a basic datatype. As such, it doesn\\'t need to inherit the functionality of other classes. The BPoint class is not a derived class for\\nthe same reason.\\n\\nBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\nIn the previous section, you gained an understanding of how the BeOS is composed of numerous interrelated classes that are defined in software kits. Together\\nthese classes form an application framework from which you build your Be applications. Your program will create objects that are based on some of the BeOS\\nclasses. These objects will then communicate with one another and with the operating system itself through the use of messages. In this section, you\\'ll look at a few\\nof the most important of these classes, and you\\'ll see how they\\'re used. You\\'ll also\\nsee how messages play a role in a BeOS program. To make the transition from the\\ntheoretical to the practical, I\\'ll supply you with a few C++ snippets--as well as the\\ncode for a complete Be application. In keeping with the introductory nature of this\\nchapter, I\\'ll make this first application a trivial one.\\n\\nMessages, Threads, and Application Communication\\nEarlier in this chapter, you read that the BeOS is a multithreaded operating system. You also read that the term multithreaded isn\\'t just bandied about by BeOS\\nadvocates for no good reason--it does in fact play a key role in why the BeOS is a\\npowerful operating system. Here, you\\'ll get an introduction as to why that\\'s true.\\nIn Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, I\\'ll have a lot more to say about\\nmultithreading.\\nApplications and messages\\nA Be application begins with the creation of an object of a class type derived from\\nthe BApplication class--a class defined in the Application Kit. Figure 1-4 shows\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nhow the BApplication class fits into the inheritance hierarchy of the Application\\nKit. Creating an application object establishes the application\\'s main thread, which\\nserves as a connection between the application and the Application Server. Earlier\\nin this chapter, you read that a BeOS server is software that provides services to an\\napplication via a software kit. The Application Server takes care of many of the\\ntasks basic to any application. One such task is reporting user actions to applications. For instance, if the user clicks the mouse button or presses a key on the\\nkeyboard, the Application Server reports this information to executing applications. This information is passed in the form of a message, and is received by an\\napplication in its main thread. A message is itself an object--a parcel of data that\\nholds details about the action being reported. The ability of the operating system\\nto determine the user\\'s actions and then use a separate thread to pass detailed\\ninformation about that action to a program makes your programming job easier.\\nBRoster\\nBClipboard\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nBApplication\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nBWindow\\n\\nBMessenger\\nBMessageFiller\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBMessageQueue\\n\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 1-4. The inheritance hierarchy for the Application Kit\\n\\nAn application\\'s code can explicitly define BMessage objects and use them to pass\\ninformation. What I\\'ve discussed above, however, are system messages that originate from within the BeOS itself. The movement of the mouse, the pressing of a\\nkeyboard key, a mouse button click in a window\\'s close button, and a mouse button click and drag in a window\\'s resize knob are all examples of system messages. Each type of system message has a command constant associated with it.\\nThis constant names the type of event the message represents. Examples of command constants are B_KEY_DOWN, B_MOUSE_DOWN, and B_WINDOW_RESIZED.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nMessage loops and message handling\\nThe BeOS defines classes that allow the creation of objects that can work with\\nmessages. The Application Kit defines two such classes: the BLooper class and the\\nBHandler class. The BLooper class is used to create an object that exists in its\\nown thread. The purpose of this thread is to run a message loop. As messages\\nreach a message loop thread, they are placed in a queue. From this queue the\\nthread extracts and dispatches messages one after another.\\nA message is always dispatched to an object of the BHandler class. The job of the\\nBHandler object is to handle the message it receives. How it handles a message is\\ndependent on the type of message it receives.\\nAs shown back in Figure 1-4, the BLooper class is derived from the BHandler\\nclass. This means that an object of the BLooper class (or of a class derived from\\nBLooper) can have both a message loop that dispatches messages and can receive\\nthese messages itself for handling. Because the BApplication class and the\\nBWindow class are derived from the BLooper class, such is the case for the application itself and any of its windows. Just ahead you\\'ll read a little more on how an\\napplication and windows can in fact watch for and respond to messages.\\nTo summarize, a BLooper object has a thread that runs a message loop that dispatches messages, and a BHandler object receives and handles these dispatched\\nmessages. Because the BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, a\\nBLooper object can dispatch and receive and handle messages. A BHandler\\nobject can only receive and handle messages. From that description it might seem\\nthat all objects that deal with messages might as well be BLooper objects. After all,\\nthe BLooper class provides more functionality. As you read more about messaging, you\\'ll see why that path isn\\'t the one to take. Each BLooper object creates a\\nnew thread and dominates it with a message loop--the thread shouldn\\'t be used\\nfor any other purpose. A BHandler object, on the other hand, doesn\\'t create a\\nthread. While having multiple threads in a program can be advantageous, there\\'s\\nno benefit to creating threads that go unused.\\n\\nDefining and Creating Windows\\nAt the heart of the graphical user interface of the Be operating system is the window. Be applications are window-based--windows are used to accept input from\\nthe user by way of menus and controls such as buttons, and to display output to\\nthe user in the form of graphics and text. The Interface Kit--the largest of the\\nkits--exists to enable programmers to provide their Be applications with a graphical user interface that includes windows. It is classes of the Interface Kit that you\\'ll\\nbe using when you write a program that displays and works with windows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nThe BWindow class\\nAlmost all Be applications display at least one window and therefore use the\\nBWindow class--one of the dozens of classes in the Interface Kit. If you look in the\\nWindow.h header file that is a part of the set of header files used in the compilation of a Be program, you\\'ll find the declaration of the BWindow class. I\\'ve\\nincluded a partial listing (note the ellipses) of this class below. Here you can see\\nthe names of a dozen of the roughly one hundred member functions of that class.\\nLooking at the names of some of the member functions of the BWindow class gives\\nyou a good indication of the functionality the class supplies to BWindow objects.\\nclass BWindow : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nBWindow(BRect frame,\\nconst char *title,\\nwindow_type type,\\nuint32 workspace = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE);\\n...\\nvirtual\\n\\n~BWindow();\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nQuit();\\nClose();\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nheight);\\n...\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nDispatchMessage(BMessage *message, BHandler *handler);\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nFrameMoved(BPoint new_position);\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMinimize(bool minimize);\\nZoom(BPoint rec_position, float rec_width, float rec_\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\nMoveBy(float dx, float dy);\\nMoveTo(BPoint);\\nMoveTo(float x, float y);\\nResizeBy(float dx, float dy);\\nResizeTo(float width, float height);\\nShow();\\nHide();\\nIsHidden() const;\\n\\nconst char\\nvoid\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\n*Title() const;\\nSetTitle(const char *title);\\nIsFront() const;\\nIsActive() const;\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in viewing the entire BWindow class declaration,\\nyou can open the Window.h header file. The path that leads to the\\nWindow.h file will most likely be develop/headers/be/interface.\\nThere\\'s a good chance that your development environment resides\\nin your root directory, so look for the develop folder there. You can\\nopen any header file from the Edit text editor application or from the\\nBeIDE. The Metrowerks CodeWarrior BeIDE programming environment is introduced later in this chapter and discussed in more detail\\nin Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects.\\n\\nDeriving a class from BWindow\\nA Be program that uses windows could simply create window objects using the\\nBWindow class. Resulting windows would then have the impressive functionality\\nprovided by the many BWindow member functions, but they would be very\\ngeneric. That is, while they could be moved, resized, and closed (BWindow member functions take care of such tasks), they would have no properties that made\\nthem unique from the windows in any other application. Instead of simply creating a BWindow object, programs define a class derived from the BWindow class.\\nThis derived class, of course, inherits the member functions of the BWindow class.\\nAdditionally, the derived class defines new member functions and possibly overrides some inherited member functions to give the class the properties that windows of the application will need. The following snippet provides an example:\\nclass SimpleWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nSimpleWindow(BRect frame);\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nFrom the BeOS naming conventions section of this chapter, you\\nknow that the name of a class that is a part of the BeOS API (such as\\nBWindow) always starts with an uppercase \"B.\" As long as my own\\nclasses (such as SimpleWindow) don\\'t start with an uppercase \"B,\"\\nanyone reading my code will be able to quickly spot classes that are\\nof my own creation.\\n\\nThe SimpleWindow constructor\\nThe SimpleWindow class declares a constructor and one member function. The\\ndefinition of the constructor follows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\nSimpleWindow::SimpleWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"A Simple Window\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThis constructor makes use of a technique common in Be applications: the constructor for the class derived from the BWindow class invokes the BWindow class\\nconstructor. Calling the BWindow class constructor is important because the\\nBWindow constructor arguments provide important information to the window\\nobject that is to be created. In Chapter 5, Drawing, I discuss the four BWindow\\nconstructor parameters in detail. In this introduction, it will suffice for me to say\\nthat the four parameters specify the following for a newly created window object:\\n\\n\\nThe frame, or content area of the window (the size and screen placement of\\nthe window)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe name of the window (as it will appear in the window\\'s tab)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe type of the window (the look and feel of the window)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe behavior of the window (whether it has a resize knob, and so forth)\\n\\nRecall from your C++ background that when the definition of a constructor is followed by a single colon and the base class constructor,\\nthe effect is that the base class constructor gets invoked just before\\nthe body of the derived class constructor executes.\\n\\nIn this example, the BWindow constructor\\'s first argument comes from the sole\\nargument passed to the SimpleWindow constructor. A hardcoded string serves as\\nthe second argument to the BWindow constructor. The third and fourth arguments\\nare constants defined in the Window.h header file.\\nNotice that the body of the SimpleWindow constructor is empty. This tells you that\\nthe only chore of the SimpleWindow constructor is to invoke the BWindow constructor. You have to call the BWindow constructor; this function creates a new\\nwindow and spawns a new thread of execution in which the window runs, and\\nstarts up a message loop in that same thread. In a Be program, each window\\nexists in its own thread and each window is notified of system messages that\\ninvolve the window. You\\'ll be pleased to find that the work of maintaining a window\\'s thread and of keeping a window informed of system messages (such as a\\nmouse button click in the window) is taken care of by the operating system. You\\'ll\\nbe even more pleased to find that for some system messages, even the window\\'s\\nresponse to the message is handled by the BeOS. For instance, you needn\\'t write\\nany code that watches for or handles the resizing of a window.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nA window can watch for and respond to messages because the BWindow class\\ninherits from both the BLooper and BHandler classes (see Figure 1-4). A window\\nis thus a window (from BWindow), an object that includes a message loop (from\\nBLooper), and an object that responds to messages (from BHandler). This pertains to BWindow objects and, of course, objects created from classes derived from\\nthe BWindow class--such as objects of my SimpleWindow class type.\\nThe SimpleWindow QuitRequested() member function\\nThe SimpleWindow class declares one member function. Here\\'s the definition of\\nQuitRequested():\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nQuitRequested() is actually a member function of the BLooper class. Because\\nmy SimpleWindow class is derived from the BWindow class, which in turn is\\nderived from the BLooper class, this member function is inherited by the\\nSimpleWindow class. By redeclaring QuitRequested(), SimpleWindow is overriding this function.\\nIf I had opted not to override the QuitRequested() member function in the\\nSimpleWindow class, it would be the BLooper version of this function that would\\nexecute upon a user mouse button click in a window\\'s close button. Like my\\nSimpleWindow version of QuitRequested(), the version of QuitRequested()\\ndefined by the BLooper class returns a value of true. The effect is for an object\\nof BLooper type to kill the thread it is running in and delete itself. That sounds\\nmuch like what I\\'d like to do in response to the user\\'s attempt to close a window--kill the thread in which the window is running. And it is. But in my trivial\\nexample program, I\\'ll only be allowing a single window to appear on the screen.\\nWhen the user closes that window, I\\'ll want to terminate the application, not just\\nthe window. That\\'s the action I\\'ve added to the QuitRequested() function with\\nthis line of code:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\n\\nA mouse button click in a window\\'s close button generates a system message that\\ngets passed to the window. The window is a type of BLooper, so it captures messages in its message loop. A window is also a type of BHandler, so it can handle\\nthis message (as opposed to having to pass it to some other type of object for handling). It handles the message by invoking QuitRequested(). If my\\nSimpleWindow class didn\\'t override the BLooper version of this function, the\\nBLooper version would be executed and the window would close--but the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\napplication wouldn\\'t quit. That\\'s because the BLooper version only kills its own\\nthread in order to delete itself. Because SimpleWindow does override\\nQuitRequested(), it is the SimpleWindow version of this function that instead\\ngets invoked. The SimpleWindow version posts a B_QUIT_REQUESTED message to\\nthe application to tell the application to also quit. The notation used in the above\\nline (be_app->PostMessage()) is new to you, so it\\'s worthy of examination.\\nYou already know that a window is a type of BLooper, but there is another very\\nimportant type of BLooper: the application itself. An application is always represented by an application object--an object of the BApplication class that is\\ndefined in the Application Kit (refer back to Figure 1-4 if you need to verify the\\nrelationship between the BLooper class and the BWindow and BApplication\\nclasses). The PostMessage() routine is a member function of the BLooper class.\\nA BLooper object can invoke this function to place a message in the queue of its\\nown message loop.\\nAs you\\'ll see ahead, be_app is a global variable that represents the application\\nobject. This variable is always available for use by your code. The above line of\\ncode invokes the application object\\'s version of the PostMessage() function. The\\nmessage the application object places in its message loop is one that tells itself to\\nquit.\\n\\nThe variable be_app is a pointer to an object--the use of the membership access operator (->) to invoke PostMessage() tells you\\nthat. As is often the case in object-oriented programming, a pointer\\nto an object is simply referred to as the object itself. So in this book,\\nas well as in other Be documentation, you\\'ll read about the \"application object\" in discussions that include mention of be_app.\\n\\nAfter the call to PostMessage() places a request to kill the application thread in\\nthe application object\\'s message queue, the SimpleWindow version of\\nQuitRequested() returns a value of true. Remember, QuitRequested() won\\'t\\nbe called by my own code--it will be invoked by the system in response to the\\nmouse button click in a window\\'s close button. By returning a value of true,\\nQuitRequested() is telling the system that the requested service should be carried out. The system will then kill the window thread to dispose of the window.\\nPreviously I mentioned that the BeOS took care of system messages involving a\\nwindow. I gave the example of window resizing being handled by the operating\\nsystem. Yet here I\\'m discussing how my own code is being used to handle the\\nsystem message that gets generated by a click in a window\\'s close button. It\\'s\\nimportant to restate what I just discussed. It wouldn\\'t be necessary to include any\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nwindow-closing code in my SimpleWindow class if my goal was only to have a\\nmouse button click in the close button result in the closing of the window. The\\nQuitRequested() function defined in BLooper would take care of that by killing the window\\'s thread. I, however, also want the program to terminate when a\\nwindow\\'s close button is clicked. To get that extra action, I need to override\\nQuitRequested().\\nIn summary, a mouse button click in a window\\'s close box automatically causes\\nQuitRequested() to execute. If a window class doesn\\'t override this function,\\nthe window closes but the application continues to run. If the window class does\\noverride this function, what happens is determined by the code in this new version of the function. In my SimpleWindow class example, I choose to have this\\nfunction tell the application to quit and tell the window to close.\\nCreating a window object\\nDeclaring a class and defining its constructor and member functions only serves to\\nspecify how objects of this class type will look and behave--it doesn\\'t actually create any such objects. To create and display a window object you\\'ll first declare a\\nvariable that will be used to point to the object:\\nSimpleWindow\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\nBefore going ahead and allocating the memory for a new window object, your\\ncode should declare and set up a rectangle object that will serve to establish the\\nsize and screen placement of the new window:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nThe above snippet first declares and creates a rectangle object. The BRect class\\nwas briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter--it is discussed at length in\\nChapter 6, Controls and Messages. Next, the Set() member function of the BRect\\nclass is called to establish the dimensions of the rectangle. The Set() function\\'s\\nfour parameters specify the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates, respectively.\\nThe above call to Set() establishes a rectangle that will be used to create a\\nwindow with a left side 20 pixels in from the left of the screen and a top 20 pixels down from the top of the screen. While the window that will use this rectangle would seem to have a width of 180 pixels (20020) and a height of 40 pixels\\n(6020), it will actually have a width of 181 pixels and a height of 41 pixels. This\\napparent one-pixel discrepancy is explained in the screen and drawing coordinates section of Chapter 5.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nWith the window\\'s bounding rectangle established, it\\'s time to go ahead and create a new window. This line of code performs that feat:\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\n\\nTo dynamically allocate an object, use the new operator. Follow new with the constructor of the class from which the object is to be created. If you glance back at\\nthe section that describes the SimpleWindow constructor, you\\'ll be reminded that\\nthis function has one parameter--a BRect object that defines the size of the window and gets passed to the BWindow constructor.\\nAfter allocating memory for a SimpleWindow object, the system returns a pointer\\nto this memory. That pointer is stored in the aWindow variable. Until this new window is deleted, it can be accessed via this pointer. This line of code provides an\\nexample:\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nBy default, a newly created window is not visible. To display the window, your\\ncode should call the BWindow member function Show() as I\\'ve done in the above\\nline.\\nLet\\'s end this section by pulling together the code that\\'s just been introduced.\\nHere\\'s a look--with comments--at how a window is typically created in a Be\\napplication:\\nSimpleWindow\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\naRect;\\n\\n\\n// declare a pointer to a SimpleWindow\\n// object\\n// declare a rectangle object\\n\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\n\\n// specify the boundaries of the\\n// rectangle\\n// create a SimpleWindow object\\n\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\n// display the newly created window\\n\\nYou may have noticed that I used the new operator to create a window object, but\\ncreated a rectangle object without a new operator. In Be programs, objects can\\nalways be, and sometimes are, allocated dynamically. That is, the new operator is\\nused to set aside memory in the program\\'s heap--as I\\'ve done with the window.\\nSome objects, however, are allocated statically. That is, an object variable (rather\\nthan a pointer) is declared in order to set aside memory on the stack--as I chose\\nto do with the rectangle. Creating an object that resides on the stack is typically\\ndone for objects that are temporary in nature. In the above snippet, the rectangle\\nobject fits that bill--it exists only to provide values for the window\\'s dimensions.\\nAfter the creation of the window, the rectangle object is unimportant.\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nIf you aren\\'t familiar with the term heap, I should explain that it is\\nan area in a program\\'s address space that exists to hold objects that\\nare created dynamically during the execution of a program. An\\nobject can be added or deleted from the heap without regard for its\\nplacement in the heap, or for the other contents of the heap. The\\nstack, on the other hand, is used to store objects in a set order--\\nobjects are stacked one atop the other. Objects can only be added\\nand removed from the top of the stack.\\n\\nDefining an Application\\nEvery Be program must create an object that represents the application itself. This\\none object is the first one created when a program launches and the last one\\ndeleted when the program quits. One of the primary purposes of the application\\nobject is to make and maintain a connection with the Application Server. It is the\\nApplication Server that takes care of the low-level work such as handling interactions between windows and monitoring input from data entry sources such as the\\nkeyboard and mouse.\\nThe BApplication class\\nTo create the application object, you first define a class that is derived from the\\nBApplication class and then create a single instance of that class (an instance\\nbeing nothing more than another name for an object). From the Application.h\\nheader file, here\\'s a partial listing of the BApplication class:\\nclass BApplication : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n...\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\n\\nBApplication(const char * signature);\\n~BApplication();\\nthread_id\\nvoid\\n\\nRun();\\nQuit();\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nShowCursor();\\nHideCursor();\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\nReferring back to Figure 1-4, you can see that the BApplication class is both a\\ntype of BLooper and a type of BHandler. This means that an application object is\\ncapable of having a message loop, and is capable of handling messages in that\\nloop. As it turns out, the application object runs the application\\'s main message\\nloop. It is this loop that receives messages that affect the application.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nDeriving a class from BApplication\\nEvery application defines a single class derived from the BApplication class. A\\nprogram that will be communicating with other programs may define a number of\\nmember functions to handle this interapplication communication. A simpler application might define nothing more than a constructor, as shown here:\\nclass SimpleApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nSimpleApplication();\\n};\\n\\nThe SimpleApplication constructor\\nWhen a Be program starts, it\\'s common practice for the program to open a single\\nwindow without any help from the user. Because the SimpleApplication()\\nconstructor executes at program launch (that\\'s when the application object is created), it would make sense to let this constructor handle the job of creating and\\ndisplaying a window. Here\\'s a look at how the constructor does that:\\nSimpleApplication::SimpleApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-simpleapp\")\\n{\\nSimpleWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nJust as my SimpleWindow class invoked the constructor of the class it was derived\\nfrom (the BWindow class), so does my SimpleApplication class invoke the constructor of the class it is derived from (the BApplication class). Invoking the\\nBApplication constructor is necessary for a few reasons. The BApplication\\nconstructor:\\n\\n\\nConnects the application to the Application Server\\n\\n\\n\\nProvides the application with a unique identifying signature for the program\\n\\n\\n\\nSets the global variable be_app to point to the new application object\\n\\nThe connecting of an application to the Application Server has already been mentioned. This connection allows the server to send messages to the application. The\\napplication signature is a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) string. The\\nphrase application/x-vnd. should lead off the signature. Any characters you want\\ncan follow the period, but convention states that this part of the MIME string consist of an abbreviation of your company\\'s name, a hyphen, and then part or all of\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nthe program name. In the above example, I\\'ve used my initials (dps) as the company name. I\\'ve elected to name my program SimpleApp, so the MIME string ends\\nwith simpleapp. The assignment of an application\\'s signature is described at\\ngreater length in Chapter 2. The global variable be_app was introduced in the earlier discussion of windows. This variable, which is always available for your program\\'s use, always points to your program\\'s BApplication object.\\nIn the \"Creating a window object\" section that appears earlier, you saw five lines\\nof code that demonstrated how a window object could be created and how its\\nwindow could be displayed on the screen. If you compare the body of the\\nSimpleApplication() constructor to those five lines, you\\'ll see that they are\\nidentical.\\nCreating an application object\\nAfter defining a class derived from the BApplication class, it\\'s time to create an\\napplication object of that class type. You can create such an object dynamically by\\ndeclaring a pointer to the class type, then using the new operator to do the following: allocate memory, invoke a constructor, and return a pointer to the allocated\\nmemory. Here\\'s how that\\'s done:\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\n*myApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication = new SimpleApplication();\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, myApplication can be used to invoke any of the\\nmember functions of the BApplication class (from which the\\nSimpleApplication class is derived). In particular, soon after creating an application object, your Be program will invoke the BApplication Run() member\\nfunction:\\nmyApplication->Run();\\n\\nThe Run() function kicks off the message loop in the application\\'s main thread,\\nand then it begins processing messages. Not only is a call to this function important, it\\'s necessary; an application won\\'t start running until Run() is invoked.\\nA program\\'s application object is typically declared in main(), and is accessed by\\nthe global variable be_app outside of main(). So there\\'s really no need to have\\nthe application object reside in the heap--it can be on the stack. Here\\'s how the\\ncreation of the application object looks when done using a variable local to\\nmain():\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run ();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\nThis second technique is the way the application object will be created in this\\nbook, but you should be aware that you may encounter code that uses the first\\ntechnique.\\n\\nThe main() Routine\\nThe preceding pages introduced the C++ code you\\'ll write to create an application object and start an application running. One important question remains to be\\nanswered, though: where does this code go? Because the application object must\\nbe created immediately upon application launch (to establish a connection to the\\nApplication Server), it should be obvious that this code must appear very early in\\nthe program. A C++ program always begins its execution at the start of a routine\\nnamed main(), so it shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that it is in main() that you\\'ll\\nfind the above code. Here\\'s a look at a main() routine that is typical of a simple\\nBe application:\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nTo start a program, call Run(). When the user quits the program, Run() completes executing and the program ends. You\\'ll notice in the above snippet that\\nbetween Run() and return, there is no code. Yet the program won\\'t start and\\nthen immediately end. Here\\'s why. The creation of the application object (via the\\ndeclaration of the BApplication-derived object myApplication) initiates the\\nprogram\\'s main thread. When Run() is then called, the Run() function takes control of this main application thread. Run() sets up the main message loop in this\\nmain thread, and controls the loop and thread until the program terminates. That\\nis, once called, Run() executes until the program ends.\\n\\nThe SimpleApp Example Program\\nThe preceding pages have supplied you with all the code you need to write a Be\\napplication--albeit a very simple one. Because this same code (or slight variations\\nof it) will appear as a part of the source code for every Be program you write, I\\'ve\\ngone to great lengths to explain its purpose. In trying to make things perfectly\\nclear, I\\'ll admit that I\\'ve been a bit verbose--I\\'ve managed to take a relatively\\nsmall amount of starter code and spread it out over several pages. To return your\\nfocus to just how little code is needed to get a Be program started, I\\'ve packaged\\nthe preceding snippets into a single source code listing. When compiled and\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Fundamentals\\n\\n\\nlinked, this source code becomes an executable named SimpleApp. When\\nlaunched, the SimpleApp program displays a single, empty window like the one\\nshown in Figure 1-5.\\n\\nFigure 1-5. The window that results from running the SimpleApp program\\n\\nThe SimpleApp source code listing\\nPresented next, in its entirety, is the source code for a Be application named SimpleApp. As mentioned, all of the code you\\'re about to see has been presented and\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter.\\n#include <Window.h>\\n#include <Application.h>\\nclass SimpleWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nSimpleWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n};\\n\\nSimpleWindow::SimpleWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"A Simple Window\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nclass SimpleApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nSimpleApplication();\\n};\\n\\nSimpleApplication::SimpleApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-simpleapp\")\\n{\\nSimpleWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\naWindow = new SimpleWindow(aRect);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nmain()\\n{\\nSimpleApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nWhat the SimpleApp program does\\nWhen you launch SimpleApp you\\'ll see the window pictured in Figure 1-5. You\\ncan click the mouse button while the cursor is positioned over the zoom button in\\nthe window\\'s tab to expand the window to a size that fills most of your monitor.\\nClick the mouse button with the cursor again positioned over the window\\'s zoom\\nbutton and the window will return to its previous, much smaller, size. If you click\\nand hold the mouse button while the cursor is positioned over the window\\'s tab,\\nyou can drag the window about the monitor. Most important to this discussion is\\nthat the SimpleApp source code includes no code to handle such tasks. The zooming and moving of windows is handled by the system, not by the SimpleApp code.\\nThis simple demonstration emphasizes the power of the BeOS system software--it\\nis the system software code (rather than the application code) that supplies much\\nof the functionality of a program.\\nWhat the SimpleApp program doesn\\'t do\\nThere are a number of things SimpleApp doesn\\'t do--things you\\'d expect a \"real\"\\nBe application to do. Most notable of these omissions are menus, support of input\\nby way of controls in the window, and support of output via drawing or writing to\\nthe window. Of course these omissions will be rectified in the balance of this\\nbook. Starting, in fact, with the next chapter.\\n\\nBeOS Programming Environment\\nThe programming tool you\\'ll be using to create your Be applications is the BeIDE.\\nThis piece of software is an integrated development environment (IDE) and it runs\\non the Be operating system (so the origin of the name BeIDE is pretty evident!).\\nThe development of a new program entails the creation of a number of files\\nwhich, collectively, are often referred to as a project. Taking a look at an existing\\n\\x0cBeOS Programming Environment\\n\\n\\nproject is a good way to get an overview of the files that make up a project, and is\\nalso of benefit in understanding how these same files integrate with one another.\\nIn Chapter 2 I do just that. There you\\'ll see the HelloWorld example that\\'s the\\nmainstay of getting introduced to a new programming language or platform. In\\nthat chapter, you\\'ll also see how an existing project (such as HelloWorld) can be\\nused as the basis for an entirely new program. As a prelude to Chapter 2\\'s indepth coverage of this project, take a look at Figures 1-6 and 1-7.\\n\\nFigure 1-6. The files used in the development of the HelloWorld application\\n\\nThe /boot/apps/Metrowerks folder holds the BeIDE itself, along with other folders\\nthat hold supporting files and projects. Figure 1-6 shows the contents of a folder\\nthat holds two projects, both of which are used for building a standalone HelloWorld application. The project named HelloWorld_ppc.proj is used to build a Be\\napplication that executes on a PowerPC-based machine running the BeOS, while\\nthe project named HelloWorld_x86.proj is used to build a Be application that executes on an Intel-based PC. In Figure 1-6 you see that a project consists of a number of files. The filename extensions provide a hint of the types of files that make\\nup any one project. A file with an extension of:\\n.cpp\\nIs a C++ source code file\\n.h Is a header file that holds definitions used by certain C++ source code files\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 1: BeOS Programming Overview\\n\\n.rsrc\\nIs a resource file that holds resources that get merged with compiled source\\ncode\\n.proj\\nIs a project file that is used to organize the files used by the project\\nAlso shown in the HelloWorld folder in Figure 1-6 is a makefile--appropriately\\nnamed makefile. The BeIDE programming environment supports creation of programs from the command line. That is, you can supply the BeIDE compiler and\\nlinker with information by editing a makefile and then running that file from the\\nBeOS Terminal application. In this book I\\'ll forego the command-line approach to\\napplication development and instead rely on the BeIDE\\'s project-based model. As\\nyou\\'ll see in Chapter 2, creating a project file to serve as a means of organizing the\\nfiles used in a project takes full advantage of the Be graphical user interface.\\nFigure 1-7 shows the window that appears when you use the BeIDE to open the\\nproject file for the HelloWorld project.\\n\\nFigure 1-7. The project window for the HelloWorld project\\n\\nYou use a project file as a sort of command center for one project. From this one\\nwindow, you add and remove source code files, libraries, and resource files from\\nthe project. You can also double-click on a source code filename in the project\\nwindow to open, and then edit, that file. Using menu items from the File, Project,\\nand Window menus in the menubar of the project window, you can perform a\\nmyriad of commands--including compiling source code and building an application.\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Development\\nEnvironment File\\nOrganization\\n Examining an\\nExisting BeIDE\\nProject\\n Setting Up a New\\nBeIDE Project\\n HelloWorld Source\\nCode\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBeIDE Projects\\n\\nThe BeOS CD-ROM includes the BeIDE--Be\\'s integrated development environment (IDE) that\\'s used for creating Be applications. This programming environment consists of a number of folders and files, the most important of which are\\nmentioned in this chapter. In the early stages of your Be programming studies, the\\nfolder of perhaps the most interest is the one that holds sample code. Within this\\nfolder are a number of other folders, each holding a Be-supplied project. A project\\nis a collection of files that, when compiled, results in a single Be application. The\\nbest way to understand just what a project consists of is to take a long look at an\\nexisting Be project. That\\'s exactly what I do in this chapter.\\nAfter examining an existing project, you\\'ll of course want to create your own. A\\nlarge part of this chapter is devoted to the steps involved in doing that. Here you\\'ll\\nsee how to organize classes into header files and source code files, and how the\\nresource file fits into the scheme of things.\\n\\nDevelopment Environment File\\nOrganization\\nYou\\'ll find that an overview of how the many BeIDE items are organized will be\\nbeneficial as you look at existing BeIDE example projects and as you then start to\\nwrite your own BeOS program.\\n\\nThe BeIDE Folders\\nWhen the BeIDE is installed on your hard drive, the folders and files that make up\\nthis programming environment end up in a pair of folders named develop and\\napps on your boot drive.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nThe /boot/develop folder\\nIn the develop folder you\\'ll find folders that hold header files, libraries, and developer tools. Figure 2-1 shows the contents of the develop folder (on a PowerPCbased machine--a BeOS installation on an Intel-based machine results in one\\nadditional folder, the tools folder). This figure also shows the apps folder. The apps\\nfolder holds over a dozen items, though in Figure 2-1 you just see a single item\\n(the Metrowerks folder, discussed later).\\n\\nFigure 2-1. Some of the key folders and files used in BeOS programming\\n\\nIn the develop folder the lib folder holds a number of library files that can be\\nlinked to your own compiled code. The act of creating a BeIDE project (discussed\\nlater) automatically handles the adding of the basic libraries (libroot.so and libbe.so\\nat this writing) to the project. As a novice Be programmer, this automatic adding\\nof libraries to a new project is beneficial--it shields you from having to know the\\ndetails of the purpose of each library. As you become proficient at programming\\nfor the BeOS, though, you\\'ll be writing code that makes use of classes not\\nincluded in the basic libraries--so you\\'ll want to know more about the libraries\\nincluded in the develop/lib folder. Of course you could simply add libraries wholesale to a project to \"play it safe,\" but that tack would be a poor one--especially for\\nprogrammers developing BeOS applications that are to run on Intel machines. On\\nIntel, all libraries in a project will likely be linked during the building of an application--even if the program uses no code from one or more of the project\\'s libraries. The resulting application will then be unnecessarily large, or will include\\ndependencies on libraries that are not needed.\\nThe develop folder headers holds the header files that provide the BeIDE compiler\\nwith an interface to the software kits. Within the headers folder is a folder named\\nbe. Within that folder you\\'ll find one folder for each software kit. In any one of\\nthese folders are individual header files, each defining a class that is a part of one\\n\\x0cDevelopment Environment File Organization\\n\\n\\nkit. For instance, the BWindow class is declared in the Window.h header file in the\\ninterface folder. The complete path to that file is /boot/develop/headers/be/interface/Window.h.\\nThe etc folder in the develop folder contains additional developer tools. As of this\\nwriting, the primary component in this folder is files used by programmers who\\nprefer a makefile alternative to BeIDE projects. To build an application without\\ncreating a BeIDE project, copy the makefile template file from this folder to the\\nfolder that holds your source code files. Then edit the copied makefile to include\\nthe names of the files to compile and link. In this book, I\\'ll focus on the BeIDE\\nproject model, rather than the makefile approach, for creating an application.\\nThe tools folder in the develop folder is found only on Intel versions of the BeOS.\\nThis folder contains the x86 (Intel) compiling and linking tools and the debugger.\\nThe /boot/apps/Metrowerks folder\\nOf most interest in the /boot/apps folder is the Metrowerks folder. The BeIDE was\\noriginally an integrated development environment that was created and distributed by a company named Metrowerks. Be, Inc. has since taken over development and distribution of the BeIDE. Though Be now owns the BeIDE, installation\\nof the environment still ends up in a folder bearing Metrowerks\\' name.\\nIn the Metrowerks folder can be found the BeIDE application itself. The BeIDE is\\nthe Be integrated development environment--to develop an application, you\\nlaunch the BeIDE and then create a new project or open an existing one.\\nAlso in the Metrowerks folder are a number of subdirectories that hold various supporting files and tools. The plugins folder holds BeIDE plugins that enhance the\\ncapabilities of the BeIDE. The stationery folder contains the basic stationery used\\nin the creation of a new BeIDE project (stationery being a file that tells the BeIDE\\nwhich files (such as which libraries) to include, and what compiler and linker settings to use in a new project). The tools folder contains the compiler and linker\\n(on the PowerPC version of the BeOS) or links to the compiler and linker (on the\\nIntel version of the BeOS). On the PowerPC version of the BeOS, you\\'ll find a\\ncouple of other folders in the Metrowerks folder: the debugger folder (which holds\\nthe PowerPC debugger, of course) and the profiling folder (which holds some\\nPowerPC profiling tools).\\nThe sample-code folder\\nIncluded on the BeOS CD-ROM, but not automatically placed on your hard drive\\nduring the installation of the BeOS, is the sample-code folder. If you elected to\\nhave optional items included during the BeOS installation, this folder may be on\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nyour hard drive. Otherwise, look in the optional folder on the BeOS CD-ROM for\\nthe sample-code folder and manually copy it to your hard drive.\\nThe sample-code folder holds a number of Be-provided projects. Each project,\\nalong with the associated project files, is kept in its own folder. A Be application\\nstarts out as a number of files, including source code files, header files, and a\\nresource file (I have much more to say about each of these file types throughout\\nthis chapter).\\n\\nExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\nThe development of a new program entails the creation of a number of files collectively called a project. Taking a look at an existing project is a good way to get\\nan overview of the files that make up a project, and is also of benefit in understanding how these same files integrate with one another. Because my intent here\\nis to provide an overview of what a project consists of (as opposed to exploring\\nthe useful and exciting things that can be accomplished via the code within the\\nfiles of a project), I\\'ll stick to staid and familiar ground. On the next several pages\\nI look at the HelloWorld project.\\nYou\\'ve certainly encountered a version of the HelloWorld program--regardless of\\nyour programming background. The Be incarnation of the HelloWorld application\\nperforms as expected--the phrase \"Hello, World!\" is written to a window.\\nFigure 2-2 shows what is displayed on your screen when the HelloWorld program\\nis launched.\\n\\nFigure 2-2. The window displayed by the HelloWorld program\\n\\nYou may encounter a number of versions of the HelloWorld project--there\\'s one\\nin the sample-code folder, and you may uncover other incarnations on Be CDROMs or on the Internet. So that you can follow along with me, you might want to\\nuse the version I selected--it\\'s located in its own folder in the Chapter 2 folder of\\nexample projects. Figure 2-3 shows the contents of this book\\'s version of the HelloWorld folder.\\nAs shown in Figure 2-3, when developing a new application, the general practice\\nis to keep all of the project\\'s files in a single folder. To organize your own\\nprojects, you may want to create a new folder with a catchy name such as\\nmyProjects and store it in the /boot/home folder--as I\\'ve done in Figure 2-3. To\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-3. The files used in the development of a Be application\\n\\nbegin experimenting, you can copy this book\\'s HelloWorld example folder to your\\nown project folder. That way you\\'re sure to preserve the original, working version\\nof this example.\\n\\nProject File\\nA Be application developed using the BeIDE starts out as a project file. A project\\nfile groups and organizes the files that hold the code used for one project. By convention, a project file\\'s name has an extension of .proj. It\\'s general practice to give\\nthe project file the same name the application will have, with the addition of an\\nunderscore and then ppc for a PowerPC-based project or an underscore and then\\nx86 for an Intel-based project. In Figure 2-3, you can see that for the HelloWorld\\nproject there are two versions of the project file: HelloWorld_ppc.proj and\\nHelloWorld_x86.proj.\\nTo open a project file, you can either double-click on its icon or start the BeIDE\\napplication and choose Open from the File menu. In either case, select the project\\nthat\\'s appropriate for the platform you\\'re working on. When a project file is\\nopened, its contents are displayed in a project window. As shown in Figure 2-4, a\\nproject window\\'s contents consist of a list of files.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFigure 2-4. The project window for the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld project\\n\\nThe files listed in a project window are the files to be compiled and linked\\ntogether to form a single executable. This can be a combination of any number of\\nsource code, resource, and library files. The HelloWorld project window holds\\nthree source code files and one resource file, each of which is discussed in this\\nchapter. The project window also lists one or more libraries. The number of libraries varies depending on whether you\\'re working on a PowerPC version or an Intel\\nversion of a project. Figure 2-4 shows the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld\\nproject. In this project, the glue-noinit.a, init_term_dyn.o, and start_dyn.o libraries collectively make up the Be runtime support library that handles the dynamic\\nlinking code used by any Be application. An Intel project doesn\\'t list these libraries--they\\'re linked in automatically. The libroot.so library handles library management, all of the Kernel Kit, and the standard C library. The libnet.so library handles networking, while the libbe.so library is a shared library that contains the C++\\nclasses and the global C functions that encompass many of the other kits. An Intel\\nproject lists only the libbe.so library--the other two libraries are always automatically linked in. The Be kits hold the software that make up much of the BeOS, so\\nthis library is a part of the Be operating system rather than a file included with the\\nBeIDE environment.\\n\\nLibrary filenames will be prefaced with an indicator as to the\\nproject\\'s target platform (the platform on which the resulting application is to run). Figure 2-4 shows a project targeted for the PowerPC\\n(Power Macintosh or BeBox) platform.\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nProject activity is controlled from the Project menu located in the project window\\nmenubar. In Figure 2-5, you see that this menu is used to add files to and remove\\nfiles from a project. From this menu, you can compile a single file, build an application, and give a built application a test run. In the \"Setting Up a New BeIDE\\nProject\" section, you\\'ll make use of several of the menu items in the Project menu.\\n\\nFigure 2-5. The Project menu in the menubar of a BeIDE project window\\n\\nOf the many items in the Project menu, the Run/Debug item is the most important. Figure 2-5 shows that this bottom menu item is named Run--but this same\\nitem can instead take on the name Debug. When the menu item just above this\\none says Enable Debugger, then the Run/Debug item is in the Run mode. When\\nthe menu item just above instead says Disable Debugger, then the Run/Debug\\nitem is in the Debug mode. In either case, choosing Run or Debug causes all of\\nthe following to happen:\\n\\n\\nCompile all project files that have been changed since the last compilation\\n(which may be none, some, or all of the files in the project)\\n\\n\\n\\nLink together the resulting object code\\n\\n\\n\\nMerge the resource code from any resource files to the linked object code to\\nmake (build) an executable (an application)\\n\\n\\n\\nLaunch the resulting application in order for you to test it (if no compile or\\nlink errors occurred)\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nIf the Run/Debug menu is in Debug mode, then the last step in the above list\\ntakes place in the debugger. That is, the application is launched in the appropriate debugger (MWDebug-Be for PowerPC projects and bdb for Intel projects).\\nMany of the other items in the Project menu carry out a subset of the operations\\nthat are collectively performed by the Run/Debug item.\\nIf you haven\\'t compiled any Be source code yet, go ahead and give it a try now.\\nOpen the HelloWorld project file. To avoid the debugger during this first test,\\nmake sure the Project menu item just above the Run/Debug item says Enable\\nDebugger (select the item if it doesn\\'t say that). Now choose Run from the Project\\nmenu to compile the project\\'s code and run the resulting HelloWorld application.\\n\\nSource Code and Header Files\\nThe BeOS is a C++ application framework, so your source code will be written in\\nC++ and saved in source code files that have an extension of .cpp. To open an\\nexisting source code file that is a part of a project, double-click on the file\\'s name\\nin the project window. That\\'s what I did for the HelloWorld.cpp file that\\'s part of\\nthe HelloWorld project--the result is shown in Figure 2-6.\\n\\nFigure 2-6. The source code window for the HelloWorld.cpp source code file\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nMost of your code will be kept in source code files. Code that might be common\\nto more than one file may be saved to a header file with an extension of .h. While\\nyou can keep a project\\'s code in as few or as many source code and header files\\nas desired, you\\'ll want to follow the way Be does things in its examples.\\nProject file organization convention\\nBe example projects organize source code into files corresponding to a convention that\\'s common in object-oriented programming. The declaration, or specifier,\\nof an application-defined class exists in its own header file. The definitions, or\\nimplementations, of the member functions of this class are saved together in a single source code file. Both the header file and the source code file have the same\\nname as the class, with respective extensions of .h and .cpp.\\nThere\\'s one notable exception to this naming convention. A project usually\\nincludes a header file and source code file with the same name as the project (and\\nthus the same name as the application that will be built from the project). The\\nheader file holds the definition of the class derived from the BApplication class.\\nThe source code file holds the implementations of the member functions of this\\nBApplication-derived class, as well as the main() function.\\nFile organization and the HelloWorld project\\nNow let\\'s take a look at the HelloWorld project to see if it follows the above convention. Because this example is based on a project from Be, Inc., you can guess\\nthat it does, but you\\'ll want to bear with me just the same. The point here isn\\'t to\\nsee if the HelloWorld project follows the described system of organizing files, it\\'s\\nto examine an existing project to clarify the class/file relationship.\\nBack in Figure 2-4 you saw that the HelloWorld project window displays the\\nnames of three source code files: HelloView.cpp, HelloWindow.cpp, and HelloWorld.cpp. While it\\'s not obvious from the project window, there is also a\\nheader file that corresponds to each of these source code files (opening a source\\ncode file and looking at its #include directives reveals that information). According to the previous discussion, you\\'d expect that the HelloView.h file holds a listing for a class named HelloView. Here\\'s the code from that file:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloView.h\\nclass HelloView: public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nLooking at the code in the HelloView.cpp file, we\\'d expect to see the implementations of the three member functions declared in the HelloView class definition.\\nAnd we do:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloView.cpp\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAs you can see from the HelloView.cpp listing, I\\'m saving a little ink by not showing all of the code in the project\\'s files. Nor do I describe the code I do show.\\nHere I\\'m only interested in demonstrating the relationship between a project\\'s files\\nand the classes defined by that project. I do, however, take care of both of those\\nomissions at the end of this chapter in the \"HelloWorld Source Code\" section.\\n\\nI said I wouldn\\'t discuss the HelloWorld source code here. Out of\\ndecency to the very curious, though, I will make a few quick comments. You\\'re familiar with the SimpleApp example that was introduced in Chapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview. That example\\ndefined two classes. One was named SimpleWindow and was\\nderived from the BWindow class. It was used to display a window.\\nThe second class was named SimpleApplication and was derived\\nfrom the BApplication class. Every Be program needs to define\\nsuch a class. The HelloWorld example discussed here defines similar classes named HelloWindow and HelloApplication. It also\\ndefines a third class named HelloView, which is derived from the\\nBView class. Before writing or drawing to a window, a program\\nmust define a view--an area in the window to which drawing\\nshould be directed. The SimpleApp program didn\\'t draw to its window, so it didn\\'t need a class derived from the BView class.\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe second source code file shown in the project window in Figure 2-4 is HelloWindow.cpp. This file has a corresponding header file named HelloWindow.h. In\\nthis file we expect to find the declaration of a class named HelloWindow--and we\\ndo:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWindow.h\\nclass HelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nThe HelloWindow.cpp file contains the source code for the two HelloWindow\\nmember functions, HelloWindow() and QuitRequested():\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWindow.cpp\\n#include \"HelloWindow.h\"\\nHelloWindow::HelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW,\\nB_NOT_RESIZABLE | B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\nbool HelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nEarlier I stated that the header file that bears the name of the project should hold\\nthe declaration of the project\\'s application class--the class derived from the\\nBApplication class. Here you see that the HelloWorld.h header file does indeed\\nhold this declaration:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWorld.h\\nclass HelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nHelloApplication();\\n};\\n\\nThe source code file with the name of the project should hold the code for the\\nimplementation of the member functions of the application class as well as the\\nmain() function. HelloWorld.cpp does hold the following code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------// HelloWorld.cpp\\n#include \"HelloWindow.h\"\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#include \"HelloWorld.h\"\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\n...\\n...\\n\\n}\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nWhile I omitted the code that makes up the body of each member function of\\neach class in the HelloWorld project, you may still have picked up on similarities\\nbetween the HelloWorld source code and the source code of the Chapter 1 example, SimpleApp. In the section \"HelloWorld Source Code\" I point out all of the\\nsimilarities and discuss the differences.\\n\\nIn looking at existing source code, you may encounter a\\nBApplication constructor argument that\\'s four characters between\\nsingle quotes rather than a long, double-quoted MIME string. The\\nfour-character method is the old way of supplying a signature to an\\napplication, and is dated. The newer MIME string format is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\\n\\nResources and the Resource File\\nIt\\'s nice to sum up a programming concept in a single sentence, as in \"a pointer is\\na reference to a specific area in memory.\" Unfortunately, such conciseness isn\\'t\\nalways possible. Such is the case with the subject of resources. I\\'ll begin with a\\nshort summation--\"a resource is code that represents one element of a program\"--but adding clarity to that vague explanation necessitates a couple of paragraphs.\\nThe \"element of a program\" I speak of is usually thought of as one part, or entity,\\nof a program\\'s graphical user interface. For instance, some operating systems make\\nit easy to represent a window or menu as a resource. But a resource doesn\\'t have\\nto represent something graphical. For instance, an application\\'s signature--a short,\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nunique string that helps the operating system differentiate the application from all\\nother applications--is anything but graphical. Yet it can be a resource. While an\\napplication\\'s signature isn\\'t graphical in nature, the way in which it can be created\\nand edited can be thought of as graphical. For instance, one could imagine a simple editor that had a Create Application Signature menu item which, when\\nselected, displayed a text box in which a short string was typed. The editor would\\nthen be responsible for saving these typed characters as a resource. So it turns out\\nthat rather than representing something that is itself graphical, a resource is usually something that can be created and edited graphically.\\nBeing graphically editable is typically one trait that makes an element a candidate\\nto be represented by a resource. Since some programmer will have to design a\\nspecial editor that is capable of graphically editing a resource, another requirement is that the element be something common to most or all programs.\\nYou\\'ve just read that different program elements exist as resources for a variety of\\nreasons. An application\\'s icon is a good example. First, an icon is a small picture,\\nso it of course is an entity that lends itself to being easily edited graphically. Second, all applications have an icon that is used to represent the application on the\\ndesktop, so it made sense for someone to expend the effort to create an editor\\ncapable of editing icons. Finally, the BeOS needs the data that defines an application\\'s icon even when the application isn\\'t running, so that it can display the icon\\non the desktop at all times.\\nThere are different types of resources, and the BeOS keeps track of these different\\ntypes by using a different 32-bit integer for each resource type. As a convenience\\nto programmers, a four-character constant is often used to define this integer. Consider the icon that represents an application on the desktop. The data that defines\\nthis icon exists as a resource, and its type is `ICON.\\' Most programmers find it easier to remember the four-character constant `ICON\\' than the numerical value this\\nconstant represents.\\n\\nWhile a resource type is surrounded in single quotes in this book\\nand in Be documentation as well, the quotes aren\\'t a part of the\\nresource type--a resource type is simply the four characters (or an\\nactual 32-bit numerical value). The quotes are used only to make it\\nobvious that a resource type is being discussed. This is important\\nbecause a resource type can be in lowercase, and it can include a\\nspace or spaces. Placing an icon type in quotes sets it apart from the\\nrest of the text that appears with it.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nApplication-information resource\\nThere\\'s one other reason that a certain part of a program will exist as a resource--\\na reason unrelated to the graphical nature of the element or its ability to be edited\\ngraphically. Because of the way in which resources are stored in an executable,\\nresource information is available to the BeOS even when the application isn\\'t\\nrunning. The BeOS needs some information about an application in order to\\nbe able to effectively communicate with it. This information can be kept together\\nin a single resource of type `APPI\\' (for \"application information\") in the application. An `APPI\\' resource consists of the following pieces of information about an\\napplication:\\nLaunch Behavior\\nThe launch characteristics of a Be application can fall into one of three categories. Single launch is the typical behavior--no matter how many times a user\\ndouble-clicks on the application\\'s icon, only one instance of the executable is\\nloaded into memory and executed (that is, double-clicking on an application\\'s\\nicon a second time has no effect). It\\'s possible for two versions of a single\\nlaunch application to end up in memory if the user makes a duplicate of the\\noriginal executable and then double-clicks on each. Exclusive launch is a\\nbehavior that restricts this from occurring. Under no circumstance can two versions of a program execute at the same time. Multiple launch is a behavior\\nthat allows any number of instances of a single copy of a program to execute\\nsimultaneously.\\nBackground App\\nAn application can forego a user interface and run in the background only. If\\nan application is marked as a background app, it behaves in this way and\\nwon\\'t be named in the Deskbar.\\nArgv Only\\nAn application can be excluded from receiving messages from the BeOS (refer\\nto Chapter 1 for an introduction to messages). Marking an application as argv\\nonly means that the only information the application receives comes from the\\nargc and argv command-line arguments that can be optionally passed to the\\nprogram\\'s main() routine.\\nSignature\\nEach application has a string that lets the BeOS view the application as unique\\nfrom all others. Obviously, no two applications should share the same signature. For your own test programs, the signature you choose isn\\'t too important. Should you decide to distribute one of your applications to the Be community, though, you\\'ll want to put a little effort into selecting a signature. Be\\'s\\nrecommended format is \"application/x-vnd.VendorName-ApplicationName\".\\n\\x0cExamining an Existing BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nReplacing VendorName with your company\\'s name should provide a unique\\nsignature for your application.\\nHere I\\'ll look at `APPI\\' information for an existing project that already includes a\\nresource file. In this chapter\\'s \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section you\\'ll find\\ninformation on creating a resource file and editing its `APPI\\' information. To view\\nthe `APPI\\' information in a project\\'s resource file, double-click on its name in the\\nproject window. That launches the FileTypes application (which can also be\\nlaunched by choosing it from the preferences folder in the Be menu) and opens\\ntwo windows. Figure 2-7 shows the main window of FileTypes.\\n\\nFigure 2-7. The main FileTypes window\\n\\nTo view or edit an application\\'s `APPI\\' resource information, work in the second of\\nFileTypes\\' two windows. Figure 2-8 shows this window for the HelloWorld application.\\nThe application\\'s launch behavior is determined based on which of the three\\nLaunch radio buttons is on--Single Launch, Multiple Launch, or Exclusive Launch\\n(only one can be on at any given time).\\nWhether or not the application is a background app is determined by the status of\\nthe Background App checkbox. Whether or not the application is capable of\\nreceiving messages is determined by the status of the Argv Only checkbox. While\\nthese two items appear grouped together in the Application Flags area, they aren\\'t\\nrelated. Neither, either, or both can be checked at the same time.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFigure 2-8. Viewing the `APPI\\' information for the HelloWorld application\\n\\nAn application\\'s signature is based on the MIME string you enter in the signature\\nedit box of the FileTypes window. If a signature appears here, the string passed to\\nthe BApplication constructor will be ignored (refer to Chapter 1). If no signature appears here, the string passed to the BApplication constructor will be\\nused. Thus, by entering a string in the FileTypes window, you\\'re making the\\nBApplication constructor argument immaterial. Figure 2-8 shows the signature\\nfor the HelloWorld application used throughout this chapter.\\nIf you make any changes to a project\\'s resource file, save them by choosing Save\\nfrom the File menu of FileTypes (the File menu\\'s other item, Save into Resource\\nFile, is discussed in the \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section of this chapter).\\nIcon resource\\nAn icon could be described within source code (and, in the \"old days,\" that was in\\nfact how icons were described), but the specification of individual pixel colors in\\nsource code is difficult and tedious work. Rather than attempting to specify the\\ncolors of each pixel of an icon from within source code, a BeOS application\\'s icon\\ncan be created using a special graphical editor built into the FileTypes application.\\nThe graphical editor in FileTypes is used in a manner similar to the way you use a\\ngraphics paint program--you select a color from a palette of colors and then use a\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\npencil tool to click on individual pixels to designate that they take on that color.\\nSee Figure 2-9 to get an idea of what the graphical editor in FileTypes looks like.\\n\\nFigure 2-9. The icon editing window and palettes displayed by FileTypes\\n\\nIn FileTypes you simply draw the icon. You can then save the icon to a project\\'s\\nresource file so that each time an application is built from the project, your icon is\\nmerged with the application (and becomes the icon viewed on the desktop by the\\nuser). To view or edit the icon stored in the resource file of an existing project,\\nyou first double-click on the resource filename in the project window to open the\\nresource file. After FileTypes opens the resource file, double-click on the small\\nicon box located at the upper right of the FileTypes window; you\\'ll see the window shown in Figure 2-9.\\n\\nSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\nIn the previous section, you read that an application starts as a Be project. The Be\\nproject consists of a project file, source code files, header files, libraries, and\\na resource file. The project file itself doesn\\'t hold any code; it serves as a means to\\norganize all the other files in the project. The project file also serves as the project\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\n\"command center\" from which you compile code and build and test the executable. A close look at the HelloWorld project clarified many of these concepts.\\nWhen you set out to develop your own application, you\\'ll find that you may be\\nable to save some effort if you don\\'t start from scratch, but instead duplicate a\\nfolder that holds the files of an existing project. Consider this scenario: I want to\\ncreate a very simple children\\'s game--perhaps a tic-tac-toe game. I know that the\\nHelloWorld project results in a program that displays a single window and draws\\nto it. That represents a good part of what my game will need to do, so it makes\\nsense for me to base my game on the HelloWorld project, and then modify and\\nadd to the HelloWorld source code as needed. If your program will be a complex\\none, or one for which you can\\'t find a similar \"base\" program to start with, this\\napproach won\\'t be as fruitful. In such cases you\\'ll want to start with a new project.\\nIn this section, I\\'ll discuss each step of the process of setting up a new project first\\nin general terms. I\\'ll also carry out each step using the HelloWorld project to provide a specific example. So you see, I had good reason for devoting the previous\\nseveral pages to a look at the HelloWorld project. While I use the small HelloWorld project for simplicity, the steps discussed on the following pages apply\\njust as well to projects of a much larger scale.\\n\\nIn the above paragraphs, I refer to using code written by others.\\nBefore doing that you\\'ll of course want to make sure that you\\'re\\nallowed to do so! The BeOS CD-ROM comes with a number of\\nexample projects that fall into the category of projects that are available for your own personal use. The source code that makes up the\\nexample projects is copyright Be, Inc., but Be, Inc. has granted unrestricted permission for anyone to use and alter any of this source\\ncode. I\\'ve taken advantage of this fact and used these projects as the\\nbasis for the numerous examples that appear in this book. In turn,\\nyou\\'re free to use without restrictions the example code in this book\\nfor your own projects.\\n\\nThe following is an overview of the major steps you\\'ll carry out each time you create a new project. While on the surface it may appear that performing these steps\\ninvolves a lot of work, you\\'ll find that after you\\'ve set up a few new projects the\\nprocess becomes quite routine, and doesn\\'t take much time at all. All of the steps\\nare discussed in the sections that follow this list.\\n1. Find an existing project that is used to build a program that has similarities to\\nthe program you\\'re to develop.\\n2. Duplicate the existing project folder and its contents.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\n3. Open the new project folder and change the names of the project, source\\ncode, header, and resource files to names that reflect the nature of the project\\nyou\\'re working on.\\n4. Open the newly renamed project and drag the renamed source code files and\\nresource file from the folder and drop them into the project window.\\n5. Remove the now obsolete source code and resource filenames from the\\nproject window.\\n6. Edit the name of the constants in the #ifndef directive in the header files and\\nthe #includes in the source files.\\n7. Test the project\\'s code by building an application (here you\\'re verifying that\\nthe original source code is error-free before you start modifying it)\\n8. If there are library-related errors, create a new project (which will automatically include the most recent versions of each library) and add the source\\ncode files and resource file to the new project.\\n9. If there are compilation errors, correct the source code that caused the errors.\\n10. Open the header files and change application-defined class names in the\\nheader files to names that make sense for the project you\\'re working on.\\n11. Change all usage of application-defined class names in the source files to\\nmatch the changes you made in the header files.\\n12. Open the resource file using FileTypes and modify any of the `APPI\\' resource\\ninformation and the icon.\\n13. Set the name for the executable to be built.\\n14. Build a new application from the modified BeIDE project.\\nNo new functionality will have been added to the program that gets built from the\\nnew project--it will behave identically to the program that results from the original project. So why go through the above busy-work? Executing the above steps\\nresults in a new project that includes source code files that define and use classes\\nwith new names--names that make sense to you. This will be beneficial when you\\nstart the real work--implementing the functionality your new program requires.\\n\\nThe above list isn\\'t an iron-clad set of steps you must follow. Other\\nprogrammers have their own slightly (or, perhaps, very) different\\nguidelines they follow when starting a new project. If you\\'re new to\\nthe BeIDE, the BeOS, or both, though, you might want to follow my\\nsteps now. As you get comfortable with working in a project-based\\nprogramming environment, you can vary the steps to match your\\npreferred way of doing things.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nSelecting and Setting Up a Base Project\\nAs mentioned, you\\'ll get off to the best start in your programming endeavor by\\nfinding a project that matches the following criteria:\\n\\n\\nThe application that is built from the original project has several features common to the program you\\'re to develop.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou have access to the project and all its source code and resource files.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s made clear that the project\\'s source code can be modified and redistributed, or you have the developer\\'s permission to do so.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve found a project that meets the above conditions, you\\'ve performed\\nStep 1 from the previous section\\'s numbered list.\\nStep 2 involves creating a copy of the project folder and its contents. After doing\\nthat, rename the new folder to something appropriate for the project you\\'re\\nembarking upon. Usually a project folder has the same name that the final application that gets built from the project will have. Here I\\'m making a new project\\nbased on the HelloWorld project only for the sake of providing a specific example, so after duplicating the HelloWorld folder, I\\'ll simply change the name of the\\nfolder from HelloWorld copy to MyHelloWorld (each of these folders can be found\\nin the Chapter 2 examples folder available on the O\\'Reilly web site).\\nStep 3 is the renaming of the project-related files. Double-click on the new folder\\nto reveal its contents. Click on the name of any one of the header files and type a\\nnew name for the file. For my new MyHelloWorld project I\\'ll rename the HelloView.h, HelloWindow.h, and HelloWorld.h header files to MyHelloView.h, MyHelloWindow.h, and MyHelloWorld.h, respectively. Next, rename the source code files\\n(so, for example, HelloWorld.cpp becomes MyHelloWorld.cpp) and the resource\\nfile (here, from HelloWorld.rsrc to MyHelloWorld.rsrc). Now rename the project\\nfile. Again, choose a name appropriate to the project. Typically, the project file has\\nthe same name the application will have, with an extension of x86.proj or ppc.proj\\nadded. I\\'ll change the PowerPC version of the HelloWorld project by updating the\\nproject filename from HelloWorld_ppc.proj to MyHelloWorld_ppc.proj.\\nSteps 4 and 5 are performed to get the project to recognize the newly named files.\\nAfter the name changes are made, double-click on the project file to open it. The\\nproject window will appear on your screen. If you renamed a file from the desktop, the project file that includes that file will list it by its original, now invalid,\\nname. That necessitates adding the file by its new name and removing the original file from the project. To add the newly named files, select them from the desktop (click on each) and drag and drop them into the project window. In the\\nproject window, drag each to its appropriate group (for instance, place MyHelloWorld.cpp in the Sources group). To remove the original files from the project,\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nselect each and choose Remove Selected Items from the Project menu. For the\\nMyHelloWorld project, the resulting project window looks like the one shown in\\nFigure 2-10.\\n\\nFigure 2-10. The MyHelloWorld project window with renamed files in it\\n\\nTesting the Base Project\\nThe new project now has newly named files in it, but these files hold the code\\nfrom the original project. Before adding new functionality to the code, verify that it\\ncompiles without error (this is Step 7 from the previous list). Before compiling the\\ncode, though, perform Step 6--update the #includes at the top of each source\\ncode file so that they match the new names of the header files. For example, near\\nthe top of MyHelloView.cpp is this #include:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n\\nI\\'ve changed the HelloView.h header file to MyHelloView.h, so this #include\\nneeds to be edited. While I\\'m doing that, I\\'ll change HELLO_VIEW_H to the more\\nappropriate MY_HELLO_VIEW_H (though I could leave this as is--it\\'s simply a constant I define in the MyHelloView.h header file).\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n\\nBecause I changed the name of the constant HELLO_VIEW_H in the MyHelloView.\\ncpp source file, I need to change this same constant in the MyHelloView.h header\\nfile. Originally the header file contained this code:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nNow that code should look like this:\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\nFinally, test the code by choosing Run from the Project menu. Later, if you experience compilation errors after you\\'ve introduced changes to the original code,\\nyou\\'ll know that the errors are a direct result of your changes and not related to\\nproblems with the original code.\\nIf the building of an application is successful, Steps 8 and 9 are skipped. If the\\nattempt to build an application results in library-related errors (such as a library\\n\"file not found\" type of error), you\\'re probably working with a project created\\nunder a previous version of the BeIDE. The easiest way to get the proper libraries\\ninto a project is to follow Step 8--create a new project based on one of the Besupplied project stationeries. A new BeIDE project file can be created by choosing\\nNew Project from the File menu of an existing project. When you do that, the New\\nProject dialog box appears to let you choose a project stationery from which the\\nnew project is to be based. The project stationery is nothing more than a template\\nthat specifies which libraries and project settings are best suited for the type of\\nproject you\\'re creating. Here are definitions of the more important stationeries:\\nBeApp\\nStationery that links against the standard libraries applications need.\\nEverythingApp\\nStationery that links against all of the Be libraries.\\nKernelDriver\\nA basic template for writing a kernel driver.\\nSharedLib\\nStationery used to create a basic library or add-on, this links against the basic\\nBe libraries.\\nBeSTL\\nStationery used to create an application that includes the C++ standard libraries (including STL and the basic iostream functions).\\nIn Figure 2-11, I\\'m choosing the BeApp project stationery under the ppc heading in\\norder to create a project that\\'s set up to generate a Be application targeted for the\\nPowerPC platform (the list of project stationeries you see may differ depending on\\nthe version of the BeOS you\\'re using and the processor (PowerPC or Intel) in your\\nmachine). Note that when creating a new project you\\'ll want to uncheck the Create Folder checkbox in the New Project dialog box and specify that the new\\nproject end up in the folder that holds all the renamed files.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-11. Choosing a stationery on which to base a new project\\n\\nThe act of creating a new project doesn\\'t provide you with any source code files\\nor a resource file--you\\'ll need to repeat Step 4. That is, drag and drop the necessary files from the desktop folder to the new project window.\\nIf the building of an application results in compilation errors, now\\'s the time to\\ncorrect them. This is Step 9. Only after you successfully build an application does\\nit make sense to start making changes to the project\\'s source code.\\n\\nPreliminary Code Changes\\nYou\\'ll of course be making changes to the source code in the source code files.\\nThe most interesting of these changes will be the ones that turn the original code\\ninto code that results in an application that is distinctly your own. First, however,\\nyou need to make some preliminary source code changes. You\\'ve changed the\\nnames of the files, including the header files, so you\\'ll need to search for and\\nchange header file references in the source code files. You\\'ll also want to change\\nthe names of the classes already defined to match the names you\\'ve given to the\\nheader files.\\nHeader file code changes\\nStep 10 in the list of new project setup tasks is the changing of application-defined\\nclass names in the header files. Begin the changes by opening any one of the\\nheader files. The quickest way to do that is to click on the small arrow icon to the\\nright of one of the source code filenames in the project window. Doing that displays a menu that lists the header files included in the selected source code file.\\nTo open a header file, simply select it from this popup menu. With a header file\\nopen, make the following changes to the code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd the new name of the file to the file\\'s description comment section.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already done so, rename the application-defined constant that is\\nused in the #ifndef and #define preprocessor directives.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the file\\'s application-defined class.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the class constructor to match the new name you\\'ve give to the application-defined class.\\n\\nThe above steps are carried out in the same way regardless of the project you start\\nwith. To provide a specific example of how these changes are implemented, I\\'ll\\nchange the HelloView.h header file from the HelloWorld project. The following\\nlisting shows the original version of the HelloView.h file. Refer to it in the discussion that follows the listing.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------HelloView.h\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#ifndef _VIEW_H\\n#include <View.h>\\n#endif\\nclass HelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n#endif\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe first change to the header file, the altering of the file\\'s descriptive comment,\\nneeds little discussion. You may want to leave the original name intact as a courtesy to the original author. I\\'ve done that in the MyHelloView.h file (the listing of\\nwhich follows this discussion).\\nThe HELLO_VIEW_H constant is defined to eliminate the possibility of the code in\\nthis header file being included more than once in the same source code file. Earlier I changed its name to MY_HELLO_VIEW_H to reflect the new name I\\'ve given to\\nthis header file (MyHelloView.h):\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe _VIEW_H constant is a BeOS-defined constant (it\\'s used to ensure that the\\nBeOS header file View.h doesn\\'t get included multiple times) so it can be left as is.\\nIf you aren\\'t clear on the usage of the #ifndef preprocessor directive in Be files,\\nrefer to the \"Header Files and Preprocessor Directives\" sidebar.\\nThe original class defined in the HelloView.h file was named HelloView. I\\'ve\\nrenamed that class to MyHelloView to match the name I\\'ve given the header file. I\\nalso changed the name of the class constructor from HelloView() to\\nMyHelloView(). All of lines of code that include changes are shown in bold in\\nthe following listing of MyHelloView.h:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------MyHelloView.h\\nDan Parks Sydow\\nBased on source code from:\\nHelloView.h\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#ifndef _VIEW_H\\n#include <View.h>\\n#endif\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n#endif\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNotice that I\\'ve stopped short of making any substantial changes to the application-defined class. While you may be tempted to \"get going\" and start adding new\\nmember functions to a class, it\\'s best to wait. First, make all the name changes in\\nthe header files. Then update the source code files so that any usage of application-defined classes reflects the new names (that\\'s discussed next). Finally, verify\\nthat everything works by compiling the code. Only after you\\'re satisfied that all the\\npreliminaries are taken care of will you want to start making significant changes to\\nthe code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld project, I\\'d repeat the above process on the MyHelloWindow.h and MyHelloWorld.h header files.\\n\\nHeader Files and Preprocessor Directives\\nIn a large project that consists of numerous source code files and header files,\\nthe potential for a source code file to include the same header file more than\\nonce exists. Consider three files from a large project: source file S1.cpp and\\nincludes H2.h, then S1.cpp will include the code from H2.h twice (once directly\\nand once indirectly via H1.h). Such an event results in a compilation error that,\\ngiven the dependency of the files, can be difficult to remedy.\\nTo coordinate the inclusion of header file code in source code files, Be projects\\ntypically use the \"if not defined\" (#ifndef) preprocessor conditional directive\\nto define a constant in a header file and to check for the definition of that constant in a source code file. This is a standard technique used by many C and\\nC++ programmers--if you\\'re familiar with it, you can feel free to skip the\\nremainder of this sidebar.\\nA header file in a Be project begins by checking to see if a particular constant\\nis defined. If it isn\\'t defined, the header file defines it. Because all the remaining\\ncode in the header file lies between the #ifndef and the #endif directives,\\nif the constant is already defined, the entire contents of the header file are\\nskipped. Here\\'s that code from the HelloWorld project\\'s HelloView.h header\\nfile:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#define HELLO_VIEW_H\\n// class declaration\\n#endif\\n\\nBefore including a header file, a source code file checks to see if the constant\\ndefined in the header file is in fact defined. If it isn\\'t defined, the source code\\nfile does include the header file. Here\\'s that code from the HelloView.cpp\\nsource code file:\\n#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n\\n#endif source code file code changes\\nAfter you make the changes to the header files, it\\'s time to update the source code\\nfiles--this is Step 10 in the list of new project setup steps. Begin by double-clicking on one of the source code filenames in the project window. Then make the\\nfollowing changes to the code:\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd the new name of the file to the file\\'s description comment section.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename the application-defined constant that is used in the #ifndef and\\n#define preprocessor directives to match the renamed constant in the corresponding header file.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename any header filenames that follow #include directives to match the\\nrenamed header files.\\n\\n\\n\\nRename all occurrences of any application-defined classes to match the\\nrenamed classes in the other project header files.\\n\\nAs with header files changes, the source code file changes listed above apply to\\nany project. Again, I\\'ll use a file from the HelloWorld project to provide a specific\\nexample. The following listing shows the original version of the HelloView.cpp file:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------HelloView.cpp\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"HelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNext you\\'ll see the edited version of HelloView.cpp--it\\'s now the code for a file\\nnamed MyHelloView.cpp. Because there are no occurrences of any applicationdefined class names in the code in the bodies of any of the member functions, I\\'ve\\nomitted that code for brevity.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------MyHelloView.cpp\\nDan Parks Sydow\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nBased on source code from:\\nHelloView.cpp\\nCopyright 1995 Be Incorporated, All Rights Reserved.\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\nMyHelloView::MyHelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\n...\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThese steps need to be repeated for each source code file in the project. As you\\ndo that, note that a source code file may include occurrences of applicationdefined classes other than the class defined in the corresponding header file. Consider this snippet from the original HelloWorld.cpp file:\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\nHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\nHere you see that the constructor for the application-defined HelloApplication\\nclass declares variables of two different application-defined classes: HelloWindow\\nand HelloView. After renaming the HelloWorld.cpp file to MyHelloWorld.cpp, the\\nchanges to the above snippet would turn it into code that looks like this:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myworld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nThe astute reader will have noticed that I slipped an extra change in the above\\nsnippet. If you didn\\'t spot it, look at the parameter to the BApplication() constructor. Later in this chapter you\\'ll see that I also use the FileTypes application to\\nplace this same signature in the project\\'s resource file.\\nA quicker way to make the changes\\nYou may have found all this talk about manually editing header files and source\\ncode files a little disconcerting. Before your level of frustration rises too high, it\\'s\\ntime for me to make a confession. There is a shortcut to poring over page after\\npage of code to track down occurrences of class names that need to be changed--\\na shortcut I didn\\'t mention at the onset of the \"Preliminary Code Changes\" section. The BeIDE has a search and replace utility that makes finding and replacing\\nnames (such as constants and class names) a snap.\\nBefore discussing how to quickly make global changes to all of the files in a\\nproject, I\\'ll answer the one question that\\'s on your mind: Why did I bother with\\nthe drawn-out explanation of exactly what changes to make if everything could be\\ndone with a few mouse clicks? I went laboriously through all the changes so that\\nyou\\'d know what you\\'re changing and why.\\nNow, here\\'s a revised method for changing the names of constants, files, and\\nclasses that appear in the header files and source code files of a project:\\n1. Choose Open from the BeIDE main menu in the dock and open a header file.\\n2. Choose Find from the Search menu of the opened header file.\\n3. Set up the Find window to search the project\\'s source code files and header\\nfiles.\\n4. Enter a name to change in the Find box and the name to replace it with in the\\nReplace box of the Find window.\\n5. Click on the Find button in the Find window.\\n6. After verifying that the found text should indeed be replaced, click on the\\nReplace & Find button in the Find window.\\n7. Repeat Step 6 until all occurrences of the name have been found and\\nchanged.\\n8. Repeat Steps 4 though 8 for each name to be changed.\\nYou can speed things up by using the Replace All button once in place of the\\nReplace & Find button several times. However, it\\'s safer to use the Replace & Find\\nbutton so that you can take a quick look at each name the BeIDE is changing.\\nIf you want to perform a multiple-file search, the file icon located on the left side\\nof the Find window must be displaying two files and the Find window must be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nexpanded as shown in Figure 2-12. If the file icon is displaying a single file, click\\non the icon (it toggles between one and two files). If the Find window isn\\'t\\nexpanded (the Multi-File Search section won\\'t be visible), click on the small blue\\narrow located to the left of the file icon (the arrow expands and collapses the Find\\nwindow).\\n\\nFigure 2-12. The BeIDE Find window set up to search all of a project\\'s files\\n\\nWith the Find window set for multiple-file searching, specify which files are to be\\nincluded in a search. Check the Sources checkbox to designate that all of the\\nsource code files listed in the project window are to be searched. To specify that\\nthe header files also be included in the search, you\\'ll be tempted to check the\\nProject Headers checkbox. At this point, however, the BeIDE doesn\\'t know that\\nthe project source code files will be including the renamed header files--so it\\nwon\\'t know to add the desired files to the Multi-File Search list. Instead, click on\\nthe Others button. In the Select a File to Search window that appears, Shift-click\\non the names of each of the renamed header files. That is, hold down the Shift\\nkey and successively click the mouse button while the cursor is over each header\\nfilename in the window\\'s list of files. Click the Add button, then the Done button.\\nTo quickly change a name, enter the name to change in the Find box, enter the\\nnew name in the Replace box, and click the Replace All button. The BeIDE will\\nsearch all the project files for the name to find and replace each occurrence with\\nthe new name. For my MyHelloWorld project I began by searching for the constant HELLO_VIEW_H and replacing it with the new constant MY_HELLO_VIEW_H.\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nYou can see in Figure 2-12 that the Find window is set up to perform that act.\\nWhen done (it will only take a moment), enter another name and another new\\nname in the Find and Replace boxes and again click on the Replace All button.\\nRepeat these steps until all of the necessary changes have been made.\\nA click on the Replace All button quickly searches all of the files in a project and\\nreplaces all hits with new text. That makes the BeIDE Find facility a very powerful utility--too powerful if you aren\\'t sure what you\\'re changing. Hence my reasoning for describing this technique after the discussion on just what needs to be\\nchanged in the files of a project. Now, if you make a mistake that results in an\\nerror when you compile the project\\'s code, you\\'ll know where to look and what\\nto look for to remedy the errors.\\nTesting the changes\\nAfter making all the changes to a project, compile the code by choosing Make\\nfrom the Project menu in the project window\\'s menubar. This menu item compiles all touched files and then builds a new version of the application. A touched\\nfile is one that has been edited since the last time the file was compiled. Before\\nmoving on to the \"real\" code changes--the possibly extensive changes and additions you\\'ll be making to implement your program\\'s functionality--you\\'ll want to\\nverify that the \"cosmetic\" changes you\\'ve just made didn\\'t introduce any errors.\\n\\nEditing the Resource File\\nYou\\'ll want to give your application a unique signature and its own icon. The\\n`APPI\\' and `ICON\\' resources are both located in the project\\'s resource file, so the\\nFileTypes application is involved in both these acts.\\nChanging the signature\\nTo edit the signature to be merged with the application built from the new project,\\ndouble-click on project\\'s resource file. This launches the FileTypes application and\\nopens a window that holds `APPI\\' information (refer back to Figure 2-8 for an\\nexample). To complete Step 12 of the new project setup process, modify the\\n`APPI\\' information as needed. Most likely this will involve nothing more than\\nentering a new, unique signature to be assigned to the application that makes use\\nof the resource file. For the MyHelloWorld project, I changed the signature in the\\nMyHelloWorld.rsrc file to application/x-vnd.dps-myworld.\\nAfter changing the signature, you can choose Save from the File menu of the FileTypes window to save the change--but don\\'t close the window just yet.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nChanging the icon\\nTo modify the icon housed in the resource file, double-click on the icon box\\nlocated in the upper right corner of the Application Type window. Then draw\\naway. That, in brief, is the rest of Step 12.\\nThe Tracker--the software that allows you to work with files and launch applications in the BeOS--displays icons in one of two sizes: 32 pixels by 32 pixels or 16\\npixels by 16 pixels. The larger size is the more commonly used, but you\\'ve seen\\nthe smaller size on occasion. For example, the active application displays its\\nsmaller icon in the area you click on to reveal the items in the main menu. For\\neach icon resource, you\\'ll draw both the larger and smaller variants. At the top\\nright of the window back in Figure 2-9, you\\'ll see the editing area for both variants of the icon in the HelloWorld.rsrc file. Clicking on either icon displays an\\nenlarged, editable view of that icon in the editing area.\\nIn the top right area of the window, you\\'ll see a total of four actual-size icons. You\\ncan refer to these views to see how the 32-by-32 version and the 16-by-16 version\\nwill look on the desktop. There are two views of each sized icon to demonstrate\\nhow each looks normally and when selected (a selected icon has extra shading\\nadded by the BeOS).\\nYou\\'ll treat the large and small versions of an icon separately--editing one version has no effect on the other version. IconWorld will assign the larger version a\\nresource type of `ICON\\' and the smaller version a resource type of `MICN\\' (for\\n\"mini-icon\"). Because each icon has both a large and small version, IconWorld will\\nsave the two versions of the icon as a single unit.\\nYou\\'ll of course want to replace the original icon with one of your own creation.\\nTo do that, use the drawing tools and color palette to erase the old icon and draw\\na new one. Creating an icon in FileTypes is a lot like creating a small picture in a\\npaint program, so you\\'re on familiar ground here. If you aren\\'t artistically inclined,\\nat least draw a simple icon that distinguishes your program from the other program icons on your desktop. When done, click on the smaller editing area and\\nthen draw a smaller version of the icon. That\\'s what I did for the MyHelloWorld\\nexample I\\'m working on. I show off my creative abilities back in Figure 2-9.\\nIf you\\'re developing a program that will be distributed to others (rather than one\\nthat will be for your personal use only), you can find or hire someone else to\\ndraw a 32-pixel-by-32-pixel and a 16-pixel-by-16-pixel picture for you at a later\\ntime.\\nWhen you\\'re done with the new icon, choose Save from the File menu of the\\nIcon-O-Matic window, then close the Icon-O-Matic window. Now choose Save\\n\\x0cSetting Up a New BeIDE Project\\n\\n\\nfrom the File menu of the FileTypes window. Close the FileTypes window. This\\ncompletes Step 12.\\n\\nSetting Project Preferences\\nBesides keeping track of the files that hold what will become a program\\'s executable code, a project also keeps track of a variety of project settings. The font in\\nwhich source code is displayed and the types of compilation errors to be displayed are just two examples of project settings. There\\'s a good chance that most\\nof the copied project\\'s settings will be fine just as they are. You will, however,\\nwant to make one quick change. Step 13 specifies that you need to set the name\\nof the application about to be built--you do that in the Settings window.\\nTo display the project Settings window, choose Settings from the Window menu in\\nthe project file. On the left side of the window that appears is a list that holds a\\nvariety of settings categories. Click on the xxx Project item under the Project heading in this list (where xxx specifies the target, such as PPC for PowerPC). The Settings window responds by displaying several project-related items on the right side\\nof the window.\\nFrom the displayed items you\\'ll set the name that will be assigned to the application that gets built from the project. The MyHelloWorld project is used to build a\\nprogram that gets the name MyHelloWorld. Note that while the file type may look\\nlike a program signature (they\\'re both MIME strings), the two aren\\'t the same. The\\nfile type specifies the general type of file being created, such as a Be application.\\nThe file signature (assigned in the FileTypes window, as discussed earlier) gives an\\napplication a unique signature that differentiates the file from all other applications.\\nAfter changing the information in the File Name field, click the Save button. This is\\nthe only setting change you need to make, though you\\'re of course free to explore\\nthe Settings window by clicking on any of the other setting topics in the list.\\n\\nTesting the Changes\\nAfter making all your changes, you\\'ll want to test things out--that\\'s the last step in\\nmy list of how to create a new project. Choose Run from the Project menu in the\\nproject window\\'s menubar. This will cause the BeIDE to:\\n1. Compile any files that have been touched (altered) since the last build.\\n2. Link the compiled code to build an application.\\n3. Merge resources from the resource file with the built application.\\n4. Run the application.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nTo verify that your changes to the resource file were noted by the BeIDE, return to\\nthe desktop and look in your project folder. There you should find your new\\napplication, complete with its own icon. Figure 2-13 shows the MyHelloWorld\\nfolder as it looks after my test build of a PowerPC version of the program.\\n\\nFigure 2-13. The MyHelloWorld project folder after building an application\\n\\nThe MyHelloWorld folder in Figure 2-13 shows one folder and two files that I had\\nno hand in creating. The (Objects) folder holds, obviously enough, the object code\\nthat the BeIDE generated when compiling the project\\'s source code. The .xMAP\\nand .xSYM files were generated by the BeIDE during the building of the project\\'s\\napplication. The files in the (Objects) folder and the .xMAP and .xSYM files aren\\'t\\ndirectly of use to you--they\\'re used by the BeIDE during linking and debugging. If\\nI were working on a PC and did a build of an Intel version of the MyHelloWorld\\nprogram, my project folder would look a little different. There\\'d be no .xMAP or\\n.xSYM files, as these are PowerPC-only. Instead, the information in these files\\n(namely the symbol table and the debugging information for the application)\\nwould be contained in the ELF binary itself. There might also be a number of .d\\nfiles, which are temporary dependency files the compilers create (and which may\\nbe better disposed of in a future release of the BeOS).\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s Next?\\nAfter reading this section you know how to create a project that\\'s ready for your\\nown use. Now you need to make the source code changes and additions that will\\ncut the ties from the original project on which you\\'re basing your new program.\\nSo you need to know a lot more about writing BeOS code. The next section starts\\nyou in that direction, and the remainder of this book takes you the rest of the way.\\n\\nHelloWorld Source Code\\nIn the previous section, you saw that a new BeIDE project is usually based on an\\nexisting project. Once you have a mastery of BeOS programming, you\\'ll be able to\\nlook at existing projects and recognize which one or ones result in a program that\\nbears some similarity to the program you intend to develop. Until that time, it\\nmakes sense to use a small project such as the HelloWorld project as your starting\\npoint. If you follow my advice and do that, your new project will hold the\\nHelloWorld source code. You got a glimpse of some of that code earlier in this\\nchapter. Because you\\'ll be modifying the HelloWorld source code, you\\'ll find it\\nbeneficial to have a good understanding of that code. This section provides you\\nwith that.\\n\\nThe HelloWorld/SimpleApp/MyHelloWorld\\nConnection\\nThe HelloWorld project defines three classes: HelloView, HelloWindow, and\\nHelloApplication. Two of these classes, HelloWindow and HelloApplication, bear a strong resemblance to the SimpleWindow and SimpleApplication classes from the SimpleApp example that was introduced in\\nChapter 1. Actually, the opposite is true--the SimpleApp classes are based on the\\nHelloWorld classes.\\nTo create the SimpleApp project, I started with the HelloWorld project. I then followed this chapter\\'s steps for renaming the project files and renaming the application-defined classes. If you think that my following a Chapter 2 process while writing Chapter 1 was a good trick, just wait--there\\'s more! I then wrote SimpleApp\\nsuch that it became a simplified version of the HelloWorld program. Not many\\nbooks can lay claim to simplifying what is traditionally the most basic program that\\ncan be written for an operating system.\\nIn order to keep this book\\'s first example small and simple, I deleted the HelloView.cpp and HelloView.h files and removed any references to the class that was\\ndefined and implemented in those two files--the HelloView class. I also stripped\\nout the #ifndef and #define preprocessor directives to further simplify things.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nNow that the relationship between the Chapter 1 SimpleApp example project\\nand the Be-supplied HelloWorld project has been established, where does the\\nMyHelloWorld project fit in? As you saw in this chapter, the MyHelloWorld project\\nalso came about by duplicating the HelloWorld project. I renamed the files and the\\napplication-defined classes, but I left all the other code intact. Building an application from the MyHelloWorld project results in a program indistinguishable from\\nthe application that gets built from the HelloWorld project (except for the look of\\nthe application\\'s icon).\\nIn this section I describe the code that makes up the HelloWorld project. At the\\nend of this section I make a few minor changes to this code. When I do that I\\'ll\\nuse the MyHelloWorld project so that I can leave the original HelloWorld project\\nuntouched, and so that I can justify the time I invested in making the MyHelloWorld project!\\n\\nHelloWorld View Class\\nA view is a rectangular area in which drawing takes place. Drawing is an important part of almost all Be programs, so views are important too. Views are discussed at length in Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so I\\'ll spare you the\\ndetails here. I will, however, provide a summary of views so that you aren\\'t in the\\ndark until you reach the fourth chapter.\\nA view can encompass the entire content area of a window--but it doesn\\'t have\\nto. That is, a window\\'s content area can consist of a single view or it can be\\ndivided into two or more views. Note that a view has no visible frame, so when I\\nsay that a window can be divided, I\\'m referring to a conceptual division--the user\\nwon\\'t be aware of the areas occupied by views in a window.\\nA view serves as an independent graphics environment, or state. A view has its\\nown coordinate grid so that the location at which something is drawn in the view\\ncan be kept independent of other views that may be present in a window. A view\\nhas a large set of drawing characteristics associated with it, and keeps track of the\\ncurrent state of these characteristics. The font used to draw text in the view and\\nthe width of lines that are to be drawn in the view are two examples of these\\ncharacteristics.\\nThe information about a single view is stored in a view object, which is of the\\nBView class (or a class derived from the BView class). The BView class is a part of\\nthe Interface Kit.\\nWhen a window is created, it doesn\\'t initially have any views attached to (associated with) it. Because drawing always takes place in a view and never directly in a\\nwindow, any program that draws must define a class derived from the BView\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nclass. When the program creates a new window object, it will also create a new\\nBView-derived object and attach this view object to the Window object.\\nA class derived from the BView class will typically define a minimum of three virtual member functions. That is, such a class will override at least three of the many\\nBView member functions. These functions are the constructor function, the\\nAttachedToWindow() function, and the Draw() function. The HelloView class\\ndefined in the HelloWorld project does just that:\\nclass HelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\nThese member functions, along with several other BView member functions, are\\ndiscussed at length in Chapter 4. Here I\\'ll provide only a brief overview of each.\\nThe purpose of the constructor is to establish the size of the view and, optionally,\\nprovide a name for the view (NULL can be passed as the second parameter). If a\\nwindow is to have only a single view, then the first parameter to the constructor is\\na rectangle of the same size as the content area of the window the view is to be\\nattached to.\\nThe HelloView constructor does nothing more than invoke the BView class constructor. When a HelloView view object is created by the HelloWorld program,\\nthe program passes to the HelloView constructor the size and name the view is to\\nhave. The HelloView constructor will in turn pass that information on to the\\nBView constructor (as the rect and name parameters). The third BView constructor parameter describes how the view is to be resized as its window is resized.\\nThe Be constant B_FOLLOW_ALL sets the view to be resized in tandem with any\\nresizing of the window. The final BView constructor parameter determines the\\ntypes of notifications the view is to receive from the system. The Be constant\\nB_WILL_DRAW means that the view should be notified when the visible portions of\\nthe view change (and an update is thus necessary).\\nHelloView::HelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nYou might not be able to fully initialize a view object when creating it--some\\ncharacteristics of the view may be dependent on the window the view becomes\\nattached to. Thus the existence of the BView member function\\nAttachedToView(). This function is automatically called by the operating system\\nwhen the view is attached to a window (covered ahead in the discussion of the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\nHelloWorld\\'s application class). The characteristics of the view should be included\\nin the implementation of AttachedToWindow().\\nThe HelloView version of AttachedToWindow() sets the font and font size that\\nare to be used for any text drawing that takes place within the view:\\nvoid HelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nThe SetFont() and SetFontSize() functions are member functions of the\\nBView class. The function names make the purpose of each obvious, so I won\\'t\\noffer any more information here. You will, however, find plenty of information on\\ndrawing strings in Chapter 5, Drawing.\\nIn Chapter 1 you saw member functions invoked via an object--as in the\\nSimpleWindow object invoking the BWindow member function Show():\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nIn the AttachedToWindow() member function you see that the BView member\\nfunctions SetFont() and SetFontSize() are invoked without the use of an\\nobject.\\n\\nAs a C++ programmer, it should be obvious how a member function can be invoked in this way. If it isn\\'t, read on. The implementation of a member function results in a routine that can be invoked\\nby any object of the type of class to which the function belongs.\\nTherefore, the code that makes up a member function can operate\\non any number of objects. When a member function includes code\\nthat invokes a different member function (as the HelloView member function AttachedToWindow() invokes the BView member\\nfunction SetFont()), it is implicit that the invocation is acting on\\nthe current object. So no object prefaces the invocation.\\n\\nThe BView class includes a Draw() member function that automatically gets called\\nwhen the window a view is attached to needs updating. The system keeps track of\\nthe views that are attached to a window, and if more than one view object is\\nattached to a window, the Draw() function for each view object is invoked. The\\nDraw() function should implement the code that does the actual drawing in the\\nview.\\nThe HelloView version of Draw() simply establishes the starting position for drawing a string of text and then draws that string.\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nvoid HelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, World!\");\\n}\\n\\nHelloWorld Window Class\\nIn Chapter 1, you received an overview of the BWindow class and classes derived\\nfrom it, so I won\\'t go on at length about those topics here. In fact, I\\'ll barely discuss the HelloWindow class at all. If you need a refresher on defining a class\\nderived from BWindow, refer back to the SimpleApp example in Chapter 1--there\\nyou\\'ll find that the SimpleWindow class consists of the same two member functions (a constructor and the QuitRequested() function) as the HelloWindow\\nclass.\\nclass HelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nbool\\n\\nHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\nIn the SimpleApp project, the only thing the SimpleWindow class constructor does\\nis invoke the BWindow class constructor. That\\'s true for the HelloWindow class\\nconstructor as well. The first parameter to the BWindow constructor, which comes\\nfrom the HelloWindow constructor, sets the size of the window. The second\\nparameter is a string that is used as the window\\'s title. The SimpleWindow class\\npasses the string \"A Simple Window,\" while the HelloWindow class passes the\\nmore appropriate string \"Hello.\" The third parameter is a Be-defined constant that\\nspecifies the type of window to be displayed. The final parameter defines the\\nbehavior of the window. The SimpleWindow class passes the constant B_NOT_\\nRESIZABLE, while the HelloWindow class passes the result of combining two constants, B_NOT_RESIZABLE and B_NOT_ZOOMABLE.\\nHelloWindow::HelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE |\\nB_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nYou\\'ve already seen the code that makes up the QuitRequested() function. In\\nthe Chapter 1 SimpleApp project, I left this routine from the HelloWorld project\\nunchanged. Recall from that chapter that the purpose of overriding this BWindow\\nmember function is to cause a mouse click on a window\\'s close button to not only\\nclose the window, but to quit the application as well:\\nbool HelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nHelloWorld Application Class\\nAll programs must define a class derived from the BApplication class. Like the\\nSimpleApp\\'s SimpleApplication class, the HelloWorld\\'s HelloApplication\\nclass consists of just a constructor:\\nclass HelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nHelloApplication();\\n};\\n\\nFor the implementation of the SimpleApplication constructor, I started with the\\nHelloApplication constructor, then stripped out the view-related code. As you\\nlook at the HelloApplication constructor you should recognize much of the\\ncode:\\nHelloWindow\\n...\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\naRect;\\n\\naWindow = new HelloWindow(aRect);\\n...\\n...\\naWindow->Show();\\n\\nThis snippet begins by declaring a window variable and a rectangle variable. Next,\\nthe boundaries of the rectangle that sets the window\\'s size are established. Then a\\nnew window object (an object of the HelloWindow class) is created. Finally, the\\nBWindow member function Show() is invoked to display the new window. The\\ncode I omitted from the above snippet is the HelloApplication constructor\\'s\\nview-related code:\\nHelloView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new HelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\n\\nIn the above snippet, the size of the rectangle object isn\\'t changed, but its existing\\nboundaries (as set by the prior call to the BRect member function Set()) are offset. The one parameter in the BRect member function OffsetTo() is the location to move the upper-left corner of the rectangle to. The constant B_ORIGIN tells\\nOffsetTo() to shift the rectangle aRect from its present location such that its\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nupper-left corner aligns with the origin--the point (0, 0). This has the effect of\\ndetails of the coordinate system, by the way, are presented in Chapter 4. Next, a\\nnew HelloView object is created. The HelloView constructor sets the size of the\\nview to aRect and the name of the view to \"HelloView.\" Finally, the window\\nobject aWindow invokes the BWindow member function AddChild() to attach the\\nview to itself. Recall that in order for a view to be of use, it must be attached to a\\nwindow; in order for drawing to take place in a window, it must have a view\\nattached to it.\\nYou\\'ve seen the implementation of the HelloApplication constructor in bits and\\npieces. Here it is in its entirety:\\nHelloApplication::HelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.Be-HLWD\")\\n{\\nHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new HelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new HelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nYou may have noticed that after the window object is created, no drawing appears\\nto take place. Yet you know that the string \"Hello, World!\" gets drawn in the window. Recall that the updating of a window has the effect of calling the Draw()\\nmember function of any views attached to that window. When aWindow invokes\\nthe BWindow Show() member function, the window is displayed. That forces an\\nupdate to occur. That update, in turn, causes the aView object\\'s Draw() method\\nto be invoked. Look back at the implementation of the HelloView class Draw()\\nmember function to see that it is indeed this routine that draws the string.\\n\\nHelloWorld main() Function\\nWhen I wrote the main() routine for SimpleApp, the only changes I made to the\\nHelloWorld version of main() involved changing HelloApplication references\\nto SimpleApplication references. For the details of what main() does, refer\\nback to Chapter 1. I\\'ll summarize by saying that main() performs the mandatory\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\n\\ncreation of a new application object, then starts the program running by invoking\\nthe BApplication member function Run():\\nint\\n{\\n\\nmain()\\nHelloApplication\\n\\nmyApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication.Run();\\n}\\n\\nAltering the Source Code\\nTo implement the functionality required of your own program, you\\'ll no doubt\\nmake some changes and substantial additions to the code of whatever project you\\nstart with. After reading a few more chapters, you\\'ll know the details of how to\\ndraw just about anything to a window and how to add controls (such as buttons)\\nto a window. At that point you\\'ll be ready to make large-scale revisions of existing code. While at this early point in the book you may not feel ready to make\\nsweeping changes to Be code, you should be ready to make at least minor revisions. In this section, I\\'ll do that to the HelloWorld project.\\nI\\'ll leave the HelloWorld project intact and instead make the changes to a duplicate project--a project I\\'ve name MyHelloWorld. If you haven\\'t followed the steps\\nin this chapter\\'s \"Setting Up a New BeIDE Project\" section, do so now. Besides\\ngetting experience at starting a new project, you\\'ll bring yourself to the point\\nwhere you can follow along with the code changes I\\'m about to make. Here they\\nare:\\n\\n\\nChange the text that is drawn in the window\\n\\n\\n\\nChange the window\\'s title\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a zoom button to the window\\'s tab\\n\\n\\n\\nChange the size of the window\\n\\nAt the top of Figure 2-14, you see the original window from the HelloWorld program, while at the bottom of the figure you see the new window from the MyHelloWorld program.\\nThe drawing that takes place in the MyHelloWorld window is done by the\\nMyHelloView Draw() member function. A call to the BView member function\\nDrawString() writes the string \"Hello, World!\" to the window. Changing this one\\nDrawString() parameter to \"Hello, My World!\" will cause this new string to be\\ndrawn to the window instead. The affected line is in the MyHelloView.cpp file, and\\nis shown here in bold type:\\n\\x0cHelloWorld Source Code\\n\\n\\nFigure 2-14. The window from HelloWindow (top) and MyHelloWindow (bottom)\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect updateRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n}\\n\\nThe change to the window\\'s title and the addition of a zoom button to the window are both taken care of in the MyHelloWindow class constructor, so I\\'ll open\\nthe MyHelloWindow.cpp file. MyHelloWindow() invokes the BWindow constructor. The second parameter in the BWindow constructor defines the window\\'s title,\\nso changing that parameter from \"Hello\" to \"My Hello\" handles the window title\\nchange. The last parameter in BWindow() is a Be-defined constant, or combination of Be-defined constants, that defines the behavior of the window. In the original HelloWindow class, this parameter was a combination of the constants that\\nspecified that the window be drawn without a resize knob and without a zoom\\nbutton (B_NOT_RESIZABLE | B_NOT_ZOOMABLE). I\\'ll change this parameter to the\\none constant B_NOT_RESIZABLE so that a window created from the\\nMyHelloWindow class will be without a resize knob, but will now have a zoom\\nbutton:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe final change I\\'ll make to the code that came from the HelloWorld project will\\nchange the size of the program\\'s window. The MyHelloApplication constructor\\nuses a BRect object to define the size of the window, so I\\'ll go to this function in\\nthe MyHelloWorld.cpp file to make the change. In the following version of\\nMyHelloApplication(), I\\'ve changed the coordinates of the rectangle object\\nthat\\'s a little larger than the one used in the original HelloWorld program.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 2: BeIDE Projects\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myworld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(aRect, \"MyHelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nI can compile all the MyHelloWorld project files, build a new version of the\\nMyHelloWorld program, and run that program by choosing Run from the Project\\nmenu in the menubar of the MyHelloWorld project window. If I\\'ve done everything correctly, the program will display a window that looks like the one at the\\nbottom of Figure 2-14.\\n\\x0c\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Overview of the BeOS\\nSoftware Kits\\n Software Kit Class\\nDescriptions\\n Chapter Example:\\nAdding an Alert to\\nMyHelloWorld\\n3.\\n\\nBeOS API Overview\\n\\nWriting a Be application generally involves starting with an existing base of code\\nand then using several of the Be software kit classes to add new functionality to\\nthe base code. In Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects, you saw how to ready an existing\\nproject to serve as the base for your new project. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to\\nselect and use a software kit class to modify your new project.\\nThis chapter begins with an overview of the Be software kits. Knowing the purpose of each kit will help you quickly hone in on which kits will be of the most\\nuse in your project. After finding a kit of interest, you need to locate a useful class\\nwithin that kit. To do that, you\\'ll use the Be Book--the electronic document by\\nBe, Inc. that serves as the BeOS class reference. Once you\\'ve found a class of possible interest, you\\'ll read through the Be Book\\'s class description to find out all\\nabout the class: an overview of how objects are created, what they\\'re useful for,\\nand so forth. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to get the most out of the class\\ndescriptions in the Be Book.\\nThe Be Book is essential documentation for any Be programmer--but it isn\\'t a\\ntutorial. In this chapter, I close by looking at how the Be Book describes one class\\n(the BAlert class), and then go on to integrate an object of this class type in a\\nsimple program. The remaining chapters in this book provide example snippets\\nand programs that \"bring to life\" the class descriptions found in the Be Book.\\n\\nOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\nChapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview, provided a very brief description of each\\nkit--only a sentence or two. Because you hadn\\'t been exposed to any of the\\ndetails of BeOS programming at that point, out of necessity those descriptions\\ndidn\\'t give examples of kit classes and member functions. Now that you\\'ve\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nstudied the fundamentals of Be programming and have looked at some example\\nsource code, it\\'s time to rewrite the kit summaries, with an emphasis on the key\\nclasses and a few important member functions.\\nThe focus of this book is on the first three kits described below: the Application\\nKit, the Interface Kit, and the Storage Kit. Don\\'t feel as if you\\'re being shortchanged, though--these kits provide dozens of classes that allow you to create\\nfull-featured applications complete with windows, graphics, editable text, and all\\nmanner of controls.\\nWhile each of the software kits isn\\'t represented by its own chapter in this book,\\nall are at least briefly described below for the sake of completeness. A couple of\\nthe these kits can\\'t be covered, as they aren\\'t complete as of this writing. Be provides information on kit updates at the developer web page at http://www.be.com/\\ndevelopers, so you\\'ll want to check that site occasionally. Other kits are complete,\\nbut their specialized functionality makes detailed descriptions out of scope for this\\nbook. Note that while some kits don\\'t have a chapter devoted to them, some of\\ntheir classes appear throughout the book. See the description of the Support Kit\\nbelow for a specific example concerning the BLocker class.\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nThe classes of the Application Kit communicate with the Application Server and\\ndirectly with the kernel. Every program must create a single instance of a class\\nderived from the Application Kit class BApplication--the HelloWorld program\\nprovides an example of how this is typically done. This BApplication object is\\nnecessary for a couple of reasons. The application object:\\n\\n\\nMakes a connection to the Application Server. This connection is vital if the\\nprogram is to display and maintain windows, which of course most Be programs do.\\n\\n\\n\\nRuns the program\\'s main message loop. This loop provides a messaging system that keeps the program aware of events (such as a press of a keyboard\\nkey by the user).\\n\\nAn important member function of the BApplication class is Run(). The main()\\nfunction of every Be program must create an instance of the BApplication class\\nand then invoke Run() to start the program.\\nThe BApplication class is derived from two other Application Kit classes--\\nBLooper and BHandler. A BLooper object creates and then controls a message\\nloop, a thread that exits to transfer messages to objects. A BHandler object is one\\nthat is capable of receiving a message from a BLooper object--it handles a message received from a message loop. Because a BApplication object is also a\\n\\x0cOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\n\\n\\nBLooper and BHandler object, it acts as both a message loop and a message handler. Refer to Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1 for a look at the Application Kit class hierarchy that illustrates the relationship between the BApplication and BLooper and\\nBHandler classes.\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nWith over two dozen classes, the Interface Kit is the largest of the Be software kits.\\nIt\\'s also the one you\\'ll make the most use of--as will this book. The chapters from\\nChapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, through Chapter 8, Text, deal almost\\nexclusively with this kit. In Chapter 1 you saw that a window is an object derived\\nfrom an Interface Kit class--the BWindow class. In Chapter 2 you were introduced\\nto the concept that all drawing in a window is done via an object derived from\\nanother Interface Kit class--the BView class (much more on this important topic\\nappears in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, Drawing). In subsequent chapters you\\'ll learn\\nthat controls (such as buttons and checkboxes), strings, and menus are also types\\nof views (objects of classes that are derived from the BView class). Because all\\ndrawing takes place in a view, and because all of the aforementioned items are\\ndrawn, this should seem reasonable. It should also shed more light on the class\\nhierarchy of the Interface Kit, as shown in Figure 1-4 back in Chapter 1.\\nLike a BApplication object (see the Application Kit above), a BWindow object is\\nderived from both the BLooper and BHandler classes, so it is both an organizer\\nof messages in a message loop and a handler of messages. When an event is\\ndirected at a window (such as a mouse button click while the cursor is over a window\\'s close button), the system transfers a message to the window object\\'s thread.\\nBecause the window is a message handler as well as a message loop, it may also\\nbe able to handle the message.\\nA window contains one or more views--objects of the BView class or one of its\\nmany derived classes. Often a window has one view that is the same size as the\\ncontent area of the window (or larger than the content area of the window if it\\nincludes scrollbars). This view then serves as a holder of other views. These\\nsmaller, nested, views can consist of areas of the window that are to act independently of one another. Any one of these smaller views may also be used to display a single interface item, such as a button or a scrollbar. Because the contents\\nof a view are automatically redrawn when a window is updated, it makes sense\\nthat each interface item exists in its own view. Some of the Interface Kit control\\nclasses that are derived from the BView class (and which you\\'ll work with in\\nChapter 6, Controls and Messages) include BCheckBox, BRadioButton, and\\nBPictureButton.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nStorage Kit\\nAll operating systems provide file system capabilities--without them, data couldn\\'t\\nbe saved to disk. The Storage Kit defines classes that allow your program to store\\ndata to files, search through stored data, or both.\\nThe BNode class is used to create an object that represents data on a disk. The\\nBFile class is a subclass of BNode. A BFile object represents a file on disk. Creating a BFile object opens a file, while deleting the same object closes the file. A\\nBFile object is the mechanism for reading and writing a file. The BDirectory\\nclass is another subclass of BNode. A BDirectory object represents a folder, and\\nallows a program to walk through the folder\\'s contents and create new files in the\\nfolder.\\nThe concept of file attributes, associating extra information with a given file,\\nallows for powerful file indexing and searching. The BQuery class is used to perform searches.\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nThe Support Kit, as its name suggests, supports the other kits. This kit defines\\nsome datatypes, constants, and a few classes. While the nature of the classes of the\\nSupport Kit makes a chapter devoted to it impractical, you will nonetheless\\nencounter a couple of this kit\\'s classes throughout this book.\\nThe BArchivable class defines a basic interface for storing an object in a message and instantiating a copy of that object from the message.\\nThe BLocker class is used to limit program access to certain sections of code.\\nBecause the BeOS is multithreaded, there is the possibility that a program will\\nattempt to access data from two different threads simultaneously. If both threads\\nattempt to write to the same location, results will be unpredictable. To avoid this,\\nprograms use the Lock() and Unlock() member functions to protect code. Calls\\nto these functions are necessary only under certain circumstances. Throughout this\\nbook mention of the use of Lock() and Unlock() will appear where required.\\n\\nMedia Kit\\nThe Media Kit is designed to enable programs to work with audio and video data\\nin real time--the kit classes provide a means for processing audio and video data.\\nThe Media Kit relies on nodes--specialized objects that perform media-related\\ntasks. A node is always indirectly derived from the BMediaNode class, and there\\nare several basic node types. Examples are producer and consumer nodes. A producer node sends output to media buffers, which are then received by consumer\\nnodes.\\n\\x0cOverview of the BeOS Software Kits\\n\\n\\nMidi Kit\\nMIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a communication standard for representing musical data that is generated by digital musical devices. MIDI was created to define a way for computer software and electronic music equipment to\\nexchange information. The Midi Kit is a set of classes (such as BMidiPort) used\\nto assemble and disassemble MIDI messages. A MIDI message describes a musical\\nevent, such as the playing of a note. To make use of the Midi Kit classes, you\\'ll\\nneed to have prior knowledge of the MIDI software format.\\n\\nDevice Kit\\nThe Device Kit classes (such as BJoystick and BSerialPort) are used for the\\ncontrol of input and output devices and for the development of device drivers.\\nThese classes serve as interfaces to the ports on the back of a computer running\\nthe BeOS.\\n\\nNetwork Kit\\nThe Network Kit consists of a number of C functions. The C functions are global\\n(they can be used throughout your program), and exist to allow your program to\\ncommunicate with other computers using either the TCP or UDP protocols. One\\nsuch function is gethostbyname(), which is used to retrieve information about\\ncomputers attached to the user\\'s network.\\n\\nOpenGL Kit\\nOpenGL is a cross-platform application programming interface developed to facilitate the inclusion of interactive 2D and 3D graphics in computer programs. Introduced in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry standard for high-performance\\ngraphics. The OpenGL Kit contains classes that simplify the implementation of animation and three-dimensional modeling in your programs. The OpenGL Kit is one\\nof the newer BeOS kits, and is incomplete as of this writing. Working with the\\nOpenGL classes requires some previous experience with OpenGL.\\n\\nGame Kit\\nLike the OpenGL Kit, the Game Kit is incomplete. While it will eventually contain\\na number of classes that will aid in the development of games, at this time it\\nincludes just two classes. The BWindowScreen class is used by an application to\\ngain direct access to the screen in order to speed up the display of graphics. The\\nBDirectWindow class is an advanced class commonly used by game and media\\ndevelopers.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nKernel Kit\\nThe primary purpose of the C functions that make up the Kernel Kit is to support\\nthe use of threads. While the BeOS automatically spawns and controls many\\nthreads (such as the one resulting from the creation of a new window), your program can manually spawn and control its own threads. This kit includes classes\\nthat support semaphores for protecting information in the BeOS multithreaded\\nenvironment and shared memory areas for communicating between multiple\\nthreads and multiple applications.\\n\\nTranslation Kit\\nThe Translation Kit provides services that ease the work in translating data from\\none format to another. For instance, this kit could be used to translate the data in\\nan imported JPEG file into a BBitmap object (the BBitmap being a class defined in\\nthe Interface Kit) that your program could then manipulate.\\n\\nSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\nThe classes (and in a few cases, the C functions and structures) that make up the\\nBeOS software kits serve any imaginable programming need, yet they share many\\nsimilarities. Becoming familiar with what makes up a software kit class definition\\nand how Be documents such a class will help you make use of all of the software\\nkits.\\n\\nContents of a Class\\nA Be software kit consists of classes. Each class can consist of member functions,\\ndata members, and overloaded operators. While a kit class will always have member functions, it isn\\'t required to (and very often doesn\\'t) have any data members\\nor operators.\\nData members\\nC++ programmers are used to creating classes that define a number of data members and a number of member functions. In the first few chapters of this book,\\nthough, you\\'ve read little about data members in Be classes. If a Be class does\\ndefine data members, they are usually defined to be private rather than public.\\nThese private data members will be used within class member functions, but\\nwon\\'t be used directly by your program\\'s objects. That is, a data member generally exists for use in the implementation of the class rather than for direct use by\\nyour program--data members are thus of importance to a class, but they\\'re almost\\nnever of importance to you.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nYou can see an example of the data members of a Be class by perusing the Be\\nheader files. In Chapter 1 you saw a snippet that consisted of a part of the\\nBWindow class. In the following snippet I\\'ve again shown part of this class. Here,\\nhowever, I\\'ve included the private keyword and some of the approximately\\nthree dozen data members that are a part of this class.\\nclass BWindow : public BLooper {\\npublic:\\nBWindow(BRect frame,\\nconst char *title,\\nwindow_type type,\\nuint32 workspace = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE);\\n~BWindow();\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\n...\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nshort\\nport_id\\nport_id\\nBView\\nBView\\n...\\n}\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\nResizeBy(float dx, float dy);\\nResizeTo(float width, float height);\\nShow();\\nHide();\\nIsHidden() const;\\n\\n*fTitle;\\nserver_token;\\nfInUpdate;\\nf_active;\\nfShowLevel;\\nfFlags;\\nsend_port;\\nreceive_port;\\n*top_view;\\n*fFocus;\\n\\nMember functions\\nA class constructor and destructor are member functions, as are any class hook\\nfunctions. While the constructor, destructor, and hook functions are often\\ndescribed and discussed separately from other member functions, all fall into the\\ngeneral category of member functions, as shown in Figure 3-1.\\nFrom programming in C++ on other platforms, you\\'re familiar with constructors\\nand destructors. But you may not know about hook functions. A hook function is\\na member function that can be called directly by a program, but can also be (and\\nvery often is) invoked automatically by the system.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nSoftware Kit Class\\nData members\\nMember functions\\nHook functions\\nConstructor and destructor\\n\\nOther member functions\\n\\nOverloaded operators\\n\\nFigure 3-1. A kit class may consist of data members, member functions, and operators\\n\\nMany software kit class member functions are declared using the C++ keyword\\nvirtual. The most common reason for declaring a member function virtual is so\\nthat a derived class can override the function. Additionally, hook functions are\\ndeclared to be virtual for a second reason as well: your program may want to add\\nfunctionality to that which is already provided by the hook function.\\nWhen an application-defined class defines a member function, that function is typically invoked by an object created by the application. A hook function is also a\\nroutine defined by an application-defined class, but it is one that is invoked automatically by the software kit, not by an object. In order to be called by the system, a hook function must have a specific name that the system is aware of.\\nYou saw an example of a hook function in the SimpleApp example back in\\nChapter 1--the QuitRequested() function. When a window\\'s close button is\\nclicked on, the Be system automatically invokes a routine named\\nQuitRequested(). If the application has defined such a function in the BWindowderived class that the window object belongs to, it will be that member function\\nthat gets invoked. As a reminder, here\\'s the QuitRequested() function as defined\\nin the SimpleWindow class of the SimpleApp example:\\nbool SimpleWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nA hook function is so named because the function serves as a place where you\\ncan \"hook\" your own code onto that of the Be-written software kit code. By\\nimplementing a hook function, your application in essence extends the functionality of the Be operating system. The system is responsible for calling a hook function, while your application is responsible for defining the functionality of that\\nfunction.\\nOverloaded operators\\nAlong with member functions and data members, you may find overloaded operators in a Be class. A few classes overload some of the C++ operators, but most\\nclasses don\\'t overload any. You\\'ll find that the need for a class to overload operators is usually intuitive. For instance, the BRect class overloads the comparison\\noperator (==) so that it can be used to test for the equality of two rectangle\\nobjects. Because the comparison operator is defined in C++ such that it can be\\nused to compare one number to another, the BRect class needs to rewrite its definition so that it can be used to test all four coordinates of one rectangle to the four\\ncoordinates of another rectangle.\\nAs you just saw for the BRect class, if it makes sense for a class to redefine a C++\\noperator, it will. For most other classes, the use of operators with objects doesn\\'t\\nmake sense, so there\\'s no need to overload any. For instance, the BWindow and\\nBView classes with which you\\'re becoming familiar don\\'t included any overloaded operators. After all, it wouldn\\'t be easy to test if one window is \"equal\" to\\nanother window.\\n\\nClass Descriptions and the Be Book\\nThe definitive source of information for the many classes that make up the BeOS\\nsoftware kits is the Be class reference by the programmers of the BeOS. The electronic versions of this document (you\\'ll find it in both HTML and Acrobat formats)\\ngo by the name of the Be Book, while the printed version is titled The Be Developer\\'s Guide (available from O\\'Reilly). After programming the BeOS for awhile,\\nyou\\'ll find the Be Book or its printed version indispensable. But now, as you take\\nyour first steps in programming the BeOS, you may find the voluminous size and\\nthe reference style of this book intimidating. While this one thousand or so page\\ndocument is comprehensive and well-written, it is a class reference, not a BeOS\\nprogramming tutorial. When you have a solid understanding of how classes are\\ndescribed in the Be Book you\\'ll be able to use the Be Book in conjunction with\\nthis text if you wish.\\nThe Be Book is organized into chapters. With the exception of the first chapter,\\nwhich is a short introduction to the BeOS, each chapter describes the classes of\\none kit. Chapter 2 covers the classes of the Application Kit, Chapter 3 describes\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe classes that make up the Storage Kit, and so forth. Each class description in a\\nchapter is itself divided into up to six sections: Overview, Data Members, Hook\\nFunctions, Constructor and Destructor, Member Functions, and Operators. If any\\none of these six sections doesn\\'t apply to the class being described, it is omitted\\nfrom the class description. For instance, the BWindow class doesn\\'t overload any\\noperators, so its class description doesn\\'t include an Operators section.\\nThe following list provides explanations of what appears in each of the six sections that may be present in a class description in the Be Book. For each software\\nkit class, the sections will appear in the order listed below, though some of the\\nsections may be omitted:\\nOverview\\nA class description begins with an overview of the class. Such information as\\nthe purpose of the class, how objects of the class type are used, and related\\nclasses may be present in this section. The overview will generally be short,\\nbut for significant classes (such as BWindow and BView), it may be several\\npages in length.\\nData Members\\nThis section lists and describes any public and protected data members\\ndeclared by the class. If a class declares only private data members (which is\\nusually the case), this section is omitted.\\nHook Functions\\nIf any of the member functions of a class serve as hook functions, they will be\\nlisted and briefly described in this section. This section serves to summarize\\nthe purpose of the class hook functions--a more thorough description of each\\nhook function appears in the Member Functions section of the class description. Many classes don\\'t define any hook functions, so this section will be\\nomitted from a number of class descriptions.\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nA class constructor and destructor are described in this section. A few classes\\ndon\\'t define a destructor (objects of such class types know how to clean up\\nand delete themselves). In such cases, this section will be named Constructor\\nrather than Constructor and Destructor.\\nMember Functions\\nThis section provides a detailed description of each of the member functions\\nof a class, except the class constructor and destructor (which have their own\\nsection). While class hook functions have their own section, that section\\nserves mostly as a list of hook functions--the full descriptions of such functions appear here in Member Functions. Every class consists of at least one\\nmember function, so this section is always present in a class description.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nOperators\\nHere you\\'ll find a description of any C++ operators a class overloads. Most\\nclassed don\\'t overload any operators, so this section is frequently absent from\\na class description.\\n\\nA BeOS Class Description: The BRect Class\\nNow that you\\'ve had a general look at how a class description appears in the Be\\nBook, you\\'ll want to see a specific example. Here I\\'ll look at the Be Book description of the BRect class. Because this class doesn\\'t have any hook functions, the\\nHook Functions section is omitted from the Be Book\\'s class description. If you\\'d\\nlike to see a specific example of how a class implements hook functions, refer to\\nthe \"A BeOS Class Description: The BWindow Class\" section in this chapter.\\nAs you read these pages, you may want to follow along in the electronic version\\nof the Be Book. If you do, double-click on the Chapter 4 document and scroll to\\nthe start of the BRect class description.\\nOverview\\nThe Overview section of the BRect class description informs you what a BRect\\nobject is (a rectangle) and how a BRect object is represented (by defining four\\ncoordinates that specify where the corners of the rectangle are located).\\nNext in this section is the object\\'s general purpose (to serve as the simplest specification of a two-dimensional area) and a few specific examples of what such an\\nobject is used for (to specify the boundaries of windows, scrollbars, buttons, and\\nso on). The BRect overview then provides the details of how your specification of\\na rectangle object\\'s boundaries affects the rectangle\\'s placement in a view.\\nAs you read the overview, notice that no BRect data members or BRect member\\nfunctions are mentioned by name. This is typical of a class Overview section; what\\na class object is used for is covered, but details of how to implement this usage\\naren\\'t. Such details are found in the descriptions of the appropriate functions in\\nthe Member Functions section.\\nData Members\\nThe BRect class is one of the few software kit classes that declares public data\\nmembers. So it is one of the few classes that includes a Data Members section.\\nHere you\\'ll find the names and datatypes of the four public data members (they\\'re\\nnamed left, top, right, and bottom, and each is of type float). A singlesentence description accompanies the listing of each data member. The specifics\\nof how these data members are used by a BRect object appear in discussions of\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe BRect constructor and member functions in the Constructor and Member\\nFunctions sections.\\nHook Functions\\nThe BRect class defines several member functions, but none of them serves as a\\nhook function, so no Hook Functions section appears in the BRect class description.\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nFor the BRect class, this section is named Constructor rather than Constructor and\\nDestructor. There is no BRect destructor, which implies that a BRect object\\nknows how to delete itself. The BRect class is somewhat atypical of kit classes in\\nthat it is more like a primitive datatype (such as an int or float) than a class.\\nThe primitive datatypes serve as the foundation of C++, and in the BeOS the\\nBRect class serves a somewhat similar purpose; is the basic datatype that serves as\\nthe foundation of Be graphics. BRect objects are declared in the same way primitive datatype variables are declared--there\\'s no need to use the new operator.\\nThere\\'s also no need to use the delete operator to destroy such objects.\\nThe Constructor section reveals that there are four BRect constructors. One common method of creating a rectangle is to use the constructor that accepts the four\\nrectangle coordinates as its parameters. The remainder of the Constructor section\\nof the BRect class description provides example code that demonstrates how each\\nof the four BRect constructors can be used.\\n\\nEach of the four BRect constructor functions is declared using the\\ninline keyword. As a C++ programmer, you may have encountered inline functions. If you haven\\'t, here\\'s a brief summary of this\\ntype of routine. Normally, when a function is invoked, a number of\\nnon-routine instructions are executed. These instructions ensure that\\ncontrol is properly moved from the calling function to the called\\nfunction and then back to the calling function. The execution time\\nfor these extra instructions is slight, so their inclusion is seldom a\\nconcern. If it does become an issue, though, C++ provides a mechanism for eliminating them--the inline keyword. The upside to the\\nuse of the inline keyword is that execution time decreases slightly.\\nThe downside is that this reduced time is achieved by adding more\\ncode to the executable. Declaring a function inline tells the compiler to copy the body of the function to the location at which the\\nfunction is called. If the function is called several times in a program, then its code appears several times in the executable.\\n\\x0cSoftware Kit Class Descriptions\\n\\n\\nMember Functions\\nThis section lists each of the BRect member functions in alphabetical order. Along\\nwith the name and parameter list of any given function is a detailed description of\\nthe routine\\'s purpose and use. You\\'ve already seen one BRect member function\\nin action--the Set() function. In the Chapter 1 example, SimpleApp, a BRect\\nobject is created and assigned the values that define the rectangle used for the\\nboundaries of the SimpleApp program\\'s one window. The Member Functions section\\'s description of Set() states that the four parameters are used to assign values to the four BRect data members: left, top, right, and bottom.\\nOperators\\nThe BRect class overrides several C++ operators in order to redefine them so that\\nthey work with operations involving rectangles. In the Operators section, you see\\neach such operator listed, along with a description of how the overloaded operator is used. The operator you\\'ll use most often is probably the assignment operator (=). By C++ definition, this operator assigns a single number to a variable. Here\\nthe BRect class redefines the operator such that it assigns all four coordinates of\\none rectangle to the four coordinates of another rectangle. The Rect.h header file\\nprovides the implementation of the routine that redefines the assignment operator:\\ninline BRect &BRect::operator=(const BRect& from)\\n{\\nleft = from.left;\\ntop = from.top;\\nright = from.right;\\nbottom = from.bottom;\\nreturn *this;\\n}\\n\\nA BeOS Class Description: The BWindow Class\\nAfter reading the \"A BeOS Class Description: The BRect Class\" section of this chapter, you should have a good feel for how classes are described in the Be Book.\\nThe BRect class doesn\\'t include hook functions, though, so if you want to get a\\nlittle more information on this type of member function, read this section. The\\nBWindow class doesn\\'t define any public data members or overload any operators,\\nso you won\\'t find talk of a Data Members section or an Operators section here.\\nThe BRect class, however, does define public member functions and overload\\noperators. If you skipped the previous part, you may want to read it as well.\\nFollowing along in the Be Book isn\\'t a requirement, but it will be helpful. If you\\nhave access to the electronic version of the Be Book, double-click on the\\nChapter 4 document and scroll to the start of the BWindow class description.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nOverview\\nThe Overview section of the BWindow class description starts by telling you the\\noverall purpose of the BWindow class (to provide an application interface to windows) and the more specific purpose of this class (to enable one object to correspond to one window).\\nA class overview may mention other classes, kits, or servers that play a role in the\\nworkings of the described class. For instance, the BWindow overview mentions that\\nthe Application Server is responsible for allocating window memory and the\\nBView class makes drawing in a window possible.\\nBefore working with a class for the first time, you\\'ll want to read the Overview section to get, of course, an overview of what the class is all about. But you\\'ll also\\nwant to read the Overview section to pick up bits of information that may be of\\nvital interest to your use of the class. The BWindow overview, for instance, notes\\nthat there is a strong relationship between the BApplication class and the\\nBWindow class, and that a BApplication object must be created before the\\nfirst BWindow object is created. The overview also mentions that a newly created\\nBWindow object is hidden and must be shown using the Show() member function. You already knew these two facts from Chapter 1 of this book, but that chapter didn\\'t supply you with such useful information about each of the dozens of Be\\nsoftware kit classes!\\nData Members\\nLike most classes, the BWindow class doesn\\'t define any public data members, so\\nno Data Members section appears in the BWindow class description.\\nHook Functions\\nThe BWindow class has close to a dozen member functions that serve as hook\\nfunctions--routines that are invoked by the system rather than invoked by window objects. Here you find the names of the BWindow hook functions, along with\\na single-sentence description of each. A detailed description of each function,\\nalong with parameter types, appears in the Member Functions section.\\nMany of the short descriptions of the hook functions tell why the function can be\\nimplemented. For instance, the FrameMoved() hook function can be implemented to take note of the fact that a window has moved. Most programs won\\'t\\nhave to perform any special action if one of the windows is moved. If, however,\\nyour application does need to respond to a moved window, it can--thanks to the\\nFrameMoved() hook function. If your application implements a version of this\\nfunction, the movement of a window causes the system to automatically execute\\nyour program\\'s version of this routine.\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nConstructor and Destructor\\nSome classes have a constructor that includes a parameter whose value comes\\nfrom a Be-defined constant. In such cases the Be-defined constants will be listed\\nand described in the Constructor and Destructor section. For example, the third of\\nthe BWindow constructor\\'s several parameters has a value that comes from one of\\nseveral Be-defined constants. This window_type parameter specifies the type of\\nwindow to be created. Your application can use either the B_MODAL_WINDOW,\\nB_BORDERED_WINDOW, B_TITLED_WINDOW, or B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW constant in\\nthe creation of a BWindow object. In this Constructor and Destructor section you\\'ll\\nfind a description of each of these constants.\\nWhile a class destructor may be defined, objects of a kit class type often don\\'t\\nneed to explicitly call the object\\'s destructor when being destroyed. That\\'s because\\nthe BeOS does the work. The Constructor and Destructor section lets you know\\nwhen this is the case for a class. The BWindow class provides an example. As\\nstated in the Constructor and Destructor section of the BWindow class description,\\na BWindow object is destroyed by calling the BWindow member function Quit().\\nThis routine is responsible for using the delete operator on the window object and\\nthen invoking the BWindow destructor.\\nMember Functions\\nThis section describes each of the more than seventy member functions of the\\nBWindow class. You\\'ve worked with a couple of these routines, including the\\nShow() function, in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. If you look up Show() in the Member Functions, you\\'ll see that Show() is used to display a window--as you already\\nknow. Here you\\'ll also learn that this routine places the window in front of any\\nother windows and makes it the active window.\\nOperators\\nThe BWindow class doesn\\'t overload any C++ operators, so the Operators section is\\nomitted from the BWindow class description.\\n\\nChapter Example: Adding an Alert to\\nMyHelloWorld\\nEach remaining chapter in this book will include numerous code snippets that\\ndemonstrate the several topics presented in the chapter. The chapter will then\\nclose with the source code and a walk-through of a short but comprehensive\\nexample that exhibits many or all of the chapter topics. To keep new code to a\\nminimum and focus on only the new material presented in the chapter, each\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nexample program will be a modification of the MyHelloWorld program introduced in Chapter 2.\\nThis chapter provided an overview of the entire BeOS software kit layer, which\\nmakes including an example program relevant to the chapter a little difficult. Still,\\nI\\'d feel uncomfortable ending a chapter without at least a short exercise in adding\\ncode to a Be application! In this section, I first rearrange some of the code in the\\nMyHelloWorld listing to demonstrate that in Be programming--as in programming\\nfor any platform--there\\'s more than one means to accomplish the same goal. After\\nthat, I have the new version of MyHelloWorld open both its original window and\\na new alert by adding just a few lines of code to the MyHelloWorld.cpp listing.\\n\\nRevising MyHelloWorld\\nBy this point in your studies of Be programming, you should have enough of an\\nunderstanding of Be software kits, classes, and member functions that you feel\\ncomfortable making at least minimal changes to existing Be source code. While\\nyou\\'ll often start a new programming endeavor from an existing base of code,\\nyou\\'ll always need to adapt that code to make it fit your program\\'s needs. You\\nshould also be gaining enough of an understanding of Be code that you feel comfortable with the idea that there is more than one way to solve any programming\\ntask. As you look at the source code of existing Be applications, be aware that different programmers will write different code to achieve the same results.\\nIn this section I\\'ll rearrange some of the code in the MyHelloWindow.cpp and\\nMyHelloWorld.cpp source code files from the MyHelloWorld program introduced\\nin Chapter 2. Building a MyHelloWorld application from the modified listings will\\nresult in a program that behaves identically to the version built in Chapter 2.\\n\\nThe version of MyHelloWorld presented here will be used as the\\nbasis for each of the example programs in the remainder of this\\nbook. While there\\'s nothing tricky in the code presented here, you\\'ll\\nstill want to take a close look at it so that you can focus on only the\\nnew code that gets added in subsequent example programs.\\n\\nTwo approaches to achieving the same task\\nWhile I could just go ahead and make a few alterations for the sake of change, I\\'ll\\ninstead assume I have a valid reason for doing so! First, consider the Chapter 2\\nversion of MyHelloWorld. The MyHelloWindow class has a constructor that defines\\nan empty window. The MyHelloView class has a constructor that defines an\\nempty view and a Draw() member function that draws the string \"Hello, My\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nWorld!\" in that view. Recall that there is no connection between a window object\\ncreated from the MyHelloWindow class and a view object created from the\\nMyHelloView class until after the window object is created and the view object is\\nattached to it in the HelloApplication class constructor:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-myWorld\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\naRect.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(aRect, \"HelloView\");\\naWindow->AddChild(aView);\\naWindow->Show();\\n}\\n\\nThe above approach is a good one for a program that allows for the opening of\\nwindows that differ--two windows could use two different views. If MyHelloWorld defined a second view class, then a second window of the\\nMyHelloWindow class type could be opened and an object of this different view\\ncould be attached to it.\\nNow consider a program that allows multiple windows to open, but these windows are initially to be identical. An example of such an application might be a\\ngraphics program that opens windows that each have the same tool palette along\\none edge. The palette could be a view object that consists of a number of icon\\nbuttons. Here it would make sense to use an approach that differs from the above.\\nFor such a program the view could be attached to the window in the window\\nclass constructor. That is, the code that is used to create a view and attach it to a\\nwindow could be moved from the application constructor to the window constructor. If I were to use this approach for the MyHelloWorld program, the previously\\nempty constructor for the MyHelloWindow class would now look like this:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld program, the MyHelloApplication constructor would\\nnow hold less code, and would look like the version shown here:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nNow, when a new window is created in the application constructor, the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is responsible for creating a new view, adding the\\nview to the new window, and then displaying the new window.\\nThe new MyHelloWorld source code\\nChanging the MyHelloWorld program to use this new technique results in changes\\nto two files: MyHelloWindow.cpp and MyHelloWorld.cpp. Here\\'s how MyHelloWindow.cpp looks now:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef _APPLICATION_H\\n#include <Application.h>\\n#endif\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_VIEW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloView.h\"\\n#endif\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_WINDOW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWindow.h\"\\n#endif\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nThe MyHelloWorld.cpp file doesn\\'t get any new code--it only gets code removed.\\nHere\\'s the new version of MyHelloWorld.cpp:\\n// ----------------------------------------------------------#ifndef MY_HELLO_WINDOW_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWindow.h\"\\n#endif\\n// removed inclusion of MyHelloView.h header file\\n#ifndef MY_HELLO_WORLD_H\\n#include \"MyHelloWorld.h\"\\n#endif\\nmain()\\n{\\nMyHelloApplication *myApplication;\\nmyApplication = new MyHelloApplication();\\nmyApplication->Run();\\ndelete(myApplication);\\n}\\n\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\n// moved to MyHelloWindow constructor: MyHelloView variable declaration\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n// moved to MyHelloWindow constructor: the code to create view,\\n// attach it to window, and show window\\n}\\n// -----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs is the case for all of this book\\'s examples, you\\'ll find a folder that holds the\\nfiles for this new version of MyHelloWorld on the included CD-ROM. Make sure to\\ncompile and build an application from the project file to convince yourself that\\nthis latest version of the MyHelloWorld executable is the same as the Chapter 2\\nversion.\\n\\nAdding an Alert to HelloWorld\\nThe Interface Kit defines classes for the common interface elements. There\\'s the\\nBWindow class for a window, the BMenuBar class for a menubar, the BMenu class\\nfor a menu, the BMenuItem class for a menu item, and so forth. When you want to\\nadd an interface element to a program, you rely on an Interface Kit class to create\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nan object that represents that element. Consider a program that is to include an\\nalert. Armed with the above knowledge, it\\'s a pretty safe guess that the Interface\\nKit defines a BAlert class to ease the task of creating alerts.\\nThe BAlert class description\\nThe BAlert class is a simple one: it consists of a constructor and a handful of\\nmember functions. The following is the BAlert class definition (less its private\\ndata members, which you won\\'t use) from the Alert.h header file:\\nclass BAlert : public BWindow\\n{\\npublic:\\nBAlert(const char *title,\\nconst char *text,\\nconst char *button1,\\nconst char *button2 = NULL,\\nconst char *button3 = NULL,\\nbutton_width width = B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL,\\nalert_type type = B_INFO_ALERT);\\nvirtual\\n\\n~BAlert();\\n\\nBArchivable\\nstatus_t\\n\\nBAlert(BMessage *data);\\n*Instantiate(BMessage *data);\\nArchive(BMessage *data, bool deep = true) const;\\n\\nvoid\\nchar\\n\\nSetShortcut(int32 button_index, char key);\\nShortcut(int32 button_index) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nGo();\\nGo(BInvoker *invoker);\\n\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nBButton\\nBTextView\\n\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *an_event);\\nFrameResized(float new_width, float new_height);\\n*ButtonAt(int32 index) const;\\n*TextView() const;\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\n*ResolveSpecifier(BMessage *msg,\\nBMessage *specifier,\\nconst char *property);\\nGetSupportedSuites(BMessage *data);\\n\\nstatic\\n...\\n}\\n\\nBPoint\\n\\nAlertPosition(float width, float height);\\n\\nstatic\\nvirtual\\n\\nThe Overview section of the BAlert class description in the Be Book places\\nyou on familiar ground by letting you know that an alert is nothing more than\\na window with some text and one or more buttons in it. In fact, the overview\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nstates that you could forego the BAlert class altogether and use BWindow objects\\nin their place. You could do that, but you won\\'t want to. The BAlert class takes\\ncare of creating the alert window, establishing views within it, creating and displaying text and button objects in the alert, and displaying the alert upon creation.\\nThe Overview section tells you the two steps you need to take to display an alert:\\nconstruct a BAlert object using the new operator and the BAlert constructor,\\nthen invoke the Go() member function to display the new alert window.\\nThe Constructor section of the BAlert class description provides the details of the\\nvariable parameter list of the BAlert constructor. While the constructor can have\\nup to seven parameters, it can be invoked with fewer--only the first three parameters are required. Here\\'s the BAlert constructor:\\nBAlert(const char *title,\\nconst char *text,\\nconst char *button1,\\nconst char *button2 = NULL,\\nconst char *button3 = NULL,\\nbutton_width width = B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL,\\nalert_type type = B_INFO_ALERT);\\n\\nThe required parameters specify the alert\\'s title, its text, and a title for the alert\\'s\\nmandatory button. The first parameter is a string that represents the alert\\'s title.\\nWhile an alert doesn\\'t have a tab as an ordinary window does, a title is nonetheless required. The second parameter is a string that represents the text that is to\\nappear in the alert. The third parameter is a string (such as \"OK,\" \"Done,\" or\\n\"Accept\") that is to be used as the title of a button that appears in the alert. This\\nbutton is required so that the user has a means of dismissing the alert.\\nThe fourth through seventh parameters have default values assigned to them so\\nthat a call to the constructor can omit any or all of them. That is, an alert can be\\nconstructed by passing just three strings to the BAlert constructor--illustrated in\\nthis snippet:\\nBAlert\\n\\n*alert;\\n\\nalert = new BAlert(\"Alert\", \"Close the My Hello window to quit\", \"OK\");\\n\\nThe fourth and fifth parameters are optionally used for the text of up to two more\\nbuttons that will appear in the alert. The number of buttons in an alert varies\\ndepending on the number of strings passed to the BAlert constructor. By default,\\nthe second and third button titles are NULL, which tells BAlert to place only a single button in the alert. A Be-defined constant can be used as the sixth parameter\\nto BAlert(). This constant specifies the width of the alert\\'s buttons. By default,\\nthe width of each button will be a standard size (B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL) that is\\ncapable of holding most button titles. Providing a different constant here changes\\nthe width of each button. The final parameter specifies the icon to be displayed in\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 3: BeOS API Overview\\n\\nthe upper-left of the alert. By default a lowercase \"i\" (for \"information\") is used (as\\ndenoted by the Be-defined B_INFO_ALERT constant).\\nThe Alert program\\nIn the C03 folder on this book\\'s CD-ROM, you\\'ll find two folders: MyHelloWorld\\nand Alert. The MyHelloWorld folder holds the new version of the MyHelloWorld\\nproject--the version just described. The Alert folder also holds a version of the\\nMyHelloWorld project. The only difference between the two projects appears in\\nthe MyHelloApplication constructor in the MyHelloWorld.cpp file of the alert example. In the alert example, I\\'ve added four lines of code, shown in bold type here:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\\'myWD\\')\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nMyHelloView\\n*aView;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nBAlert\\n*alert;\\nlong\\nresult;\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nalert = new BAlert(\"\", \"Close the My Hello window to quit.\", \"OK\");\\nresult = alert->Go();\\n}\\n\\nThis latest incarnation of MyHelloWorld will serve as the base from\\nwhich the remainder of this book\\'s examples are built. To make it\\neasy to recognize the code that doesn\\'t change from example to\\nexample (which is most of the code), I won\\'t rename the files and\\nclasses for each example. That means you\\'ll always find the familiar\\nMyHelloView, MyHelloWindow, and HelloApplication classes. As\\nexhibited in the above snippet, the differences between one version\\nof MyHelloWorld and another will consist of minimal code changes\\nor additions. My goal in this book is to present short examples that\\nconsist mostly of existing, thoroughly discussed code, with only a\\nminimum amount of new code. The new code will be, of course,\\ncode that is pertinent to the topic at hand. To distinguish one\\nMyHelloWorld project from the next, I\\'ll simply rename the project\\nfolder to something descriptive of the example. For instance, the\\nalert example discussed here appears in a folder titled Alert.\\n\\nIn the above call to BAlert(), the first parameter is an empty string that represents the alert\\'s title. An alert doesn\\'t have a tab as a window does, but a title is\\nrequired. Passing an empty string suffices here. The second parameter is a string\\n\\x0cChapter Example: Adding an Alert to MyHelloWorld\\n\\n\\nthat represents the text that is to appear in the alert. While this trivial example\\nexists only to show how the alert code integrates into a program, I did want the\\nalert to have at least some bearing on the program--so I\\'ve made the alert serve as\\na means of letting the user know how to quit the program. The final parameter is\\nthe name that appears on the alert\\'s button. For a one-button alert, OK is typically\\nused. Figure 3-2 shows what the alert example program looks like when running.\\n\\nFigure 3-2. An alert overlapping a window\\n\\x0c\\nWindows, Views, and\\nMessages\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Windows\\n Views\\n Messaging\\n\\n4.\\n\\nA window serves as a program\\'s means of communicating with the user. In order\\nto provide information to a user, a window needs to be able to draw either text or\\ngraphics. And in order to receive information from a user, a window needs to be\\naware of user actions such as mouse button clicks or key presses. Views make\\nboth these modes of communication possible. All drawing takes place in views.\\nAnd views are recipients of messages that are transmitted from the Application\\nServer to the program in response to user actions. All three of these topics--windows, views, and messages--can be discussed individually, and this chapter does\\njust that. To be of real use, though, the interaction of these topics must be\\ndescribed; this chapter of course does that as well.\\n\\nWindows\\nYour program\\'s windows will be objects of a class, or classes, that your project\\nderives from the BWindow class. The BWindow class is one of many classes in the\\nInterface Kit--the largest of the Be kits. Most other Interface Kit class objects draw\\nto a window, so they expect a BWindow object to exist--they work in conjunction\\nwith the window object.\\nBecause it is a type of BLooper, a BWindow object runs in its own thread and runs\\nits own message loop. This loop is used to receive and respond to messages from\\nthe Application Server. In this chapter\\'s \"Messaging\" section, you\\'ll see how a window often delegates the handling of a message to one of the views present in the\\nwindow. The ever-present interaction of windows, views, and messages accounts\\nfor the combining of these three topics in this chapter.\\n\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nWindow Characteristics\\nA window\\'s characteristics--its size, screen location, and peripheral elements\\n(close button, zoom button, and so forth)--are all established in the constructor of\\nthe BWindow-derived class of the window.\\nBWindow constructor\\nA typical BWindow-derived class constructor is often empty:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe purpose of the constructor is to pass window size and window screen location on to the BWindow constructor. In this next snippet, this is done by invoking\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor, using the BRect parameter frame as the first\\nargument in the BWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBRect\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nIt is the BWindow constructor that does the work of creating a new window. The\\nfour BWindow constructor parameters allow you to specify the window\\'s:\\n\\n\\nSize and screen placement\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\nType or look\\n\\n\\n\\nBehavioral and peripheral elements\\n\\nThe BWindow constructor prototype, shown here, has four required parameters\\nand an optional fifth. Each of the five parameters is discussed following this prototype:\\nBWindow(BRect\\nconst char\\nwindow_type\\nulong\\nulong\\n\\nframe,\\n*title,\\ntype,\\nflags,\\nworkspaces = B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE)\\n\\nWindow size and location (frame argument)\\nThe first BWindow constructor parameter, frame, is a rectangle that defines both\\nthe size and screen location of the window. The rectangle\\'s coordinates are relative to the screen\\'s coordinates. The top left corner of the screen is point (0, 0),\\nand coordinate values increase when referring to a location downward or\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nrightward. For instance, the lower right corner of a 640  480 screen has a screen\\ncoordinate point of (639, 479). Because the initialization of a BRect variable is\\nspecified in the order left, top, right, bottom; the following declaration results in a\\nvariable that can be used to create a window that has a top left corner fifty pixels\\nfrom the top of the user\\'s screen and seventy pixels in from the left of that screen:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nThe width of the window based on frame is determined simply from the delta of\\nthe first and third BRect initialization parameters, while the height is the difference between the second and fourth. The above declaration results in a rectangle\\nthat could be used to generate a window 301 pixels wide by 201 pixels high. (The\\n\"extra\" pixel in each direction is the result of zero-based coordinate systems.)\\nThe frame coordinates specify the content area of a window--the window\\'s title\\ntab is not considered. For titled windows, you\\'ll want to use a top coordinate of at\\nleast 20 so that none of the window\\'s title tab ends up off the top of the user\\'s\\nscreen.\\nIf your program creates a window whose size depends on the dimensions of the\\nuser\\'s screen, make use of the BScreen class. A BScreen object holds information about one screen, and the BScreen member functions provide a means for\\nyour program to obtain information about this monitor. Invoking Frame(), for\\ninstance, returns a BRect that holds the coordinates of the user\\'s screen. This next\\nsnippet shows how this rectangle is used to determine the width of a monitor:\\nBScreen\\nBRect\\n\\nmainScreen(B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID);\\nscreenRect;\\nscreenWidth;\\n\\nscreenRect = mainScreen->Frame();\\nscreenWidth = screenRect.right - screenRect.left;\\n\\nAs of this writing, the BeOS supports only a single monitor, but the above snippet\\nanticipates that this will change. The Be-defined constant B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID is\\nused to create an object that represents the user\\'s main monitor (the monitor that\\ndisplays the Deskbar). Additionally, the width of the screen can be determined by\\nsubtracting the left coordinate from the right, and the height by subtracting the top\\nfrom the bottom. On the main monitor, the left and top fields of the BRect\\nreturned by Frame() are 0, so the right and bottom fields provide the width\\nand height of this screen. When an additional monitor is added, though, the left\\nand top fields will be non-zero; they\\'ll pick up where the main screen \"ends.\"\\nWindow title\\nThe second BWindow constructor argument, title, establishes the title that is to\\nappear in the window\\'s tab. If the window won\\'t display a tab, this parameter\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nvalue is unimportant--you can pass NULL or an empty string (\"\") here (though\\nyou may want to include a name in case your program may eventually access the\\nwindow through scripting.\\nWindow type\\nThe third BWindow constructor parameter, type, defines the style of window to be\\ncreated. Here you use one of five Be-defined constants:\\nB_DOCUMENT_WINDOW\\nIs the most common type, and creates a nonmodal window that has a title tab.\\nAdditionally, the window has right and bottom borders that are thinner than\\nthe border on its other two sides. This narrower border is designed to integrate well with the scrollbars that may be present in such a window.\\nB_TITLED_WINDOW\\nResults in a nonmodal window that has a title tab.\\nB_MODAL_WINDOW\\nCreates a modal window, a window that prevents other application activity\\nuntil it is dismissed. Such a window is also referred to as a dialog box. A window of this type has no title tab.\\nB_BORDERED_WINDOW\\nCreates a nonmodal window that has no title tab.\\nB_FLOATING_WINDOW\\nCreates a window that floats above (won\\'t be obscured by) other application\\nwindows.\\n\\nThere\\'s another version of the BWindow constructor that has two\\nparameters (look and feel) in place of the one type parameter discussed above. The separate look and feel parameters provide a\\nmeans of more concisely stating just how a window is to look and\\nbehave. The single type parameter can be thought of as a shorthand\\nnotation that encapsulates both these descriptions. Refer to the\\nBWindow class section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for\\nmore details (and a list of Be-defined look and feel constants).\\n\\nWindow behavior and elements\\nThe fourth BWindow constructor argument, flags, determines a window\\'s behavior (such as whether the window is movable) and the window\\'s peripheral elements (such as the presence of a title tab or zoom button). There are a number of\\nBe-defined constants that can be used singly or in any combination to achieve the\\ndesired window properties. To use more than a single constant, list each and\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nseparate them with the OR (|) operator. The following example demonstrates how\\nto create a window that has no zoom button or close button:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, windowName, B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE | B_NOT_\\nCLOSABLE)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nIf you use 0 (zero) as the fourth parameter, it serves as a shortcut for specifying\\nthat a window include all the characteristics expected of a titled window. Default\\nwindows are movable, resizable, and have close and zoom buttons:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n:BWindow(frame, windowName, B_TITLED_WINDOW, 0)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe following briefly describes many of the several Be-defined constants available\\nfor use as the fourth parameter in the BWindow constructor:\\nB_NOT_MOVABLE\\nCreates a window that cannot be moved--even if the window has a title tab.\\nBy default, a window with a title tab is movable.\\nB_NOT_H_RESIZABLE\\nGenerates a window that can\\'t be resized horizontally. By default, a window\\ncan be resized both horizontally and vertically.\\nB_NOT_V_RESIZABLE\\nGenerates a window that can\\'t be resized vertically. By default, a window can\\nbe resized both horizontally and vertically.\\nB_NOT_RESIZABLE\\nCreates a window that cannot be resized horizontally or vertically.\\nB_NOT_CLOSABLE\\nResults in a window that has no close button. By default, a window with a\\ntitle tab has a close button.\\nB_NOT_ZOOMABLE\\nResults in a window that has no zoom box. By default, a window with a title\\ntab has a zoom box.\\nB_NOT_MINIMIZABLE\\nDefines a window that cannot be minimized (collapsed). By default, a window can be minimized by double-clicking on the window\\'s title bar.\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nB_WILL_ACCEPT_FIRST_CLICK\\nResults in a window that is aware of mouse button clicks in it--even when the\\nwindow isn\\'t frontmost. By default, a window is aware only of mouse button\\nclicks that occur when the window is the frontmost, or active, window.\\nWorkspace\\nThe BWindow constructor has an optional fifth parameter, workspaces, that specifies which workspace or workspaces should contain the new window. Desktop\\ninformation such as screen resolution and color depth (number of bits of color\\ndata per pixel) can be adjusted by the user. Different configurations can be saved\\nto different workspaces. Workspaces can be thought of as virtual monitors to\\nwhich the user can switch. Under different circumstances, a user may wish to display different types of desktops. By omitting this parameter, you tell the BWindow\\nconstructor to use the default Be-defined constant B_CURRENT_WORKSPACE. Doing\\nso means the window will show up in whatever workspace is currently selected\\nby the user. To create a window that appears in all of the user\\'s workspaces, use\\nthe Be-defined constant B_ALL_WORKSPACES as the fifth parameter to the BWindow\\nconstructor.\\n\\nYou can find out more about workspaces from the user\\'s perspective in the BeOS User\\'s Guide, and from the programmer\\'s perspective in the BWindow constructor section of the Interface Kit\\nchapter of the Be Book.\\n\\nAccessing Windows\\nFortunately for you, the programmer, the Be operating system takes care of much\\nof the work in keeping track of your application\\'s windows and the user\\'s actions\\nthat affect those windows. There will be times, however, when you\\'ll need to\\ndirectly manipulate one or all of your program\\'s windows. For instance, you may\\nwant to access the frontmost window to draw to it, or access all open windows to\\nimplement a Close All menu item.\\nThe Application Server keeps a list that holds references to an application\\'s open\\nwindows. The list indices begin at 0, and continue integrally. The windows aren\\'t\\nentered in this list in any predefined order, so you can\\'t rely on a particular index\\nreferencing a particular window. You can, however, use the BApplication member function WindowAt() to find any given window.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nAccessing a window using WindowAt()\\nWindowAt() accepts a single argument, an integer that serves as a window list\\nindex. Calling WindowAt() returns the BWindow object this index references. A\\ncall to WindowAt() returns the first window in the list:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*aWindow;\\n\\naWindow = be_app->WindowAt(0);\\n\\nFrom Chapter 1, BeOS Programming Overview, you know that the Be-defined global variable be_app always points to the active application, so you can use it anywhere in your code to invoke a BApplication member function such as\\nWindowAt().\\nWhen WindowAt() is passed a value that is an out-of-bounds index, the routine\\nreturns NULL. You can use this fact to create a simple loop that accesses each\\nopen window:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*theWindow;\\ni = 0;\\n\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\n// do something, such as close theWindow\\n}\\n\\nThe preceding loop starts at window 0 in the window list and continues until the\\nlast window in the list is reached.\\nA good use for the WindowAt() loop is to determine the frontmost window. The\\nBWindow member function IsFront() returns a bool (Boolean) value that indicates whether a window is frontmost. If you set up a loop to cycle through each\\nopen window and invoke IsFront() for each returned window, the frontmost\\nwindow will eventually be encountered:\\nBWindow\\nBWindow\\n\\n*theWindow;\\n*frontWindow = NULL;\\ni = 0;\\n\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nif (theWindow->IsFront())\\nfrontWindow = theWindow;\\n}\\n\\nIn the preceding snippet, note that frontWindow is initialized to NULL. If no windows are open when the loop runs, frontWindow will retain the value of NULL,\\nproperly indicating that no window is frontmost.\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nFrontmost window routine\\nWith the exception of main(), all the functions you\\'ve encountered to this point\\nhave been part of the BeOS API--they\\'ve all been Be-defined member functions\\nof Be-defined classes. Your nontrivial projects will also include application-defined\\nmember functions, either in classes you define from scratch or in classes you\\nderive from a Be-defined class. Here I provide an example of this second category of application-defined routine. The MyHelloApplication class is derived\\nfrom the Be-defined BApplication class. This version of MyHelloApplication\\nadds a new application-defined routine to the class declaration:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nBWindow *\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nGetFrontWindow();\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe function implementation is familiar to you--it\\'s based on the previous snippet that included a loop that repeatedly calls AtWindow():\\nBWindow * MyHelloApplication::GetFrontWindow()\\n{\\nBWindow *theWindow;\\nBWindow *frontWindow = NULL;\\ni = 0;\\nwhile (theWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nif (theWindow->IsFront())\\nfrontWindow = theWindow;\\n}\\nreturn frontWindow;\\n}\\n\\nWhen execution of GetFrontWindow() ends, the routine returns the BWindow\\nobject that is the frontmost window. Before using the returned window, typecast it\\nto the BWindow-derived class that matches its actual type, as in:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\n\\nWith access to the frontmost window attained, any BWindow member function can\\nbe invoked to perform some action on the window. Here I call the BWindow member function MoveBy() to make the frontmost window jump down and to the\\nright 100 pixels in each direction:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nFrontmost window example project\\nI\\'ve taken the preceding GetFrontWindow() routine and included it in a new version of MyHelloWorld. To test out the function, I open three MyHelloWorld windows, one directly on top of another. Then I call GetFrontWindow() and use the\\nreturned BWindow reference to move the frontmost window off the other two. The\\nresult appears in Figure 4-1.\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nMyHelloWindow *frontWindow;\\naWindow = new\\naWindow = new\\naWindow = new\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nMyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\n}\\n\\nFigure 4-1. The result of running the FrontWindow program\\n\\nNotice that before working with the returned window reference, I verify that it has\\na non-NULL value. If no windows are open when GetFrontWindow() is invoked,\\nthat routine returns NULL. In such a case, a call to a BWindow member function\\nsuch as MoveBy() will fail.\\nThe MyHelloWindow class doesn\\'t define any of its own member functions--it\\nrelies on BWindow-inherited functions. So in this example, I could have declared\\nfrontWindow to be of type BWindow and omitted the typecasting of the returned\\nBWindow reference. This code would still work:\\n...\\nBWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\n...\\nfrontWindow = GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\n}\\n\\nBut instead of working with the returned reference as a BWindow object, I opted to\\ntypecast it to a MyHelloWindow object. That\\'s a good habit to get into--the type\\nof window being accessed is then evident to anyone looking at the source code\\nlisting. It also sets up the returned object so that it can invoke any BWindowderived class member function. A BWindow object knows about only BWindow\\nfunctions, so if I define a SpinWindow() member function in the MyHelloWindow\\nclass and then attempt to call it without typecasting the GetFrontWindow()returned BWindow reference, the compiler will complain:\\nBWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\nfrontWindow->SpinWindow();\\n\\n// compilation error at this line\\n\\nThe corrected version of the above snippet looks like this:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*frontWindow;\\n\\nfrontWindow = (MyHelloWindow *)GetFrontWindow();\\nif (frontWindow)\\nfrontWindow->SpinWindow();\\n// compiles just fine!\\n\\nWindows and Data Members\\nDefining a GetFrontWindow() or some similar member function to locate a window is one way to access a window. If you have only one instance of any given\\nwindow class in your program, though, you should consider using a technique\\nthat stores window references in data members in the application object.\\nDefining a window object data member in the application class\\nFor each type of window in your application, you can add to the class definition a\\nprivate data member of the window class type. Consider a program that displays\\ntwo windows: an input window for entering a mathematical equation, and an output window that displays a graph of the entered equation. If such a program\\ndefines BWindow-derived classes named EquationWindow and GraphWindow, the\\nBApplication-derived class could include two data members. As shown below,\\nBe convention uses a lowercase f as the first character of a data member name:\\nclass MathApp : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nMathApp();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n...\\nprivate:\\nEquationWindow\\nGraphWindow\\n\\n*fEquationWindow;\\n*fGraphWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nFor the MyHelloWorld project, the MyHelloApplication class is defined as:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nStoring a window object in the data member\\nIn past examples, I created an instance of a window by declaring a local window\\nvariable in the application constructor, then using that variable in a call to the window\\'s class constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow *aWindow;\\n...\\naWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nWith the new technique, there\\'s no need to use a local variable. Instead, assign the\\nobject returned by the window constructor to the window data member. The new\\nversion of the MyHelloApplication class defines an fMyWindow data member,\\nso the result would be:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nHere\\'s how the new version of the MyHelloApplication constructor looks:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nOnce created, the new window can be accessed from any application member\\nfunction. For instance, to jump the window across part of the screen requires only\\none statement:\\n\\x0cWindows\\n\\n\\nWindow object data member example projects\\nThis chapter\\'s MyHelloWorld project consists of the new version of the\\nMyHelloApplication class--the version that includes an fMyWindow data member. The executable built from this project is indistinguishable from that built from\\nprior versions of the project; running the program results in the display of a single\\nwindow that holds the string \"Hello, My World!\"\\nThe WindowTester project picks up where MyHelloWorld leaves off. Like MyHelloWorld, it includes an fMyWindow data member in the MyHelloApplication\\nclass. The WindowTester version of the MyHelloApplication class also includes\\na new application-defined member function:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nDoWindowStuff();\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n\\n};\\n\\nAfter creating a window and assigning it to the fMyWindow data member, the\\nMyHelloApplication constructor invokes DoWindowStuff():\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-vnd.dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nDoWindowStuff();\\n}\\n\\nI\\'ve implemented DoWindowStuff() such that it glides the program\\'s one window diagonally across the screen:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::DoWindowStuff()\\n{\\nfor (i=0; i<200; i++) {\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nFeel free to experiment by commenting out the code in\\nDoWindowStuff() and replacing it with code that has fMyWindow\\ninvoke BWindow member functions other than MoveBy(). Refer to\\nthe BWindow section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for\\nthe details on such BWindow member functions as Close(), Hide(),\\nShow(), Minimize(), ResizeTo(), and SetTitle().\\n\\nViews\\nA window always holds one or more views. While examples up to this point have\\nall displayed windows that include only a single view, real-world Be applications\\nmake use of windows that often consist of a number of views. Because all drawing must take place in a view, everything you see within a window appears in a\\nview. A scrollbar, button, picture, or text lies within a view. The topic of drawing\\nin views is significant enough that it warrants its own chapter--Chapter 5, Drawing. In this chapter, the focus will be on how views are created and accessed.\\nAdditionally, you\\'ll get an introduction to how a view responds to a message.\\nA view is capable of responding to a message sent from the Application Server to\\na BWindow object and then on to the view. This messaging system is the principle\\non which controls such as buttons work. The details of working with controls are\\nsaved for Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, but this chapter ends with a discussion of views and messages that will hold you over until you reach that chapter.\\n\\nAccessing Views\\nYou\\'ve seen that a window can be accessed by storing a reference to the window\\nin the BApplication-derived class (as demonstrated with the fMyWindow data\\nmember) or via the BeOS API (through use of the BApplication member function WindowAt()). A similar situation exists for accessing a view.\\nViews and data members\\nJust as a reference to a window can be stored in an application class data member, a reference to a view can be stored in a window class data member. The\\nMyHelloWorld project defines a single view class named MyHelloView that is\\nused with the project\\'s single window class, the MyHelloWindow class. Here I\\'ll\\nadd a MyHelloView reference data member to the MyHelloWindow class:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nvirtual bool\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nUsing this new technique, a view can be added to a new window in the window\\'s constructor, much as you\\'ve seen in past examples. The MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor creates a new view, and a call to the BWindow member function\\nAddChild() makes the view a child of the window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe window\\'s view can now be easily accessed and manipulated from any\\nMyHelloWindow member function.\\nView data member example projects\\nThis chapter\\'s NewMyHelloWorld project includes the new versions of the\\nMyHelloWindow class and the MyHelloWindow constructor--the versions developed above. Once again, performing a build on the project results in an executable that displays a single \"Hello, My World!\" window. This is as expected. Using a\\ndata member to keep track of the window\\'s one view simply sets up the window\\nfor easy access to the view--it doesn\\'t change how the window or view behaves.\\nThe ViewDataMember project serves as an example of view access via a data\\nmember--the fMyView data member that was just added to the NewMyHelloWorld project. Here\\'s how the ViewDataMember project defines the\\nMyHelloWindow class:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nSetHelloViewFont(BFont newFont, int32 newSize);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nThe difference between this project and the previous version is that this project\\nuses the newly added SetHelloViewFont() member function to set the type and\\nsize of the font used in a view. In particular, the project calls this routine to set the\\ncharacteristics of the font used in the MyHelloView view that the fMyView data\\nmember references. Here\\'s what the SetHelloViewFont() implementation looks\\nlike:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::SetHelloViewFont(BFont newFont, int32 newSize)\\n{\\nfMyView->SetFont(&newFont);\\nfMyView->SetFontSize(newSize);\\n}\\n\\nSetFont() and SetFontSize() are BView member functions with which you are\\nfamiliar--they\\'re both invoked from the MyHelloView AttachedToWindow()\\nfunction, and were introduced in Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects.\\nTo change a view\\'s font, SetHelloViewFont() is invoked by a MyHelloWindow\\nobject. To demonstrate its use, I chose to include the call in the MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBFont theFont = be_plain_font;\\nSetHelloViewFont(theFont, theSize);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe call to SetHelloViewFont() results in the about-to-be shown window having text characteristics that include a font type of plain and a font size of 12.\\nFigure 4-2 shows the results of creating a new window. While\\nSetHelloViewFont() is a trivial routine, it does the job of demonstrating view\\naccess and the fact that characteristics of a view can be changed at any time during a program\\'s execution.\\n\\nFigure 4-2. The ViewDataMember window displays text in a 12-point plain font\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nA More Practical Use For SetHelloViewFont()\\nAttaching a view to a window by calling AddChild() automatically invokes\\nthe view\\'s AttachedToWindow() routine to take care of any final view setup.\\nRecall that the MyHelloView class overrides this BView member function and\\ninvokes SetFont() and SetFontSize() in the AttachedToWindow() implementation:\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nSo it turns out that in the above version of the MyHelloWindow constructor,\\nthe view\\'s font information is set twice, almost in succession. The result is that\\nwhen the view is displayed, the last calls to SetFont() and SetFontSize()\\nare used when drawing in the view, as shown in Figure 4-2.\\nBecause this example project has very few member functions (intentionally, to\\nkeep it easily readable), I\\'m limited in where I can place a call to\\nSetHelloViewFont(). In a larger project, a call to SetHelloViewFont()\\nmight be invoked from the code that responds to, say, a button click or a menu\\nitem selection. After reading Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, Menus, you\\'ll be able to\\neasily try out one of these more practical uses for a routine such as\\nSetHelloViewFont().\\n\\nAccessing a view using FindView()\\nWhen a view is created, one of the arguments passed to the view constructor is a\\nstring that represents the view\\'s name:\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nThe MyHelloView class constructor invokes the BView constructor to take care of\\nthe creation of the view. When it does that, it in turn passes on the string as the\\nsecond argument, as done here:\\nMyHelloView::MyHelloView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nIf your code provides each view with a unique name, access to any particular\\nview can be easily gained by using the BWindow member function FindView().\\nFor instance, in this next snippet a pointer to the previously created view with the\\nname \"MyHelloView\" is being obtained. Assume that the following code is called\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nfrom within a MyHelloApplication member function, and that a window has\\nalready been created and a reference to it stored in the MyHelloApplication\\ndata member fMainWindow:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*theView;\\n\\ntheView = (MyHelloView *)fMainWindow->FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nFindView() returns a BView object. The above snippet typecasts this BView\\nobject to one that matches the exact type of view being referenced--a\\nMyHelloView view.\\nFindView() example project\\nThe FindByName project does just that--it finds a view using a view name. This\\nproject is another version of this chapter\\'s MyHelloWorld. Here I keep track of the\\nprogram\\'s one window using a data member in the MyHelloApplication class. A\\nreference to the program\\'s one view isn\\'t, however, stored in a data member in the\\nMyHelloWindow class. Instead, the view is accessed from the window using a call\\nto FindView(). Here\\'s the MyHelloWindow constructor that creates a view named\\n\"MyHelloView\" and adds it to a new window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\naView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow member function QuitRequested() has remained\\nunchanged since its introduction in Chapter 1. All it did was post a B_QUIT_\\nREQUESTED and return true. I\\'ll change that by adding a chunk of code.\\nFigure 4-3 shows how the program\\'s window looks just before closing.\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nbigtime_t\\nmicroseconds = 1000000;\\naView = (MyHelloView *)FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\nif (aView) {\\naView->DrawString(\"Quitting...\");\\naView->Invalidate();\\n}\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n\\n}\\n\\nFigure 4-3. The FindByName program adds text to a window before closing it\\n\\nThe new version of QuitRequested() now does the following:\\n\\n\\nAccesses the view named \"MyHelloView.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCalls a few BView member functions to draw a string and update the view.\\n\\n\\n\\nPauses for one second.\\n\\n\\n\\nCloses the window and quits.\\n\\nSeveral lines of code are worthy of further discussion.\\nThe \"Accessing a view using FindView()\" section in this chapter demonstrates the\\nuse of FindView() from an existing window object:\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*theView;\\n\\ntheView = (MyHelloView *)fMainWindow->FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nThis latest example demonstrates the use of FindView() from within a window\\nmember function. The specific object FindView() acts on is the one invoking\\nQuitRequested(), so unlike the above example, here no MyHelloWindow object\\nvariable precedes the call to FindView():\\nMyHelloView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = (MyHelloView *)FindView(\"MyHelloView\");\\n\\nWith a reference to the MyHelloView object, QuitRequested() can invoke any\\nBView member function. MovePenTo() and DrawString() are functions you\\'ve\\nseen before--they also appear in the MyHelloView member function Draw().\\nInvalidate() is new to you. When a view\\'s contents are altered--as they are\\nhere with the writing of the string \"Quitting...\"--the view needs to be updated\\nbefore the changes become visible onscreen. If the changes are made while the\\nview\\'s window is hidden, then the subsequent act of showing that window brings\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\non the update. Here, with the window showing and frontmost, no update automatically occurs after the call to DrawString(). The BView member function\\nInvalidate() tells the system that the current contents of the view are no longer\\nvalid and require updating. When the system receives this update message, it\\nimmediately obliges the view by redrawing it.\\nFinally, the snooze() function is new to you. The BeOS API includes a number of\\nglobal, or nonmember, functions--snooze() is one of them. A global function\\nisn\\'t associated with any class or object, so once the BApplication-defined object\\nis created in main(), it can be called from any point in a program. The snooze()\\nfunction requires one argument, the number of microseconds for which execution\\nshould pause. The parameter is of type bigtime_t, which is a typedef equivalent to the int64 datatype. Here, the first call to snooze() pauses execution for\\none million microseconds, or one second, while the second call pauses execution\\nfor fifty thousand microseconds, or one-twentieth of one second:\\nbigtime_t\\n\\nmicroseconds = 1000000;\\n\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n\\nIn this book I\\'ll make occasional use of a few global functions. In\\nparticular, you\\'ll see calls to snooze() and beep() in several examples. You\\'ll quickly recognize a function as being global because it\\nstarts with a lowercase character. A global function is associated with\\none of the Be kits, so you\\'ll find it documented in the Global Functions section of the appropriate kit chapter in the Be Book. For\\ninstance, snooze() puts a thread to sleep, so it\\'s documented in\\nthe thread-related chapter of the Be Book, the Kernel Kit chapter.\\nThe beep() global function plays the system beep. Sound (and thus\\nthe beep() function) is a topic covered in the Media Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book.\\n\\nView Hierarchy\\nA window can hold any number of views. When a window holds more than one,\\nthe views fall into a hierarchy.\\nTop view\\nEvery window contains at least one view, even if none is explicitly created and\\nadded with calls to AddChild(). That\\'s because upon creation, a window is\\nalways automatically given a top view--a view that occupies the entire content\\narea of the window. Even if the window is resized, the top view occupies the\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nentire window content. A top view exists only to serve as an organizer, or container, of other views. The other views are added by the application. Such an\\napplication-added view maps out a window area that has its own drawing characteristics (such as font type and line width), is capable of being drawn to, and is\\nable to respond to messages.\\nApplication-added views and the view hierarchy\\nEach view you add to the window falls into a window view hierarchy. Any view\\nthat is added directly to the window (via a call to the BWindow member function\\nAddChild()) falls into the hierarchy just below the top view. Adding a few views\\nto a window in this way could result in a window and view hierarchy like those\\nshown in Figure 4-4.\\n\\nTop\\nView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-4. A window with three views added to it and that window\\'s view hierarchy\\n\\nWhen a view is added to a window, there is no visible sign that the\\nview exists. So in Figure 4-4, the window\\'s views--including the top\\nview--are outlined and are named. The added views have also been\\ngiven a light gray background. While the view framing, shading, and\\ntext have been added for clarity, you could in fact easily create a\\nwindow that highlighted its views in this way. You already know\\nhow to add text to a view using DrawString(). Later in this chapter you\\'ll see how to draw a rectangle in a view. And in Chapter 5\\nyou\\'ll see how to change the background color of a view.\\n\\nThe views you add to a window don\\'t have to exist on the same hierarchical level;\\nthey can be nested one inside another. Figure 4-5 shows another window with\\nthree views added to the top view. Here, one view has been placed inside\\nanother.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nTop\\nView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-5. A window with nested views added to it and that window\\'s view hierarchy\\n\\nTo place a view within another, you add the view to the container view rather\\nthan to the window. Just as the BWindow class has an AddChild() member function, so does the BView class. This next snippet shows a window constructor that\\ncreates two views. The first is 200 pixels by 300 pixels in size, and is added to the\\nwindow. The second 150 pixels by 150 pixels, and is added to the first view.\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"Nested Views\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nBRect\\nviewFrame;\\nview1 = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MyFirstView\");\\nview2 = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MySecondView\");\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nMultiple views example project\\nLater in this chapter you\\'ll see a few example projects that place two views of type\\nMyHelloView in a window. Having the views be the same type isn\\'t required, of\\ncourse--they can be different class types. The TwoViewClasses project defines a\\nview named MyDrawView and adds one such view to a window, along with an\\ninstance of the MyHelloView class with which you\\'re already familiar. Figure 4-6\\nshows the window that results from running the TwoViewClasses program.\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-6. A window that holds two different types of views\\n\\nIn keeping with the informal convention of placing the code for a class declaration in its own header file and the code for the implementation of the member\\nfunctions of that class in its own source code file, the TwoViewClasses project\\nnow has a new source code file added to it. Figure 4-7 shows the project window\\nfor this project.\\n\\nFigure 4-7. The TwoViewClasses project window shows the addition of a new source code file\\n\\nI haven\\'t shown a project window since Chapter 2, and won\\'t show\\none again. I did it here to lend emphasis to the way in which\\nprojects are set up throughout this book (and by many other Be programmers as well).\\n\\nI created the new class by first copying the MyHelloView.h and MyHelloView.cpp\\nfiles and renaming them to MyDrawView.h and MyDrawView.cpp, respectively. My\\nintent here is to demonstrate that a project can derive any number of classes from\\nthe BView class and readily mix them in any one window. So I\\'ll only make a couple of trivial changes to the copied MyHelloView class to make it evident that this\\nis a new class. In your own project, the BView-derived classes you define may be\\nvery different from one another.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nWith the exception of the class name and the name of the constructor, the\\nMyDrawView class declaration is identical to the MyHelloView class declaration.\\nFrom the MyDrawView.h file, here\\'s that declaration:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n};\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\nLike the MyHelloView constructor, the MyDrawView constructor is empty:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyDrawView member function AttachedToWindow() sets up the view\\'s font\\nand font size. Whereas the MyHelloView specified a 12-point font, the\\nMyDrawView specifies a 24-point font:\\nvoid MyHelloView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nExcept for the text drawn to the view, the MyDrawView member function Draw()\\nlooks like the MyHelloView version of this function:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\nDrawString(\"This is a MyDrawView view\");\\n}\\n\\nTo create a further contrast in the way the two views display text, I turned to the\\nMyHelloView and made one minor modification. In the AttachedToWindow()\\nmember function of that class, I changed the font set by SetFont() from be_\\nbold_font to be_plain_font. Refer to Figure 4-6 to see the difference in text\\nappearances in the two views.\\nIn order for a window to be able to reference both of the views it will hold, a new\\ndata member has been added to the MyHelloWindow class. In the MyHelloWindow.h header file, you\\'ll find the addition of a MyDrawView data member named\\nfMyDrawView:\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloView\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fMyDrawView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIn the past the MyHelloWindow constructor created and added a single view to\\nitself. Now the constructor adds a second view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfMyDrawView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyDrawView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nBoth views have been added directly to the window (to the top view), rather than\\nto another view, so both views are on the same level in the window\\'s view hierarchy. The Draw() function of each view type includes code to frame the view, so\\nyou can easily see the results of any view size changes you might make to the\\nviews here in the MyHelloWindow constructor.\\n\\nCoordinate System\\nIn order to specify where a window is to be placed on the screen and where a\\nview is to be placed within a window, a coordinate system is required.\\nGlobal coordinate system\\nTo allow a programmer to reference any point on the computer screen, Be defines\\na coordinate system that gives every pixel a pair of values: one for the pixel\\'s distance from the left edge of the screen and one for the pixel\\'s distance from the top\\nof the screen. Figure 4-8 points out a few pixels and their corresponding coordinate pairs.\\nFor display devices, the concept of fractional pixels doesn\\'t apply. Consider a window that is to have its top left corner appear 100 pixels from the left edge of the\\nscreen and 50 pixels from the top of the screen. This point is specified as (100.0,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nx-axis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny-axis\\nFigure 4-8. The global coordinate system maps the screen to a two-dimensional graph\\n\\n50.0). If the point (100.1, 49.9) is used instead, the result is the same--the window\\'s corner ends up 100 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the top of the\\nscreen.\\nThe above scenario begs the question: if the coordinates of pixel locations are simply rounded to integral values, why use floating points at all? The answer lies in\\nthe current state of output devices: most printers have high resolutions. On such a\\ndevice, one coordinate unit doesn\\'t map to one printed dot. A coordinate unit is\\nalways 1/72 of an inch. If a printer has a resolution of 72 dots per inch by 72 dots\\nper inch (72 dpi  72 dpi), then one coordinate unit would in fact translate to one\\nprinted dot. Typically printers have much higher resolutions, such as 300 dpi or\\n600 dpi. If a program specifies that a horizontal line be given a height of 1.3 units,\\nthen that line will occupy one row of pixels on the screen (the fractional part of\\nthe line height is rounded off). When that same line is sent to a printer with a resolution of 600 dpi, however, that printer will print the line with a height of 11\\nrows. This value comes from the fact that one coordinate unit translates to 8.33\\ndots (that\\'s 1/72 of 600). Here there is no rounding of the fractional coordinate\\nunit, so 1.3 coordinate units is left at 1.3 units (rather than 1 unit) and translates to\\n11 dots (1.3 times 8.33 is 10.83). Whether the line is viewed on the monitor or on\\nhardcopy, it will have roughly the same look--it will be about 1/72 inch high. It\\'s\\njust that the rows of dots on a printer are denser than the rows of pixels on the\\nmonitor.\\nWindow coordinate system\\nWhen a program places a view in a window, it does so relative to the window,\\nnot to the screen. That is, regardless of where a window is positioned on the\\nscreen when the view is added, the view ends up in the same location within the\\ncontent area of the window. This is possible because a window has its own\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\n\\ncoordinate system--one that\\'s independent of the global screen coordinate system. The type of system is the same as the global system (floating point values that\\nget larger as you move right and down)--but the origin is different. The origin of\\na window\\'s coordinate system is the top left corner of the window\\'s content area.\\nWhen a program adds a view to a window, the view\\'s boundary rectangle values\\nare stated in terms of the window\\'s coordinate system. Consider the following window constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nMyHelloView *aView;\\nBRect\\naView = new MyHelloView(viewFrame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(aView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe coordinate systems for the window and the view are different. The window\\'s\\nsize and screen placement, which are established by the BRect variable frame\\nthat is passed to the constructor, are expressed in the global coordinate system.\\nThe view\\'s size and placement, established by the local BRect variable\\nviewFrame, are expressed in the window coordinate system. Regardless of where\\nthe window is placed, the view aView will have its top left corner at point (20.0,\\n30.0) within the window.\\n\\nIn all previous examples, the arguments to a BRect constructor, or\\nto the BRect member function Set(), were integer values, such as\\n(20, 30, 120, 130). Since none of the examples were concerned with\\nhigh precision printouts, that technique worked fine. It also may\\nhave been comforting to you if you come from a Mac or Windows\\nprogramming background, where rectangle boundaries use integral\\nvalues. Now that we\\'ve seen the true nature of the BeOS coordinate\\nsystem, however, we\\'ll start--and continue--to use floating point\\nvalues.\\n\\nView coordinate system\\nWhen a program draws in a view, it draws relative to the view, not to the window or the screen. It doesn\\'t matter where a window is onscreen, or where a view\\nis within a window--the drawing will take place using the view\\'s own coordinate\\nsystem. Like the global and window coordinate systems, the view coordinate system is one of floating point coordinate pairs that increase in value from left to right\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nand from top to bottom. The origin is located at the top left corner of the view.\\nConsider this version of the MyHelloView member function Draw():\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n}\\n\\nThe arguments in the call to the BView member function MovePenTo() are local\\nto the view\\'s coordinate system. Regardless of where the view is located within its\\nwindow, text drawing will start 10 units in from the left edge of the view and 30\\nunits down from the top edge of the view.\\nFigure 4-9 highlights the fact that there are three separate coordinate systems at\\nwork in a program that displays a window that holds a view.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4-9. The screen, windows, and views have their own coordinate systems\\n\\nCoordinate system example projects\\nTo determine the size of a view in its own coordinate system (whether the view\\nresides in a window or within another view), begin by invoking the BView member function Bounds(). In this chapter\\'s OneView project, a call to this function\\nhas been added to the MyHelloView member function Draw(). One other BView\\nmember function call has been added too--a call to StrokeRect(). This routine\\ndraws a rectangle at the coordinates specified by the BRect argument passed to it:\\nvoid MyHelloView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n\\x0cViews\\n\\nDrawString(\"Hello, My World!\");\\n\\n}\\n\\nSince the rectangle returned by the Bounds() function call is relative to the view\\'s\\nown coordinate system, the left and top fields are always 0.0. The right and\\nbottom fields reveal the view\\'s width and height, respectively.\\nTo find a view\\'s boundaries relative to the window or view it resides in, call the\\nBView member function Frame(). The rectangle returned by a call to Frame()\\nhas left and top fields that indicate the view\\'s distance in and down from the\\nwindow or view it resides in.\\nThe OneView project creates a single MyHelloView view and adds it to a window. These steps take place in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nNow that you know about the different coordinate systems, setting up the view\\nrectangle might make more sense to you. In the above snippet, the BRect parameter frame holds the coordinates of the window. These coordinates directly define\\nthe screen placement of the window and indirectly define the size of the window\\n(subtract frame.left from frame.right to get the window\\'s width, and subtract frame.top from frame.bottom to get the window\\'s height). Calling the\\nBRect member function OffsetTo() with B_ORIGIN as the parameter shifts these\\ncoordinates so that each of the frame.left and frame.top fields has a value of\\n0.0. The overall size of the frame rectangle itself, however, doesn\\'t change--it is\\nstill the size of the window. It just no longer reflects the screen positioning of the\\nwindow. Next, the view that is to be added to the window is created. The view is\\nto be positioned in the window using the window\\'s coordinate system, so if the\\nview is to fit snugly in the window, the view must have its top left corner at the\\nwindow\\'s origin. The frame rectangle that was initially used to define the placement and size of the window can now be used to define the placement and size\\nof the view that is to fill the window.\\nWhen the BWindow member function Show() is invoked from the window constructor, the window is drawn to the screen and the view\\'s Draw() function is\\nautomatically called to update the view. When that happens, the view is outlined--the Draw() function draws a line around the perimeter of the view.\\nFigure 4-10 shows the result of creating a new window in the OneView project.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nBecause the window\\'s one view is exactly the size of the content area of the window, the entire content area gets a line drawn around it.\\n\\nFigure 4-10. Drawing a rectangle around the OneView window\\'s view\\n\\nThe OneSmallView project is very similar to the OneView project--both draw a\\nframe around the one view that resides in the program\\'s window. To demonstrate\\nthat a view doesn\\'t have to occupy the entire content area of a window, the OneSmallView project sets up the view\\'s boundary rectangle to be smaller than the\\nwindow. This is done in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyHelloView(frame, \"MyHelloView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHere the line that offsets the window boundary rectangle (the BRect parameter\\nframe) has been replaced by one that calls the BRect member function Set() to\\nreset all the values of the frame rectangle. Figure 4-11 shows the resulting window. Note that a view is aware of its own boundaries, so that when you try to\\ndraw (or write) beyond a view edge, the result is truncated.\\n\\nFigure 4-11. When a view is too small for the window content\\n\\nMessaging\\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the Application Server communicates with (serves) an\\napplication by making the program aware of user actions. This communication is\\ndone in the form of system messages sent from the server to the application. Mes-\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nsages are received by a window and, often, passed on to a view in that window.\\nThe BeOS shoulders most of the responsibility of this communication between the\\nApplication Server, windows, and views. Your application (typically a view in a\\nwindow in your application) is responsible for performing some specific action in\\nresponse to a message.\\n\\nSystem Messages\\nA system message is sent from the Application Server to a BLooper object. Both\\nthe BApplication and BWindow classes are derived from BLooper, so objects of\\nthese two classes (or objects of classes derived from these two classes) can receive\\nmessages. The Application server is responsible for directing a system message to\\nthe appropriate type of object.\\nThe message loop of a program\\'s BWindow-derived object receives messages that\\nhold information about user actions. If the user typed a character, that character\\nmay need to be entered into a window. If the user clicked a mouse button, that\\nclick may have been made while the cursor was over a button in the window. The\\nsystem message types of these two user actions are B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN. Such BWindow-directed system messages are referred to as interface messages.\\nThe message loop of a program\\'s BApplication-derived object receives messages that pertain to the application itself (as opposed to messages that pertain to\\na window or view, which are sent to a BWindow-derived object). If the user\\nchooses the About menu item present in most programs, the program dispatches\\nto the application object a message of type B_ABOUT_REQUESTED. Such\\nBApplication-directed system messages are referred to as application messages.\\n\\nSee the Application Kit chapter of the Be Book for a description of\\nall of the application messages, and the Interface Kit chapter for a\\ndescription of all the interface messages.\\n\\nSystem message dispatching\\nWhen a system message reaches a looper object (such as the application object or\\na window object), that object handles, or dispatches, the message by automatically invoking a virtual hook function. Such a function is declared virtual so that\\nyour own derived classes can override it in order to reimplement it to match your\\nprogram\\'s specific needs. In that sense, you\\'re \"hooking\" your own code onto the\\nsystem code.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nEach system message has a corresponding hook function. For the three system\\nmessages mentioned above (B_ABOUT_REQUESTED, B_KEY_DOWN, and B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN), those functions are AboutRequested(), KeyDown(), and MouseDown().\\nThe application object itself handles a B_ABOUT_REQUESTED message by calling\\nthe BApplication member function AboutRequested(). A window object, on\\nthe other hand, passes a B_KEY_DOWN or B_MOUSE_DOWN message on to the particular view object to which the message pertains. This view object then invokes the\\nBView member function KeyDown() or MouseDown() to handle the message.\\nTypes of hook functions\\nFor some system messages, the hook function defined by the Be class takes care\\nof all the work suggested by the message. For instance, a click on a window\\'s\\nzoom button results in a B_ZOOM message being sent to the affected window. The\\nreceiving of this message automatically brings about the execution of the BWindow\\nmember function Zoom(). This hook function is fully implemented, meaning that\\nyou need to add no code to your project in order to support a click in a window\\'s zoom button.\\nAll hook functions are declared virtual, so your code can override even fully\\nimplemented ones. Unless your application needs to perform some nonstandard\\naction in response to the message, though, there\\'s no need to do so.\\nFor other system messages, the hook function is implemented in such a way that\\nthe most common response to the message is handled. A program may override\\nthis type of hook function and reimplement it in such a way that the new version\\nhandles application-specific needs. This new application-defined version of the\\nhook function may also call the original Be-defined BView version of the routine\\nin order to incorporate the default actions of that BView version. An example of\\nthis type of hook function is ScreenChanged(), which is invoked in response to\\na B_SCREEN_CHANGED message. When the user changes the screen (perhaps by\\naltering the monitor resolution), the application may need to make special adjustments to an open window. After doing that, the application-defined version of\\nScreenChanged() should invoke the BView-defined version of this routine so\\nthat the standard screen-changing code that\\'s been supplied by Be can execute\\ntoo.\\nFinally, for some system messages, the hook function implementation is left to the\\napplication. If an application is to respond to user actions that generate messages\\nof types such as B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_DOWN, that application needs to override BView hook functions such as KeyDown() and MouseDown().\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nInterface messages\\nA system message directed at the application object is an application message,\\nwhile a system message directed at a window object is an interface message.\\nResponding to user actions is of great importance to a user-friendly application, so\\nthe remainder of this chapter is dedicated to illustrating how a project goes about\\ndoing this. In particular, I\\'ll discuss the handling of two of the interface messages\\n(B_KEY_DOWN and B_MOUSE_DOWN). Summarized below are several of the interface messages; refer to the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book for a description\\nof each of the 18 message types.\\nB_KEY_DOWN\\nGoes to the active window in response to the user pressing a character key.\\nThe recipient window invokes the BView hook function KeyDown() of the\\naffected view. The affected view is typically one that accepts text entry, such\\nas a view of the yet-to-be-discussed BTextControl or BTextView classes. An\\nexample of handling a B_KEY_DOWN message is presented later in this chapter.\\nB_KEY_UP\\nIs sent to the active window when the user releases a pressed character key.\\nThe recipient window invokes the BView hook function KeyUp() of the\\naffected view. Typically, a program responds to a B_KEY_DOWN message and\\nignores the B_KEY_UP message that follows. In other words, the program\\ndoesn\\'t override the BView hook function KeyUp().\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\nIs sent to the window over which the cursor was located at the time of the\\nmouse button click. The window that receives the message calls the BView\\nhook function MouseDown() of the view the cursor was over at the time of\\nthe mouse button click.\\nB_MOUSE_UP\\nReaches the window that was affected by a B_MOUSE_DOWN message when the\\nuser releases a pressed mouse button. The MouseDown() hook function that\\nexecutes in response to a B_MOUSE_DOWN message often sufficiently handles a\\nmouse button click, so a B_MOUSE_UP message is often ignored by a program. That is, the program doesn\\'t override the BView hook function\\nMouseUp().\\nB_MOUSE_MOVED\\nIs sent to a window when the user moves the cursor over the window. As the\\nuser drags the mouse, repeated B_MOUSE_MOVED messages are issued by the\\nApplication Server. As the cursor moves over one window to another, the window to which the messages are sent changes. When the mouse is moved over\\nthe desktop rather than a window, a B_MOUSE_MOVED message is sent to the\\nDesktop window of the Tracker.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nMouse Clicks and Views\\nWhen a window receives a B_MOUSE_DOWN message from the Application Server,\\nthe window object (without help from you) determines which of its views should\\nrespond. It is that view\\'s MouseDown() hook function that is then invoked.\\nThe ViewsMouseMessages project includes a MouseDown() routine with the\\nMyHelloView class in order to make the program \"mouse-click aware.\" The\\nViewsMouseMessages program displays a single window that holds two framed\\nMyHelloView views. Clicking the mouse while the cursor is over either view\\nresults in the playing of the system beep.\\nThe mechanism for responding to a mouse click has already been present in every\\nexample project in this book, so there\\'s very little new code in the ViewsMouseMessages project. The ViewsMouseMessages program, and every other program\\nyou\\'ve seen in this book, works as follows: when the user clicks the mouse button while the cursor is over a window, the Application Server sends a B_MOUSE_\\nDOWN message to the affected window, causing it to invoke the affected view\\'s\\nMouseDown() hook function. The MyHelloView class is derived from the BView\\nclass, and the BView class defines its version of MouseDown() as an empty function. So unless the MyHelloView class overrides MouseDown(), it inherits this \"donothing\" routine. In all previous examples, a mouse button click while the cursor\\nwas over a view resulted in the execution of this empty routine--so effectively the\\nmouse button click was ignored. The ViewsMouseMessages project overrides\\nMouseDown() so that a mouse button click with the cursor over a view now\\nresults in something happening. Here\\'s the latest version of the MyHelloView\\nclass definition, with the addition of the MouseDown() declaration:\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe one MouseDown() parameter is a BPoint that is passed to the routine by the\\nApplication Server. This point parameter holds the location of the cursor at the\\ntime the mouse button was clicked. The values of the point are in the view\\'s coordinate system. For example, if the cursor was over the very top left corner of the\\nview at the time of the mouse click, the point\\'s coordinates would be close to (0.0,\\n0.0). In other words, both point.x and point.y would have a value close to 0.0.\\nTo verify that the B_MOUSE_DOWN message has worked its way to the new version\\nof MouseDown(), the implementation of MouseDown() sounds the system beep:\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n}\\n\\nRecall that beep() is a global function that, like the snooze() routine covered\\nearlier in this chapter, can be called from any point in your project\\'s source code.\\n\\nKey Presses and Views\\nIn response to a B_MOUSE_DOWN message, a window object invokes the\\nMouseDown() function of the affected view. For the window object, determining\\nwhich view is involved is simple--it chooses whichever view object is under the\\ncursor at the time of the mouse button click. This same test isn\\'t made by the window in response to a B_KEY_DOWN message. That\\'s because the location of the\\ncursor when a key is pressed is generally insignificant. The scheme used to determine which view\\'s KeyDown() hook function to invoke involves a focus view.\\nFocus view\\nA program can make any view the focus view by invoking that view\\'s\\nMakeFocus() function. For a view that accepts typed input (such as BTextControl or a BTextView view), the call is made implicitly when the user clicks in\\nthe view to activate the insertion bar. Any view, however, can be made the focus\\nview by explicitly calling MakeFocus(). Here a click of the mouse button while\\nthe cursor is over a view of type MyHelloView makes that view the focus view:\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nMakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nNow, when a key is pressed, the KeyDown() hook function of the last clicked-on\\nview of type MyHelloView will automatically execute.\\n\\nBecause a MyHelloView view doesn\\'t accept keyboard input, there\\nis no obvious reason to make a view of this type the focus view. We\\nhaven\\'t worked with many view types, so the above example must\\nsuffice here. If you\\'re more comfortable having a reason for making\\na MyHelloView accept keyboard input, consider this rather contrived scenario. You want the user to click on a view of type\\nMyHelloView to make it active. Then you want the user to type any\\ncharacter and have the view echo that character back--perhaps in a\\nlarge, bold font. Including the above MouseDown() routine in a\\nproject suffices to make the view the focus view when clicked on.\\nNow a MyHelloView KeyDown() routine can be written to examine\\nthe typed character, clear the view, and draw the typed character.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 4: Windows, Views, and Messages\\n\\nKeyDown() example project\\nThe ViewsKeyMessages project adds to the ViewsMouseMessages project to create\\na program that responds to both mouse button clicks and key presses. Once again,\\na mouse button click while the cursor is over a view results in the sounding of the\\nsystem beep. Additionally, ViewsKeyMessages beeps twice if the Return key is\\npressed and three times if the 0 (zero) key is pressed.\\nTo allow a MyHelloView view to respond to a press of a key, the BView hook\\nfunction KeyDown() needs to be overridden:\\nclass MyHelloView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nMyHelloView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\nKeyDown(const char *bytes, int32 numBytes);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe first KeyDown() parameter is an array that encodes the typed character along\\nwith any modifier keys (such as the Shift key) that were down at the time of the\\nkey press. The second parameter tells how many bytes are in the array that is the\\nfirst parameter. As with all hook functions, the values of these parameters are filled\\nin by the system and are available in your implementation of the hook function\\nshould they be of use.\\nThe KeyDown() routine responds to two key presses: the Return key and the 0\\n(zero) key. Pressing the Return key plays the system beep sound twice, while\\npressing the 0 key plays the sound three times:\\nvoid MyHelloView::KeyDown(const char *bytes, int32 numBytes)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000;\\nswitch ( *bytes ) {\\ncase B_RETURN:\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMessaging\\n\\ndefault:\\nbreak;\\n\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThere are a number of Be-defined constants you can test bytes against; B_RETURN\\nis one of them. The others are: B_BACKSPACE, B_LEFT_ARROW, B_INSERT, B_\\nENTER, B_RIGHT_ARROW, B_DELETE, B_UP_ARROW, B_HOME, B_SPACE, B_DOWN_\\nARROW, B_END, B_TAB, B_PAGE_UP, B_ESCAPE, B_FUNCTION_KEY, and B_PAGE_\\nDOWN. For a key representing an alphanumeric character, just place the character\\nbetween single quotes, as shown above for the 0 (zero) character.\\nNotice that calls to the global function snooze() appear between calls to the global function beep(). The beep() routine executes in its own thread, which means\\nas soon as the function starts, control returns to the caller. If successive, uninterrupted calls are made to beep(), the multiple playing of the system beep will\\nseem like a single sound.\\nOnly the focus view responds to a key press, so the ViewsKeyMessages program\\nneeds to make one of its two views the focus view. I\\'ve elected to do this in the\\nMyHelloView MouseDown() routine. When the user clicks on a view, that view\\nbecomes the focus view:\\nvoid MyHelloView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nMakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nWhen the user then presses a key, the resulting B_KEY_DOWN message is directed\\nat that view. Since the views are derived from the BView class, rather than a class\\nthat accepts keyboard input, a typed character won\\'t appear in the view. But the\\nview\\'s KeyDown() routine will still be called.\\n\\x0c\\nDrawing\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Colors\\n Patterns\\n The Drawing Pen\\n Shapes\\n\\n5.\\n\\nWhen a Be application draws, it always draws in a view. That\\'s why the chapter\\nthat deals with views precedes this chapter. In Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and\\nMessages, you saw that a BView-derived class overrides its inherited hook member function Draw() so that it can define exactly what view objects should draw\\nin when they get updated. The example projects in this chapter contain classes\\nand member functions that remain unchanged, or changed very little, from previous example projects. What will be different is the content of the Draw() function.\\nThe code that demonstrates the concepts of each drawing topic can usually be\\nadded to the Draw() routine.\\nIn Be programming, the colors and patterns that fill a shape aren\\'t defined explicitly for that shape. Instead, traits of the graphics environment of the view that\\nreceives the drawing are first altered. In other words, many drawing characteristics, such as color and font, are defined at the view level, so all subsequent drawing can use the view settings. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to define a color,\\nthen set a view to draw in that color. You\\'ll see how the same is done for patterns--whether using Be-defined patterns or your own application-defined ones.\\nAfter you learn how to manipulate the graphic characteristics of a view, it\\'s on to\\nthe drawing of specific shapes. The point (represented by BPoint objects) is used\\non its own, to define the end points of a line, and to define the vertices of more\\nsophisticated shapes (such as triangles or polygons). The rectangle (represented by\\nBRect objects) is used on its own and as the basis of more sophisticated shapes.\\nThese shapes include round rectangles, ellipses, and regions. Round rectangles\\nand ellipses are closely related to BRect objects, and aren\\'t defined by their own\\nclasses. Polygons and regions are more sophisticated shapes that make use of\\npoints and rectangles, but are represented by their own class types (BPolygon and\\nBRegion). In this chapter, you\\'ll see how to outline and fill each of these different\\n\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nshapes. Finally, I show how to combine any type and number of these various\\nshapes into a picture represented by a BPicture object.\\n\\nColors\\nThe BeOS is capable of defining colors using any of a number of color spaces. A\\ncolor space is a scheme, or system, for representing colors as numbers. There are\\nseveral color space Be-defined constants, each containing a number that reflects\\nthe number of bits used to represent a single color in a single pixel. For instance,\\nthe B_COLOR_8_BIT color space devotes 8 bits to defining the color of a single\\npixel. The more memory devoted to defining the color of a single pixel, the more\\npossible colors a pixel can display.\\nEach pixel in a drawing is either black (bit is on, or 1) or white (bit is off, or\\n0).\\nEach pixel in a drawing can be one of 256 shades of gray--from black (bit is\\nset to a value of 255) to white (bit is set to a value of 0).\\nEach pixel in a drawing can be one of 256 colors. A pixel value in the range\\nof 0 to 255 is used as an index into a color map. This system color map is\\nidentical for all applications. That means that when two programs use the\\nsame value to color a pixel, the same color will be displayed.\\nEach pixel in a drawing is created from three separate color components: red,\\ngreen, and blue. Five out of a total of sixteen bits are devoted to defining each\\ncolor component. The sixteenth bit is ignored.\\nLike the B_RGB15 color space, each pixel in a drawing is created from three\\nseparate color components: red, green, and blue. In B_RGB32 space, however, eight bits are devoted to defining each color component. The remaining\\neight bits are ignored.\\nLike the B_RGB32 color space, each pixel in a drawing is created from three\\nseparate color components: red, green, and blue. Like B_RGB, eight bits are\\nused to define each of the three color components. In B_RGBA32 space, however, the remaining eight bits aren\\'t ignored--they\\'re devoted to defining an\\nalpha byte, which is used to specify a transparency level for a color.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nRGB Color System\\nAs listed above, the BeOS supports a number of color spaces. The RGB color\\nspace is popular because it provides over sixteen million unique colors (the number of combinations using values in the range of 0 to 255 for each of the three\\ncolor components), and because it is a color system with which many programmers and end users are familiar with (it\\'s common to several operating systems).\\nThe BeOS defines rgb_color as a struct with four fields:\\ntypedef struct {\\n} rgb_color\\n\\nA variable of type rgb_color can be initialized at the time of declaration. The\\norder of the supplied values corresponds to the ordering of the struct definition. The following declares an rgb_color variable named redColor and assigns\\nthe red and alpha fields a value of 255 and the other two fields a value of 0:\\nrgb_color\\n\\n\\nTo add a hint of blue to the color defined by redColor, the third value could be\\nchanged from 0 to, say, 50. Because the alpha component of a color isn\\'t supported at the time of this writing, the last value should be 255. Once supported, an\\nalpha value of 255 will represent a color that is completely opaque; an object of\\nthat color will completely cover anything underneath it. An alpha field value of 0\\nwill result in a color that is completely transparent--an effect you probably don\\'t\\nwant. An rgb_color variable can be set to represent a new color at any time by\\nspecifying new values for some or all of the three color components. Here an\\nrgb_color variable named blueColor is first declared, then assigned values:\\nrgb_color\\n\\nblueColor;\\n\\nblueColor.red\\nblueColor.green\\nblueColor.blue\\nblueColor.alpha\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n\\n\\nWhile choosing values for the red, green, and blue components of a\\ncolor is easy if you want a primary color, the process isn\\'t completely intuitive for other colors. Quickly now, what values should\\nyou use to generate chartreuse? To experiment with colors and their\\nRGB components, run the ColorControl program that\\'s discussed a\\nlittle later in this chapter. By the way, to create the pale, yellowish\\ngreen color that\\'s chartreuse, try values of about 200, 230, and 100\\nfor the red, green, and blue components, respectively.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nHigh and Low Colors\\nLike all graphics objects, an rgb_color variable doesn\\'t display any color in a\\nwindow on its own--it only sets up a color for later use. A view always keeps\\ntrack of two colors, dubbed the high and low colors. When you draw in the view,\\nyou specify whether the current high color, the current low color, or a mix of the\\ntwo colors should be used.\\nViews and default colors\\nWhen a new view comes into existence, it sets a number of drawing characteristics to default values. Included among these are:\\n\\n\\nA high color of black\\n\\n\\n\\nA low color of white\\n\\n\\n\\nA background color of white\\n\\nAdditionally, when a BView drawing function is invoked, by default it uses the\\nview\\'s high color for the drawing. Together, these facts tell you that unless you\\nexplicitly specify otherwise, drawing will be in black on a white background.\\nSetting the high and low colors\\nThe BView member functions SetHighColor() and SetLowColor() alter the\\ncurrent high and low colors of a view. Pass SetHighColor() an rgb_color and\\nthat color becomes the new high color--and remains as such until the next call to\\nSetHighColor(). The SetLowColor() routine works the same way. This next\\nsnippet sets a view\\'s high color to red and its low color to blue:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\n\\nDrawing with the high and low colors\\nPassing an rgb_color structure to SetHighColor() or SetLowColor() establishes that color as the one to be used by a view when drawing. Now let\\'s see\\nhow the high color is used to draw in color:\\nrgb_color\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nThe previous snippet declares redColor to be a variable of type rgb_color and\\ndefines that variable to represent red. The snippet also declares a BRect variable\\nnamed aRect, and sets that variable to represent a rectangle with a width and\\nheight of 100 pixels. The call to SetHighColor() sets the high color to red.\\nFinally, a call to the BView member function FillRect() fills the rectangle aRect\\nwith the current high color (as specified by the Be-defined constant B_SOLID_\\nHIGH)--the color red.\\nShape-drawing routines such as FillRect() are described in detail later in this\\nchapter. For now, a brief introduction will suffice. A shape is typically drawn by\\nfirst creating a shape object to define the shape, then invoking a BView member\\nfunction to draw it. That\\'s what the previous snippet does: it creates a rectangle\\nshape based on a BRect object, then calls the BView member function\\nFillRect() to draw the rectangle.\\nOne of the parameters to a BView shape-drawing routine is a pattern. As you\\'ll see\\nahead in the \"Patterns\" section of this chapter, a pattern is an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel\\ntemplate that defines some combination of the current high color and low color.\\nThis small template can be repeatedly \"stamped\" into an area of any size to fill that\\narea with the pattern. Patterns are everywhere these days: desktop backgrounds,\\nweb page backgrounds, and so on. You can create your own patterns, or use one\\nof the three Be-defined patterns. Each of the Be-defined patterns is represented by\\na constant:\\n\\n\\nB_SOLID_HIGH is a solid fill of the current high color.\\n\\n\\n\\nB_SOLID_LOW is a solid fill of the current low color.\\n\\n\\n\\nB_MIXED_COLORS is a checkerboard pattern of alternating current high color\\nand low color pixels (providing a dithered effect--what looks like a single\\ncolor blended from the two colors).\\n\\nA view\\'s default high color is black. So before a view calls SetHighColor(), the\\nuse of B_SOLID_HIGH results in a solid black pattern being used. The above snippet invokes SetHighColor() to set the current high color to red, so subsequent\\nuses of B_SOLID_HIGH for this one view result in a solid red pattern being used.\\nDetermining the current high and low colors\\nYou can find out the current high or low color for a view at any time by invoking\\nthe BView member functions HighColor() or LowColor(). Each routine returns\\na value of type rgb_color. This snippet demonstrates the calls:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\ncurrentHighColor;\\ncurrentLowColor;\\n\\ncurrentHighColor = HighColor();\\ncurrentLowColor = LowColor();\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nThe default high color is black, so if you invoke HighColor() before using\\nSetHighColor(), an rgb_color with red, green, and blue field values of 0 will\\nbe returned to the program. The default low color is white, so a call to\\nLowColor() before a call to SetLowColor() will result in the return of an rgb_\\ncolor with red, green, and blue field values of 255. Because the alpha field of\\nthe high and low colors is ignored at the time of this writing, the alpha field will\\nbe 255 in both cases.\\nRGB, low, and high color example project\\nThe RGBColor project is used to build a program that displays a window like the\\none shown in Figure 5-1. Given the nature of this topic, you can well imagine that\\nthe window isn\\'t just as it appears in this figure. Instead a shade of each being a\\nshade of gray, the three rectangles in the window are, from left to right, red, blue,\\nand a red-blue checkerboard. Because of the high resolution typical of today\\'s\\nmonitors, the contents of the rightmost rectangle dither to a solid purple rather\\nthan appearing to the eye as alternating red and blue pixels.\\n\\nFigure 5-1. The window that results from running the RGBColor program\\n\\nChapter 4 included the TwoViewClasses project--a project that introduced a new\\nview class named MyDrawView. That class definition was almost identical to the\\noriginal MyHelloView. This chapter\\'s RGBColor project and all remaining projects\\nin this chapter display a single window that holds a single MyDrawView view, and\\nno MyHelloView. So the MyHelloView.cpp file is omitted from these projects, and\\nthe data member meant to keep track of a MyHelloView in the MyHelloWindow\\nclass (reproduced below) is also omitted:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\n\\nbool\\n\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\n\\n*fMyDrawView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nCreating a new MyHelloWindow object now entails creating just a single\\nMyDrawView view that fills the window, then attaching the view to the window:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyDrawView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyDrawView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nDrawing in a view takes place automatically when the system calls the view\\'s\\nDraw() routine. That function is the code I play with in order to try out drawing\\nideas. Here\\'s how the RGBColor project implements the MyDrawView version of\\nDraw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nrgb_color blueColor;\\nblueColor.red = 0;\\nblueColor.green = 0;\\nblueColor.blue = 255;\\nblueColor.alpha = 255;\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n}\\n\\nThe previous routine demonstrates two methods of assigning an rgb_color variable a color value. After that, the SetHighColor() and SetLowColor() functions set the MyDrawView high color and low color to red and blue, respectively.\\nThen in turn each of the three rectangles is set up, then filled.\\n\\nThe View Color (Background)\\nTo color a shape, the program often refers to the B_SOLID_HIGH constant. As you\\njust saw in the previous example project, the B_SOLID_LOW and B_MIXED_COLORS\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nconstants can also be used to include the view\\'s current low color in the drawing.\\nBy now it should be apparent that neither the high nor low color implicitly has\\nanything to do with a view\\'s background color.\\nSetting a view\\'s background color\\nBy default, a new view has a background color of white. This background color\\ncan be set to any RGB color by invoking the BView member function\\nSetViewColor(). Here a view\\'s background color is being set to purple:\\nSetViewColor(purpleColor);\\n\\nCalling SetViewColor() changes the background color of a view without affecting either the high color or the low color. Consider a view with a current high\\ncolor of blue, a current low color of yellow, and a background color set to purple. Calling a BView fill routine with a pattern argument of B_SOLID_HIGH draws\\na blue shape. An argument of B_SOLID_LOW draws a yellow shape. Finally, an\\nargument of B_MIXED_COLORS draws a green shape. All shapes are drawn against\\nthe view\\'s purple background.\\nView color example project\\nThe ViewColor program displays a window that looks identical to that displayed\\nby the RGBColor example, except for one feature. Both programs display a window with a red, blue, and purple rectangle in it, but the ViewColor window background is pink rather than white. This trick is performed by adding just a few lines\\nof code to the AttachedToWindow() routine defined in the MyDrawView.cpp file\\nin the RGBColor project. Here an rgb_color variable is set up to define the color\\npink, and that variable is used as the argument to a call to SetViewColor().\\nHere\\'s\\nthe\\nnew\\nversion\\nof\\nthe\\nMyDrawView member\\nfunction\\nAttachedToWindow():\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nSetViewColor(pinkColor);\\n}\\n\\nColor Control View\\nThe RGB components of any given color won\\'t be known by a program\\'s user.\\nThere are exceptions, of course--graphics artists involved in electronic media or\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nelectronic publications may have a working knowledge of how RGB values correspond to colors. Those exceptions aside, if your program allows users to select\\ntheir own colors, your program should provide a very user-friendly means for\\nthem to accomplish this task. The BColorControl class does just that.\\nColor levels and the BColorControl object\\nThe BColorControl class is derived from the BControl class, which itself is\\nderived from the BView class. So a BColorControl object is a type of view. Your\\nprogram creates a BColorControl object in order to allow a user to select an\\nRGB color without the user knowing anything about the RGB color system or RGB\\nvalues.\\nWhat the BColorControl object displays to the user depends on the number of\\ncolors the user\\'s monitor is currently displaying. The user can set that parameter\\nby choosing Screen from the preferences menu in the Deskbar. Coincidentally, the\\nScreen preferences window (which has been revamped and turned into the Background preferences application) itself holds a BColorControl object. So you can\\nsee how the monitor\\'s color depth is set and take a look at a BColorControl\\nobject by selecting the Screen preferences or by simply looking at Figure 5-2.\\n\\nFigure 5-2. The Screen preferences program set to display 8-bit color\\n\\nThe Screen preferences window holds a number of objects representing BViewderived classes. Among them is a pop-up menu titled Colors. In Figure 5-2, you\\nsee that I have my monitor set to devote 8 bits of graphics memory to each pixel,\\nso my monitor can display up to 256 colors. The Screen preferences window lets\\nme choose one of the 256 system colors to be used as my desktop color. This is\\ndone by clicking on one of the 256 small colored squares. This matrix, or block of\\nsquares, is a BColorControl object.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nChoosing 32-Bits/Pixel from the Colors pop-up menu in the Screen preferences\\nwindow sets a monitor to display any of millions of colors. As shown in\\nFigure 5-3, doing so also changes the look of the BColorControl object. Now a\\ncolor is selected by clicking on the red, green, and blue ramps, or bands, of color\\nalong the bottom of the Screen preferences window. Unbeknownst to the user,\\ndoing this sets up an RGB color. The Screen preferences program combines the\\nuser\\'s three color choices and uses the resulting RGB value as the desktop color.\\n\\nFigure 5-3. The Screen preferences program set to display 32-bit color\\n\\nCreating a BColorControl object\\nThe Screen preferences window serves as a good example of how a\\nBColorControl object can help the user. To use the class in your own program,\\ndeclare a BColorControl object and the variables that will be used as parameters to the BColorControl constructor. Then create the new object using new and\\nthe BColorControl constructor:\\nBColorControl\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\n*aColorControl;\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_16x16;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\naColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(aColorControl);\\n\\nThe first BColorControl constructor parameter, leftTop, indicates where the top\\nleft corner of the color control should appear. The color control will be placed in\\na view (by calling the AddChild() function of the host view, as shown above), so\\nyou should set BPoint\\'s coordinates relative to the view\\'s borders.\\nThe second parameter, matrix, is of the Be-defined datatype color_control_\\nlayout. When the user has the monitor set to 8 bits per pixel, the 256 system colors are displayed in a matrix. This parameter specifies how these squares should\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nbe arranged. Use one of five Be-defined constants here: B_CELLS_4x64, B_\\nCELLS_8x32, B_CELLS_16x16, B_CELLS_32x8, or B_CELLS_64x4. The two numbers in each constant name represent the number of columns and rows, respectively, that the colored squares are placed in. For example, B_CELLS_32x8 displays the 256 colors in eight rows with 32 colored squares in each row.\\nThe third BColorControl constructor parameter, cellSide, determines the pixel\\nsize of each colored square in the matrix. A value of 10, for instance, results in 256\\nsquares that are each 10 pixels by 10 pixels in size.\\nThe fourth parameter provides a name for the BColorControl object. Like any\\nview, a BColorControl object has a name that can be used to find the view. The\\nname can be supplied using a string (as shown in the previous snippet) or by\\npassing in a constant variable that was defined as a const char * (as in const\\nchar *name = \"ColorControl\";).\\nNote that the overall size of the BColorControl object isn\\'t directly specified in\\nthe constructor. The size is calculated by the constructor, and depends on the values supplied in the second and third parameters. The matrix parameter specifies\\nthe shape of the block of colors, while the cellSide value indirectly determines\\nthe overall size. A matrix with 8 rows of cells that are each 10 pixels high will\\nhave a height of 80 pixels, for instance.\\nI\\'ve discussed the BColorControl constructor parameters as if they will be used\\nwith 8-bit pixels. For the values used in the previous example, the resulting color\\ncontrol looks like the one displayed in the window in Figure 5-4. If the user\\ninstead has the monitor set to 32 bits for each pixel, the same arguments are used\\nin the display of four bands, three of which the user clicks on in order to create a\\nsingle color. The top gray band represents the alpha, or color transparency level,\\ncomponent. As of this writing, the alpha component is unimplemented, but it\\nshould be implemented by the time you read this. Instead of creating a matrix of\\ncolor squares, the arguments are now used to determine the shape and overall\\nsize the four bands occupy. Figure 5-5 shows the color control that results from\\nexecuting the previous snippet when the monitor is set to 32 bits per pixel.\\n\\nThe user can set the monitor to the desired bits-per-pixel level, so\\nyour program can\\'t count on being used for a matrix or bands. In\\nFigure 5-5, you see that the color bands are very broad--that\\'s the\\nresult of specifying a 16-by-16 matrix (B_CELLS_16x16). To display\\nlonger, narrower color bands, choose a different Be-defined constant for the BColorControl constructor matrix argument (such as\\nB_CELLS_64x4). Regardless of the values you choose for the\\nmatrix and cellSize parameters, test the resulting color control\\nunder both monitor settings to verify that the displayed control fits\\nwell in the window that displays it.\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\nUsing a color control\\nWhen a window displays a color control, the user selects a color by clicking on its\\ncell (if the user\\'s monitor is set to 8 bits per pixel) or by clicking on a color intensity in each of the three color component bands (if the user\\'s monitor is set to 32\\nbits per pixel). In either case, the BColorControl object always keeps track of\\nthe currently selected color. Your program can obtain this color at any time via a\\ncall to the BColorControl member function ValueAsColor(). Obviously\\nenough, a call to this routine returns the value of the color control object in the\\nform of an RGB color. In this next snippet, the user\\'s current color choice is\\nreturned and stored in an rgb_color variable named userColorChoice:\\nrgb_color\\n\\nuserColorChoice;\\n\\nuserColorChoice = aColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\n\\nWhat your program does with the returned color is application-specific. Just bear\\nin mind that this value can be used the same way any rgb_color is used. You\\nknow about the SetHighColor() routine that sets a view\\'s high color, and you\\'ve\\nseen how to fill a rectangle with the current high color by calling the BView member function FillRect(), so an example that carries on with the previous snippet\\'s userColorChoice RGB color will be easily understandable:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\nThe previous snippet creates a rectangle in the shape of a long horizontal bar, sets\\nthe high color to whatever color the user has the color control currently set at,\\nthen fills the rectangle with that color.\\nColorControl example project\\nIf you set your monitor to use 8 bits per pixel (using the Screen preferences utility), running this chapter\\'s ColorControl example program results in a window like\\nthe one shown in Figure 5-4. If you instead have your monitor set to use 32 bits\\nper pixel, running the same program displays a window like that shown in\\nFigure 5-5.\\nRegardless of your monitor\\'s pixel setting, the ColorControl program displays three\\ntext boxes to the right of the color matrix or color bands. These text boxes are displayed automatically by the BColorControl object, and the area they occupy\\nconstitutes a part of the total area occupied by the control. If you click on a color\\ncell or a color band, the numbers in these boxes will change to reflect the appropriate RGB values for the color you\\'ve selected. If you click in a text box (or use\\nthe Tab key to move to a text box) and type in a value between 0 and 255, the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-4. The ColorControl program\\'s window that results from running at 8-bit color\\n\\nFigure 5-5. The ColorControl program\\'s window that results from running at 32-bit color\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\n\\ncolor display will update itself to display the color that best matches the value\\nyou\\'ve entered. These actions are all automatic, and require no coding effort on\\nyour part. The reason this handy feature works is that the BControl class overrides the BView class member function KeyDown(), and in turn the\\nBColorControl class overrides the BControl version of KeyDown(). The\\nBColorControl version of the routine sees to it that the text box values reflect\\nthe displayed color.\\nIf you move the cursor out of the color control area (keep in mind that this area\\nincludes the text boxes), then click the mouse button, a long, narrow bar is drawn\\nalong the bottom of the window--as shown in Figures 5-4 and 5-5. The color of\\nthis bar will match whatever color you have currently selected in the color control. The selection of this color and the drawing of the bar are handled by the\\nMyDrawView version of the MouseDown() routine. Besides overriding the Bview\\nhook function MouseDown(), this project\\'s version of the MyDrawView class adds a\\nBColorControl data member. The color control data member will be used to\\nkeep track of the control. Here\\'s how the ColorControl project declares the\\nMyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\nvirtual\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\nprivate:\\nBColorControl\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n*fColorControl;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloApplication class and MyHelloWindow class are almost identical to\\nversions found in previous examples. The MyHelloApplication constructor\\ndefines the size of a window and creates a single MyHelloWindow, and the\\nMyHelloWindow defines a single MyDrawView whose size is the same as the window it resides in.\\nThe MyDrawView constructor, which in other projects has been empty, sets up and\\ncreates a color control. The control object is added to the newly created\\nMyDrawView object as a child:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout matrix = B_CELLS_16x16;\\nlong\\ncellSide = 16;\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n}\\n\\nIn the MyDrawView constructor, you see that the control will have its top left corner start 20 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the top of the MyDrawView\\nview that the control appears in. Starting down 50 pixels from the top of the view\\nleaves room for the two lines of instructional text that are displayed in the window (refer back to Figure 5-4 or 5-5). Those lines are drawn each time the system\\nhas to update the view they appear in:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\n}\\n\\nWhen the user clicks in the MyDrawView view, the MouseDown() routine that the\\nMyDrawView class overrides is automatically invoked:\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nBRect\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\n\\nMouseDown() creates the long, thin rectangle that appears along the bottom of the\\nview when the user clicks the mouse button. Before this function draws the rectangle with a call to FillRect(), a ValueAsColor() call obtains the color currently selected in the view\\'s color control. A call to SetHighColor() makes the\\nuser-selected color the one used in function calls that include B_SOLID_HIGH as a\\nparameter.\\nImproving the ColorControl example project\\nFor brevity, the ColorControl example sets the high color and fills in the colored\\nrectangle in the MouseDown() routine. Typically, drawing takes place only in a\\nview\\'s Draw() function. One way to accomplish that would be to move the code\\ncurrently in MouseDown() to Draw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\n\\x0cColors\\n\\nrgb_color\\n\\nuserColorChoice;\\n\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\n\\nThe body of MouseDown() could then consist of a single line of code: a call to the\\nBView function Invalidate(). Then, when the user clicks the mouse in the\\nMyDrawView view, MouseDown() makes the system aware of the fact that the view\\nneeds updating, and the system invokes Draw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nInvalidate();\\n}\\n\\nOne further improvement to the ColorControl example program would be to preserve the current state of the view before changing its high color. As implemented\\n(here and in the previous section), the text the program draws is drawn in black\\nthe first time the Draw() function executes. Subsequent calls will update any previously obscured text (as in the case when an overlapping window is moved off\\nthe ColorControl program\\'s window) in whatever color was selected by the user.\\nThat is, the program\\'s call to SetHighColor() affects not only the long, narrow\\ncolor rectangle at the bottom of the program\\'s window, but also text drawn with\\ncalls to DrawString(). To remedy this, preserve the state of the high color by\\ninvoking the BView function HighColor() to get the current high color before\\nchanging it. After calling SetHighColor() and FillRect(), use the rgb_color\\nvalue returned by HighColor() to reset the high color to its state prior to the use\\nof the user-selected color. Here\\'s how Draw() now looks:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nrgb_color origHighColor;\\nDrawString(\"Choose a color below, then move the cursor\");\\nDrawString(\"outside of the color control and click the mouse button\");\\norigHighColor = HighColor();\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nSetHighColor(origHighColor);\\n}\\n\\nPatterns\\nA pattern is an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel area. Each of the 64 pixels in this area has the\\ncolor of either the current high or current low color. A pattern can be one solid\\ncolor (by designating that all pixels in the pattern be only the current high color or\\nonly the current low color), or it can be any arrangement of the two colors, as in a\\ncheckerboard, stripes, and so forth. Regardless of the arrangement of the pixels\\nthat make up the pattern, it can be used to fill an area of any size. And regardless\\nof the size or shape of an area, once a pattern is defined it can be easily \"poured\"\\ninto this area to give the entire area the look of the pattern.\\n\\nBe-Defined Patterns\\nYou\\'ve already encountered three patterns--the Be-defined constants B_SOLID_\\nHIGH, B_SOLID_LOW, B_MIXED_COLORS each specify a specific arrangement of colors in an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel area. Here the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern is used to fill\\na rectangle with a checkerboard pattern made up of alternating current high and\\ncurrent low colors:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(aRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n\\nThe BView class defines a number of stroke and fill member functions. Each\\nstroke function (such as StrokeRect() and StrokePolygon()) outlines a shape\\nusing a specified pattern. Patterns have the greatest effect on the look of a shape\\noutline when the outline has a thickness greater than one pixel (setting the thickness at which lines are drawn is covered ahead in the \"The Drawing Pen\" section). Each fill function (such as FillRect() and FillPolygon()) fills a shape\\nusing a specified pattern. This may not be entirely obvious when looking at some\\nsource code snippets because these drawing routines make the pattern parameter\\noptional. When the pattern parameter is skipped, the function uses the B_SOLID_\\nHIGH pattern by default. So both of the following calls to FillRect() produce a\\nrectangle filled with a solid pattern in the current high color:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\\x0cPatterns\\n\\n\\nEarlier in this chapter, the example project RGBColor demonstrated the use of the\\nB_SOLID_HIGH, B_SOLID_LOW, and B_MIXED_COLORS constants by using these\\nconstants in the filling of three rectangles (see Figure 5-1). After setting the high\\ncolor to red and the low color to blue, the rectangle that was filled using the\\nB_MIXED_COLORS constant appeared to be purple. I say \"appeared to be purple\"\\nbecause, in fact, none of the pixels in the rectangle are purple. Instead, each is\\neither red or blue. Because the pixels alternate between these two colors, and\\nbecause pixel density is high on a typical monitor, the resulting rectangle appears\\nto the eye to be solid purple. Figure 5-6 illustrates this by showing the RGBColor\\nprogram\\'s window and the window of the pixel-viewing utility program Magnify.\\nThe Magnify program (which is a Be-supplied application that was placed on your\\nmachine during installation of the BeOS) shows an enlarged view of the pixels\\nsurrounding the cursor. In Figure 5-6, the cursor is over a part of the purple rectangle in the RGBColor window, and the pixels are displayed in the Magnify window.\\n\\nFigure 5-6. Using the Magnify program to view the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern\\n\\nApplication-Defined Patterns\\nThe three Be-defined patterns come in handy, but they don\\'t exploit the real\\npower of patterns. Your project can define a pattern that carries out precisely your\\nidea of what a shape should be filled with.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBit definition of a pattern\\nA pattern designates which of the 64 bits (8 rows of 8 bits) in an 8-pixel-by-8-pixel\\narea display the current high color and which display the current low color. Thus\\nthe specific colors displayed by the pattern aren\\'t designated by the pattern.\\nInstead, a pattern definition marks each of its 64 bits as either a 1 to display the\\nhigh color or a 0 to display the low color. The colors themselves come from the\\nhigh and low colors at the time the pattern is used in drawing.\\nA pattern is specified by listing the hexadecimal values of the eight bits that make\\nup each row of the pattern. Consider the pattern shown in Figure 5-7. Here I show\\nthe 8-by-8 grid for a pattern that produces a diagonal stripe. You can do the same\\nusing a pencil and graph paper. Each cell represents one pixel, with a filled-in cell\\nconsidered on, or 1, and an untouched cell considered off, or 0. Since a pattern\\ndefines only on and off, not color, this technique works fine regardless of the colors to be used when drawing with the pattern.\\n\\nFigure 5-7. The binary and hexadecimal representations of a pattern\\n\\nThe left side of Figure 5-7 shows the binary representation of each row in the pattern, with a row chunked into groups of four bits. The right side of the figure\\nshows the corresponding hexadecimal values for each row. Looking at the top\\nrow, from left to right, the pixels are on/on/off/off, or binary 1100. The second set\\nof four pixels in the top row has the same value. A binary value of 1100 is hexadecimal c, so the binary pair translates to the hexadecimal pair cc. The hexadecimal values for each remaining row are determined in the same manner. If you\\'re\\nproficient at working with hexadecimal values, you can skip the intermediate\\nbinary step and write the hexadecimal value for each row by simply looking at the\\npixels in groups of four.\\nRow by row, the hexadecimal values for the pattern in Figure 5-7 are: cc, 66, 33,\\n99, cc, 66, 33, 99. Using the convention of preceding a hexadecimal value with 0x,\\nthe pattern specification becomes: 0xcc, 0x66, 0x33, 0x99, 0xcc, 0x66, 0x33, 0x99.\\n\\x0cPatterns\\n\\n\\nThe pattern datatype\\nUsing the previous method to define a pattern isn\\'t just an exercise in your knowledge of hexadecimal numbers, of course! Instead, you\\'ll use a pattern\\'s eight hexadecimal pairs in assigning a pattern variable. Here\\'s how Be defines the\\npattern datatype:\\ntypedef struct {\\n} pattern;\\n\\nEach of the eight elements in the pattern array is one byte in size, so each can\\nhold a single unsigned value in the range of 0 to 255. Each of the hexadecimal\\npairs in each of the eight rows in a pattern falls into this range (0x00 = 0, 0xff =\\n255). To create a pattern variable, determine the hexadecimal pairs for the pattern (as shown above) and assign the variable those values. Here I\\'m doing that\\nfor the pattern I designed back in Figure 5-7:\\npattern\\n\\n\\nThis is also how Be defines its three built-in patterns. The B_SOLID_HIGH pattern\\nis one that has all its bits set to 1, or on; the B_SOLID_LOW pattern has all its bits\\nset to 0, or off; and the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern has its bits set to alternate\\nconst pattern B_SOLID_HIGH\\nconst pattern B_SOLID_LOW\\n\\nUsing a pattern variable\\nOnce initialized, a variable of type pattern is used just as one of the Be-defined\\npattern constants--pass the variable as an argument to any routine that requires a\\npattern as a parameter. The following snippet defines a pattern variable and two\\nrectangle variables. The code then fills one rectangle with a solid color and the\\nother with diagonal stripes:\\npattern\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(solidRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nFillRect(stripedRect, stripePattern);\\n\\nBecause the previous snippet doesn\\'t include any code that hints at the current\\nstate of the high and low colors, you can\\'t infer what colors will be in the resulting rectangles--you know only that one will have a solid fill while the other will\\nhave diagonal stripes running through it.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nPattern example project\\nThe Pattern project builds a program that displays a window with a single rectangle drawn in it. The rectangle is filled with the diagonal stripe pattern that was\\nintroduced on the preceding pages. Figure 5-8 shows the Pattern program\\'s window. Also shown is the Magnify program\\'s window as it displays an enlarged view\\nof some of the pixels in the Pattern program\\'s filled rectangle.\\n\\nFigure 5-8. Using the Magnify program to view the application-defined pattern\\n\\nAs is the case for many of this chapter\\'s remaining examples, the Pattern project\\nwas created by starting with a recent project (such as the RGBColor project) and\\naltering the code in just one of the routines--the Draw() member function of the\\nMyDrawView class. Here\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nFillRect(aRect, stripePattern);\\n}\\n\\nYou can experiment with the Pattern project by adding color to the rectangle. Precede the call to FillRect() with a call to SetHighColor(), SetLowColor(), or\\nboth. Changing the current high color will change the color of what are presently\\n\\x0cThe Drawing Pen\\n\\n\\nthe black stripes, while changing the current low color will change the color of\\nwhat are presently the white stripes.\\n\\nThe Drawing Pen\\nWhenever drawing takes place, the pen is at work. The pen is a way to summarize and express two properties of a view\\'s drawing environment. When drawing\\nstarts, it starts at some specific location in a view. When line drawing takes place,\\nthe line has some specific thickness to it. These traits are stored in a view and can\\nbe altered by invoking BView member functions. In keeping with the analogy of\\ndrawing with a pen, the names of these routines include the word \"pen.\"\\n\\nPen Location\\nThe location of the rectangle drawn by Fillrect() has been previously established during the setting up of the rectangle:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nFillRect(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n\\nFor the drawing of text and lines, this isn\\'t the case. Typically, you\\'ll move the pen\\nto the location where drawing is to start, then draw.\\nMoving the pen\\nWhen it\\'s said that the pen is moved, what\\'s actually taking place is that a call sets\\nthe starting location for subsequent drawing. Moving the pen doesn\\'t have any visible effect--nothing gets drawn. To move the pen, invoke the view\\'s\\nMovePenTo() or MovePenBy() function.\\nThe MovePenTo() function accepts either a single BPoint argument or a pair of\\nfloating-point arguments. In either case, the result is that the arguments specify the\\ncoordinate at which the next act of drawing starts. The first argument to\\nMovePenTo() is the horizontal coordinate to move to, while the second argument\\nis the vertical coordinate. The movement is relative to the view\\'s origin. Each of\\nthe following four calls to MovePenTo() has the same result--drawing will be set\\nto start at pixel (30.0, 40.0) in the view\\'s system coordinate:\\nBPoint\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nx = 30.0;\\ny = 40.0;\\n\\nMovePenTo(aPoint);\\nMovePenTo(x, y);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nLike MovePenTo(), the MovePenBy() function moves the starting location for\\ndrawing. MovePenTo() moves the pen relative to the view\\'s origin. MovePenBy()\\nmoves the pen relative to its current location in the view. Consider this snippet:\\n\\nThe call to MovePenTo() moves the pen to the location 30 pixels from the left of\\nthe view and 40 pixels from the top of the view. That places the pen at the point\\n(30.0, 40.0). The call to MovePenBy() uses this current location as the reference\\nand moves the pen 70 pixels to the left and 10 pixels down. The result is that, relative to the view\\'s origin, the pen is at the point (100.0, 50.0).\\nNegative values for MovePenBy() move the pen \"backwards\" in the view. A negative horizontal argument moves the pen to the left, while a negative vertical argument moves the pen up. Because MovePenTo() specifies a particular coordinate\\nto end up at rather than a direction to move in, negative values shouldn\\'t be\\npassed as the arguments of this routine.\\nMovePen example project\\nAs shown in Figure 5-9, the MovePen project results in a program that displays a\\nwindow with three characters written to it. I\\'ve added coordinate information to\\nthe figure--the arrows and values aren\\'t actually displayed in the window.\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\n\\nC\\n\\nFigure 5-9. The window that results from running the MovePen program\\n\\nWhere the characters \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" get drawn in the window depends on calls\\nto the MovePenTo() and MovePenBy() functions. To get a good feel for working\\nwith a view\\'s coordinate system, edit the arguments to the existing function calls in\\nthe Draw() routine, or add additional calls to MovePenTo() and MovePenBy():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cThe Drawing Pen\\n\\n\\nDrawString(\"A\");\\nDrawString(\"B\");\\nDrawString(\"C\");\\n}\\n\\nPen Size\\nThe pen is used to draw shape outlines. Chapter 4 introduced the BView member\\nfunction StrokeRect(), which draws the outline of a rectangle. Here a 100-pixelby-100-pixel rectangle is framed in a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see later in this chapter, there are a number of BView StrokeXxx()\\nmember functions, each of which outlines a particular shape. All of these functions are affected by the current size of the pen.\\nSetting the pen size\\nBy default, the pen can be thought of as having a tip that is the size of a single\\npixel. Thus, drawing with the pen produces a line with a thickness of one pixel.\\nYou can change the size or thickness of the pen at any time by invoking the\\nBView member function SetPenSize(). This routine accepts a single argument,\\nthe new pixel thickness for the pen. In this next snippet, the same rectangle that\\nwas outlined in the previous snippet is given a frame, or border, three pixels thick.\\nThe lines you specify to be drawn are in the center of the pixels in a thick pen.\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nSetting the pen size for a view affects all subsequent calls to StrokeXxx() functions. After changing the pen size and invoking a StrokeXxx() function, you may\\nwant to reset the pen size to a thickness of a single pixel:\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n\\nGetting the pen size\\nThe best process to use when altering the pen size is to obtain and save the current pen size, change it, perform the desired drawing using the new pen size, then\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nrestore the pen to the saved size. The BView member function PenSize() allows\\nyou to do that. When invoked, PenSize() returns a float that holds the current\\nthickness of the pen. This next snippet provides an example of the use of\\nPenSize():\\nfloat\\n\\nsavedPenSize;\\n\\nsavedPenSize = PenSize();\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\nSetPenSize(savedPenSize);\\n\\nPenSize example project\\nThe PenSize project displays a window that holds six rectangles. As shown in\\nFigure 5-10, the thickness of the outline of each rectangle differs.\\n\\nFigure 5-10. The window that results from running the PenSize program\\n\\nAs is becoming a habit, the Draw() function of the MyDrawView class does the\\nexample\\'s work. The function begins by defining and setting six rectangles. Each\\nrectangle has a width of 40 pixels and a height of 80 pixels. The outline thickness\\nof each rectangle differs due to the call to SetPenSize() that precedes each call\\nto StrokeRect():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\n\\nShapes\\nBe claims that the BeOS is an operating system for the graphics community. So it\\'s\\nhoped that the BeOS makes it easy for programmers to support the drawing of\\nboth simple and complex shapes. And, of course, it does.\\n\\nPoints and Lines\\nDrawing a line or lines is drawing at its most basic level. Points are used in specifying where a line should be drawn within a view.\\nThe BPoint class\\nA point is represented by a BPoint object. The BPoint object consists of two\\nfloating point values, one denoting an x or horizontal coordinate and the other\\ndefining a y or vertical coordinate. On a monitor, this coordinate pair matches one\\nparticular pixel.\\nA BPoint object can have values assigned to its coordinate pair members either at\\nthe time of declaration or anytime thereafter. At declaration, one of the BPoint\\nconstructors can be used to take care of the task of assigning values to the BPoint\\nmembers:\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\nTo assign coordinates after the object\\'s declaration, either use the BPoint member function Set() or assign values directly to the x and y data members:\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nNote the lack of the use of new in the previous line of code, and the direct assignment of values to an object\\'s data members. The point is basic to drawing operations, so Be has defined the BPoint to act like a basic datatype rather than a class.\\nThe declaration of a BPoint is all that\\'s needed to actually create a BPoint object.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBecause the BPoint data members are declared public, direct access is allowed.\\nYou\\'ve seen a similar situation with the BRect class as well.\\nLine drawing\\nUnlike BPoint, the BeOS defines no BLine class to represent lines. Instead, line\\ndrawing takes place using the BView member function StrokeLine(). When\\ninvoking this function, you can use a pair of BPoint objects to specify the start\\nand end points of a line, or a single BPoint object to specify just the line\\'s end\\npoint. If only the end point is specified, the current pen location in the view is\\nused as the start point. Both types of call to StrokeLine() are demonstrated\\nhere:\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the previous snippet, two lines are drawn. The first is a horizontal line 100 pixels in length that is drawn from the point (50.0, 50.0) to the point (150.0, 50). The\\nsecond is a vertical line 50 pixels in length that is drawn from the point (20.0, 200.\\n0) to the point (20.0, 250.0).\\nBoth versions of StrokeLine() offer a final optional parameter that specifies a\\npattern in which the line is drawn. The following snippet draws lines of the same\\nlength and location as the previous snippet (assume the same BPoint variables\\nare declared). Here, however, the horizontal line is red and the vertical line is\\ngreen:\\nrgb_color\\nrgb_color\\n\\nredColor\\n\\nSetHighColor(redColor);\\nSetLowColor(greenColor);\\n\\nYou aren\\'t limited to the Be-defined patterns--any pattern can be used as an argument to StrokeLine(). In this next snippet, the diagonal stripe pattern discussed\\nearlier in this chapter is used. The high color is set to red, and the low color is left\\nin its default state of white. Additionally, the pen size is set to 10.0. The result is a\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nline 10 pixels in thickness with diagonal red stripes running through it.

After drawing\\nthe line, the pen is first moved to the line\\'s start point, and then moved down a\\nnumber of pixels. StrokeLine() is called again, this time to draw a diagonal line\\nthat ends at the same point where the first line ended.\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-12.

But they are also instrumental in\\nthe definition of other shapes, including round rectangles, ellipses, and regions--\\nas you\\'ll see ahead.\\nSetting a rectangle\\nA BRect object has four data members of type float: left, top, right, and\\nbottom. Each data member specifies a pixel location that defines one of the four\\nedges of a rectangle. The values of the left and right members are relative to\\nthe left edge of the view that is to hold the rectangle, while the values of the top\\nand bottom members are relative to the top edge of the view.\\nUpon declaration, the boundaries of a BRect object can be set by specifying values for each of the four data members or by listing two points--one of which\\nspecifies the rectangle\\'s top left corner while the other specifies the rectangle\\'s\\nbottom right corner. In this next snippet, both of the BRect objects would have\\nthe same boundaries:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\x0cShapes\\nBPoint\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nA rectangle\\'s data members can also be set after the BRect object\\'s declaration.\\nAgain, the following rectangle shares the same coordinates as the previous two:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\naRect.left\\naRect.top\\naRect.right\\naRect.bottom\\n\\n\\nA more efficient means of achieving the above result is to use the BRect member\\nfunction Set(). The order of the values passed to Set() is left, top, right,\\nbottom:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nLike a point, which is represented by a BPoint object, a rectangle is considered\\nbasic to drawing. The BRect class is set up so that a BRect object is created upon\\ndeclaration of a BRect. Additionally, the BRect data members are public, so they\\ncan be accessed either directly or via member functions such as Set(). In short,\\nBRect objects and BPoint objects can and should be created on the stack\\n(declared locally).\\nDrawing a rectangle\\nIn Chapter 4, you saw that shape drawing is achieved by invoking a BView member function. There, StrokeRect() was called to draw a framing rectangle around\\na view. In this chapter, you\\'ve already seen that a rectangle is filled by calling\\nFillRect(). Both routines accept as an argument a previously set up rectangle.\\nThis snippet calls StrokeRect() to frame one rectangle, then calls FillRect()\\nto fill a smaller rectangle centered within the first:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nStrokeRect(outerRect);\\nFillRect(innerRect);\\n\\nBoth StrokeRect() and FillRect() accept an optional pattern parameter.\\nHere the rectangles just defined are drawn with a black and white checkerboard\\npattern:\\nStrokeRect(outerRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\nFillRect(innerRect, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nRectangles example project\\nThe Rectangles project displays a window consisting of the rectangles shown in\\nFigure 5-13.\\n\\nFigure 5-13. The window that results from running the Rectangles program\\n\\nThe left rectangle consists of many nested, or inset, rectangles. The MyDrawView\\nmember function Draw() sets up what will be the outermost rectangle shown.\\nAfter the BRect object\\'s boundaries are set, a for loop insets and draws each rectangle. The BRect member function InsetBy() creates the desired inset effect by\\nadjusting the values of the data members of the calling BRect object. After fifteen\\nrectangles are framed one inside the other, a solid black rectangle is drawn to the\\nright of the window:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i = 0; i < 15; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nFillRect(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nRound rectangles\\nA rectangle with rounded corners is a shape that appears in both user-interface\\nelements (most buttons are round rectangles) and everyday objects (picture some\\nof the boxes in a flow chart). You can use the BView member function\\nStrokeRoundRect() to take an \"ordinary\" rectangle--a BRect object--and provide a degree of rounding to each of its corners.\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nIn StrokeRoundRect(), the first argument is a previously set up rectangle. The\\nsecond and third StrokeRoundRect() parameters specify the amount of rounding to be applied to each corner. Together these two parameters specify the shape\\nof an ellipse; the second parameter establishes the ellipse radius along the x-axis,\\nwhile the third parameter establishes the ellipse radius along the y-axis. Think of\\nsetting an ellipse in each corner of the rectangle and drawing only one quarter of\\nthe ellipse in order to form a rounded corner. The following snippet demonstrates\\na call to StrokeRoundRect():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nTo fill a round rectangle, call the BView member function FillRoundRect(). The\\nparameters to this function match those used in StrokeRoundRect():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\n\\nLike other BView drawing routines, both StrokeRoundRect() and\\nFillRoundRect() accept an optional pattern argument. Omitting this argument\\ntells the view to use B_SOLID_HIGH.\\n\\nEllipses\\nYou\\'ve seen that a line isn\\'t represented by a class, but is instead drawn using a\\nBView member function. A similar situation exists for an ellipse. And like a round\\nrectangle, an ellipse is specified using a rectangle.\\nDrawing an ellipse\\nAfter defining a rectangle, an ellipse is drawn by inscribing an oval within the\\nboundaries of the rectangle. The rectangle itself isn\\'t drawn--it simply serves to\\nspecify the size of the ellipse. A circle, of course, is an ellipse whose height and\\nwidth are equal.\\nThe BView member function StrokeEllipse() does the drawing:\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nStrokeEllipse(aRect);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nAn ellipse can be filled by the BView member function FillEllipse():\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nFillEllipse(aRect);\\n\\nBy default, an ellipse is outlined or filled using a solid pattern and the current high\\ncolor. As with other BView drawing routines, a call to either StrokeEllipse() or\\nFillEllipse() can include an optional second parameter that specifies a different pattern.\\nAn alternate method of specifying the boundaries of an ellipse is to supply\\nStrokeEllipse() or FillEllipse() with a center point and an x-axis and\\ny-axis radius. The next snippet draws a single ellipse that is both outlined and\\nfilled. A call to SetLowColor() sets the low color to blue. The subsequent call to\\nFillEllipse() draws an ellipse that is filled with a black and blue checkerboard pattern. Specifying the B_MIXED_COLORS pattern in the call to\\nFillEllipse() tells the routine to fill the ellipse with a checkerboard pattern that\\nalternates the current high color (by default, black) with the current low color\\n(which was just set to blue). The call to StrokeEllipse() relies on the current\\nhigh color (black) to outline the ellipse in a solid pattern (B_SOLID_HIGH, since\\nno pattern was specified). Note that when both filling and outlining a single ellipse\\nit\\'s important to call the StrokeEllipse() routine after calling FillEllipse().\\nIf the calling order is reversed, the call to FillEllipse() will obscure whatever\\noutline was drawn by the call to StrokeEllipse():\\nrgb_color\\nBPoint\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nxRadius = 40.0;\\nyRadius = 60.0;\\n\\nSetLowColor(blueColor);\\nFillEllipse(center, xRadius, yRadius, B_MIXED_COLORS);\\nStrokeEllipse(center, xRadius, yRadius);\\n\\nPolygons\\nA polygon is a closed shape with straight sides. Unlike a rectangle, which consists\\nof sides that must be vertical and horizontal, a polygon can include sides that run\\ndiagonally.\\nSetting up a polygon\\nThe BPolygon class is used to create objects that represent polygons. When creating a new BPolygon object, pass the BPolygon constructor an array of BPoints\\nthat specify the points that make up the vertices of the polygon, along with an\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nint32 value that specifies how many points are in the array. Here\\'s how a\\nBPolygon object representing a three-sided polygon might be defined:\\nBPoint\\nBPolygon\\n\\nnumPoints = 3;\\n*aPolygon;\\n\\naPolygon = new BPolygon(pointArray, numPoints);\\n\\nThe previous snippet creates an array of three BPoint objects. The coordinates of\\neach BPoint object are then assigned by calling the BPoint member function\\nSet(). Next, new is used to create a new BPolygon object whose vertices are\\ndefined by the BPoints in the pointArray array.\\nAlternatively, a BPolygon can be created without immediately defining its vertices. In this case, the polygon can be defined later by calling the BPolygon member function AddPoints(), which adds an array of BPoint objects to the\\nBPolygon object. Here, the same polygon that was defined in the previous snippet is again defined--this time using a call to AddPoints():\\nBPoint\\nBPolygon\\n\\nnumPoints = 3;\\n*aPolygon;\\n\\naPolygon = new BPolygon();\\naPolygon->AddPoints(pointArray, numPoints);\\n\\nDrawing a polygon\\nOnce a BPolygon object is defined, its outline can be drawn by calling the BView\\nmember function StrokePolygon(), or it can be filled in with the BView member function FillPolygon(). If the following call to StrokePolygon() is made\\nafter either of the previous two snippets execute, the result is an outlined triangle.\\nStrokePolygon(aPolygon);\\n\\nNote that StrokePolygon() draws the lines of the polygon\\'s edges starting at the\\nfirst point in the array, and finishes by closing the polygon with a line from the\\nlast point back to the first point. Thus, the previous call to StrokePolygon()\\ndraws the following three lines.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA call to FillPolygon() fills the previously defined polygon with a pattern. Here\\nthe triangle polygon is filled with the default pattern of B_SOLID_HIGH:\\nFillPolygon(aPolygon);\\n\\nAs you\\'ve come to expect from the BView StrokeXxx() and FillXxx() routines, both StrokePolygon() and FillPolygon() may include an optional pattern polygon that specifies a pattern to use for the outline or fill of the polygon.\\nFinally, you can include yet one more optional parameter in the polygon drawing\\nroutines--a bool value that indicates whether the final shape-closing line should\\nor shouldn\\'t be drawn. By default, this line is drawn to finish up the polygon. If\\nfalse is passed, a series of connected lines rather than a polygon will be drawn.\\nDrawing a triangle\\nOn the previous pages you saw how to define and draw a triangle using a\\nBPolygon object. The BeOS also provides a shortcut for working with this special\\ncase of a polygon. It\\'s useful because so many 3D objects are built from dozens of\\ntiny triangles. Instead of defining an array of points and adding those points to a\\nBPolygon object, you can forego the both these steps and simply call one of two\\nBView member functions: StrokeTriangle() or FillTriangle(). Pass the\\nthree BPoint objects that define the triangle\\'s vertices. Here, the same triangle that\\nwas drawn using a BPolygon object is drawn using a call to StrokeTriangle():\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\nBPoint\\n\\n\\n\\nAs expected, FillTriangle() is invoked in the same manner as\\nStrokeTriangle(). Again as expected, both functions accept an optional pattern parameter.\\n\\nRegions\\nA region groups a number of rectangles together into a single BRegion object.\\nThis object can then be manipulated as a unitrotated, colored, and so forth. The\\nrectangles that make up a region can vary in size, and can be defined such that\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nthey form one continuous shape or any number of seemingly unrelated shapes. In\\nFigure 5-14, a window has been divided into four areas. Each area holds a single\\nregion. That last point is worthy of repeating: the window holds four regions. The\\nrectangles in the area at the bottom left of the window don\\'t form a single, solid\\narea, but because they\\'ve been marked to all be a part of a single BRegion object,\\nthey collectively make up a single region. The same applies to the rectangles in\\nthe lower right area of the window.\\n\\nFigure 5-14. A window displaying four regions\\n\\nSetting up a region\\nTo set up a region, first create a new BRegion object. Then define a rectangle and\\nadd that rectangle to the BRegion. In the following snippet, two rectangles are\\ndefined and added to a BRegion object named aRegion:\\nBRect\\nBRegion\\n\\naRect;\\n*aRegion;\\n\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\n\\nDrawing a region\\nCreating a region and adding rectangles to it defines the area (or areas) the region\\noccupies. It doesn\\'t, however, display the region in a view. To do that, invoke the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nBView member function FillRegion(). Here, the region that was created in the\\nprevious snippet is filled with the default B_SOLID_HIGH pattern:\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\n\\nThe BRegion object keeps track of all of the constituent rectangles and is responsible for filling each. Like other FillXxx() functions FillRegion() allows you\\nto specify an optional pattern.\\n\\nThere is no StrokeRegion() member function in the BView class.\\nBecause a region can consist of any number of overlapping rectangles, outlining each individual rectangle would result in lines running through the contents of the region.\\n\\nTesting for inclusion in a region\\nOne important use of a region is to test where a point lies within an area. If a\\npoint lies in any one of the rectangles that defines a region, that point is considered a part of, or belonging to, the region. To test a point for inclusion in a region,\\ncall the BRegion member function Contains(). Pass this routine the BPoint\\nobject to test, and Contains() will return a bool value that indicates whether or\\nnot the tested point lies within the region. In this next snippet, a region consisting\\nof just a single rectangle is defined. A point is then defined and tested for inclusion in this region:\\nBRect\\nBRegion\\nBPoint\\n\\n*aRegion;\\n\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\nif (aRegion->Contains(aPoint))\\n// do something\\nelse\\n// do something else\\n\\nRegion example project\\nThe Region project results in a program that displays a window like the one\\nshown in Figure 5-15.\\nThe dark area in Figure 5-15 represents a single region composed of three\\nrectangles. The MyDrawView member function Draw() defines and adds each\\nrectangle in turn to the BRegion object. After all of the rectangles have been\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\nFigure 5-15. The window that results from running the Region program\\n\\nadded, FillRegion() is called to fill the entire region with the default pattern of\\nB_SOLID_HIGH:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nBRegion *aRegion;\\naRegion = new BRegion();\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\naRegion->Include(aRect);\\nFillRegion(aRegion);\\n}\\n\\nRegion point testing example project\\nWhile the region shown in Figure 5-15 is filled, it doesn\\'t have to be. By omitting a\\ncall to FillRegion(), it\\'s possible to define a region without making it visible.\\nOne practical reason for doing this is for testing mouse button hits. If your program needs to find out whether the user clicked in a particular area of a window--even a very irregularly shaped area--a region that includes the entire area\\nto test can be set up. The BRegion class includes a routine that tests for the inclusion of a BPoint. The BView member function MouseDown() provides your application with a BPoint object that holds the pixel location of the cursor at the time\\nof a mouse button click. By overriding a view\\'s MouseDown() function and implementing it such that it compares the cursor location with the area of the region,\\nyour program can easily respond to mouse button clicks in an area of any shape.\\nThe RegionTest project creates a program that draws a region to a window--the\\nsame region created by the Region example project and pictured in Figure 5-15.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nWhat\\'s been added is the ability to test for a mouse button click in the region. If\\nthe user clicks anywhere in the dark area, the system beep is played. Clicking in\\nthe window but outside of the region produces no effect.\\nTo let the MyDrawView view (which occupies the entire area of the window it\\nresides in) respond to mouse button clicks, the program overrides MouseDown().\\nTo enable a MyDrawView object to keep track of its region, a BRegion object has\\nbeen added as a private data member in the MyDrawView class. Here\\'s the new\\ndeclaration of the MyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBRegion\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\nMouseDown(BPoint point);\\n\\n*fThreeRectRegion;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIn the previous example (the Region project), the region was set up in the Draw()\\nfunction. Because in that project the MyDrawView class didn\\'t retain the information about the region (it didn\\'t define a BRegion object as a data member), it was\\nnecessary to recalculate the region\\'s area each time the view it resided in needed\\nupdating. Now that the view retains this information, the BRegion needs to be set\\nup only once. The MyDrawView constructor is used for that purpose:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nfThreeRectRegion = new BRegion();\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\nfThreeRectRegion->Include(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nWith the BRegion construction moved to the MyDrawView constructor, the implementation of the MyDrawView member function Draw() is reduced to nothing\\nmore than a call to FillRegion():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\nFillRegion(fThreeRectRegion);\\n\\n}\\n\\nImplementing the MouseDown() routine for the MyDrawView class is as easy as\\ncomparing the cursor location (supplied by the system when it automatically\\ninvokes MouseDown()) to the area of the region. The BRegion member function\\nContains() handles that task:\\nvoid MyDrawView::MouseDown(BPoint point)\\n{\\nif (fThreeRectRegion->Contains(point))\\nbeep();\\n}\\n\\nIf the cursor is over any part of the region when the mouse button is clicked, the\\ncomputer beeps. Your more sophisticated program will of course find something\\nmore interesting to do in response to the user clicking the mouse button in a\\nregion!\\n\\nPictures\\nNow that you know about the myriad shapes the BeOS allows you to draw, you\\'ll\\nappreciate the BPicture class. A BPicture object consists of any number of\\nshapes of any type. Once defined, this combination of one, two, or hundreds of\\nshapes can be quickly drawn and redrawn with a single function call.\\nSetting up a picture\\nA picture object is created by using new to allocate memory for an empty, temporary BPicture. The creation of the new object takes place within a call to the\\nBView member function BeginPicture(). Doing so instructs the view to store\\nthe results of subsequent calls to BView drawing functions in the picture object, as\\nopposed to drawing the results of the calls to the view (as is normally the case).\\nWhen the picture is considered complete, the BView member function\\nEndPicture() is called. This routine returns the completed temporary picture\\nobject. This temporary object should be assigned to an application-defined\\nBPicture object. The following snippet provides an example:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nFillRect(aRect);\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFor simplicity, the previous snippet defines a picture that consists of a small filledin rectangle and a short, horizontal line. Your own pictures may prove to be far\\nmore complex. In particular, you\\'ll want to include calls such as SetFont(),\\nSetPenSize(), and so forth in order to set up the drawing environment appropriate to your drawing. If such calls aren\\'t made, the state of the view\\'s drawing environment at the time the picture is created will be used when the picture is later\\ndrawn.\\n\\nThe previous snippet indents the code between the\\nBeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls for purely aesthetic reasons. Doing so isn\\'t necessary, but it does make it obvious just what\\ncode the picture object consists of.\\n\\nCompleting a picture by calling EndPicture() doesn\\'t prohibit you from adding\\nto that same picture at a later time. To add to an existing BPicture object, pass\\nthat object to BeginPicture() and start drawing. After calling EndPicture(),\\nthe new drawing code will be a part of the existing picture. Here the previous picture-creating snippet is repeated. After the picture is completed, it is reopened and\\na vertical line is added to it:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nFillRect(aRect);_\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n...\\n...\\nBeginPicture(aPicture);\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\nDrawing a picture\\nOnce defined, a picture is drawn by invoking the BView member function\\nDrawPicture(). Just pass the picture as the argument:\\nDrawPicture(aPicture);\\n\\nBefore calling DrawPicture(), specify the starting position of the picture by moving the pen to where the upper left corner should be. Alternately, a BPoint object\\ncan be passed to DrawPicture() to denote where drawing should start. Both\\n\\x0cShapes\\n\\n\\ntechniques are shown here. The result of executing the code will be two identical\\npictures, one beneath the other.\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\n// line and shape-drawing code here\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\nDrawPicture(aPicture);\\n\\nKeep in mind that if a picture hasn\\'t set up its drawing environment, the state of\\nthe view at the time the picture was created is used when the picture is drawn. If\\nthe view\\'s graphic state happened to be in its default state (a high color of black, a\\npen size of 1.0, and so forth), the drawing will be made as expected. However, if\\nany of the view\\'s graphic settings were altered at some point before the picture\\nwas created, the drawing of the picture may occur with unpredictable and undesirable effects. Consider the previous snippet. If a call to SetPenSize(10.0) had\\nbeen made somewhere before the call to BeginPicture(), any line drawing\\ndone by the aPicture picture would include lines with a thickness of 10 pixels.\\nThat most likely won\\'t be the desired effect. If the picture is to draw lines with a\\nthickness of 1 pixel, then a call to SetPenSize(1.0) should be made in the picture-defining code, like this:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*aPicture;\\n\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\n// line and shape-drawing code here\\naPicture = EndPicture();\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to keep track and reverse changes that are made to the drawing\\nenvironment by a picture. That is, after a call to EndPicture(), your code doesn\\'t\\nneed to restore the view\\'s environment to its pre-BeginPicture() state. That\\'s\\nbecause all environmental changes that are made between calls to\\nBeginPicture() and EndPicture() apply only to the picture, not to the view.\\nPicture example project\\nThe Picture project draws a number of cascading rectangles, as shown in\\nFigure 5-16.\\nFor this project I\\'ve added a private data member BPicture object named\\nfPicture to the MyDrawView class. In the MyDrawView member function\\nAttachedToWindow(), this picture is created and defined. A for loop is used to\\nset up the numerous offset rectangles that make up the picture.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 5: Drawing\\n\\nFigure 5-16. The window that results from running the Picture program\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i=0; i<80; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\n}\\n\\nWhile the temptation is to define the picture in the MyDrawView constructor (it is,\\nafter all, an initialization act), the code must instead appear in the\\nAttachedToWindow() routine. The BPicture definition relies on the current state\\nof the view the picture belongs to, and the view\\'s state isn\\'t completely set up\\nuntil AttachedToWindow() executes.\\nOnce the picture is set up and saved in the fPicture data member, a\\nMyDrawView object can make use of it. That\\'s done in the Draw() function, where\\na call to MovePenTo() ensures that the drawing will start in the top left corner of\\nthe view (and, because the view is the same size as the window, the top left corner of the window). A call to DrawPicture() performs the drawing:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nDrawPicture(fPicture);\\n}\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Introduction to\\nControls\\n Buttons\\n Picture Buttons\\n Checkboxes\\n Radio Buttons\\n Text Fields\\n Multiple Control\\nExample Project\\n\\n6.\\n\\nControls and\\nMessages\\n\\nA control is a graphic image that resides in a window and acts as a device that\\naccepts user input. The BeOS API includes a set of classes that make it easy to add\\ncertain predefined controls to a program. These standard controls include the button, checkbox, radio button, text field, and color control. There\\'s also a Be-defined\\nclass that allows you to turn any picture into a control. That allows you to create\\ncontrols that have the look of real-world devices such as switches and dials.\\nChapter 5, Drawing, described the color control and the BColorControl class\\nused to create such controls. This chapter discusses other control types and the\\nclasses used to create each. Also discussed is the BControl class, the class from\\nwhich all other control classes are derived.\\nWhen the user clicks on a control, the system responds by sending a message to\\nthe window that holds the control. This message indicates exactly which control\\nhas been clicked. The message is received by the window\\'s MessageReceived()\\nhook function, where it is handled. Since the BWindow version of\\nMessageReceived() won\\'t know how to go about responding to messages that\\noriginate from your controls, you\\'ll override this routine. Your application then\\ngains control of how such messages are handled, and can include any code necessary to carry out the task you want the control to perform. This chapter includes\\nexamples that demonstrate how to create controls and how to override\\nMessageReceived() such that the function handles mouse clicks on controls of\\nany of the standard types.\\n\\nIntroduction to Controls\\nWhen a BWindow object receives a message, it either handles the message itself or\\nlets one of its views handle it. To handle a message, the window invokes a\\nBWindow hook function. For example, a B_ZOOM message delivered to a window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nresults in that window invoking the BWindow hook function Zoom() to shrink or\\nenlarge the window. To allocate the handling of a message to one of its views, the\\nwindow passes the message to the affected view, and the view then invokes the\\nappropriate BView hook function. For example, a B_MOUSE_DOWN message results\\nin the affected view invoking the BView hook function MouseDown().\\nBesides being the recipient of system messages, a window is also capable of\\nreceiving application-defined messages. This lets you implement controls in your\\napplication\\'s windows. When you create a control (such as a button object from\\nthe BButton class), define a unique message type that becomes associated with\\nthat one control. Also, add the control to a window. When the user operates the\\ncontrol (typically by clicking on it, as for a button), the system passes the application-defined message to the window. How the window handles the message is\\ndetermined by the code you include in the BWindow member function\\nMessageReceived().\\n\\nControl Types\\nYou can include a number of different types of controls in your windows. Each\\ncontrol is created from a class derived from the abstract class BControl. The\\nBControl class provides the basic features common to all controls, and the\\nBControl-derived classes add capabilities unique to each control type. In this\\nchapter, you\\'ll read about the following control types:\\nButton\\nThe BButton class is used to create a standard button, sometimes referred to\\nas a push button. Clicking on a button results in some immediate action taking place.\\nPicture button\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a button that can have any size,\\nshape, and look to it. While picture buttons can have an infinite variety of\\nlooks, they act in the same manner as a push button--a mouse click results in\\nan action taking place.\\nCheckbox\\nThe BCheckBox class creates a checkbox. A checkbox has two states: on and\\noff. Clicking a checkbox always toggles the control to its opposite state or\\nvalue. Clicking on a checkbox usually doesn\\'t immediately impact the program. Instead, a program typically waits until some other action takes place\\n(such as the click of a certain push button) before gathering the current state\\nof the checkbox. At that time, some program setting or feature is adjusted\\nbased on the value in the checkbox.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nRadio button\\nThe BRadioButton class is used to create a radio button. Like a checkbox, a\\nradio button has two states: on and off. Unlike a checkbox, a radio button is\\nnever found alone. Radio buttons are grouped together in a set that is used to\\ncontrol an option or feature of a program. Clicking on a radio button turns off\\nwhatever radio button was on at the time of the mouse click, and turns on the\\nnewly clicked radio button. Use a checkbox in a yes or no or true or false situation. Use radio buttons for a condition that offers multiple choices that are\\nmutually exclusive (since only one button can be on at any given time).\\nText field\\nThe BTextControl class is used to create a text field. A text field is a control\\nconsisting of a static string on the left and an editable text area on the right.\\nThe static text acts as a label that provides the user with information about\\nwhat is to be typed in the editable text area of the control. Typing text in the\\neditable text area of a control can have an immediate effect on the program,\\nbut it\\'s more common practice to wait until some other action takes place (like\\na click on a push button) before the program reads the user-entered text.\\nColor control\\nThe BColorControl class, shown in Chapter 5, creates color controls. A color\\ncontrol displays the 256 system colors, each in a small square. The user can\\nchoose a color by clicking on it. A program can, at any time, check to see\\nwhich color the user has currently selected, and perform some action based\\non that choice. Often the selected color is used in the next, or all subsequent,\\ndrawing operation the program performs.\\nFigure 6-1 shows four of the six types of controls available to you. In the upper\\nleft of the figure is a button. The control in the upper right is a text field. The\\nlower left of the figure shows a checkbox in both its on and off states, while the\\nlower right of the figure shows a radio button in both its states. A picture button\\ncan have any size and look you want, so it\\'s not shown. All the buttons are associated with labels that appear on or next to the controls themselves.\\nThe sixth control type, the color control based on the BColorControl class, isn\\'t\\nshown either--it was described in detail in Chapter 5 and will only be mentioned\\nin passing in this chapter.\\nA control can be in an enabled statewhere the user can interact with itor a\\ndisabled state. A disabled control will appear dim, and clicking on the control will\\nhave no effect. Figure 6-2 shows a button control in both its enabled state (leftmost in the figure) and its disabled state (rightmost in the figure). Also shown is\\nwhat an enabled button looks like when it is selected using the Tab key (middle\\nin the figure). A user can press the Tab key to cycle through controls, making each\\none in turn the current control. As shown in Figure 6-2, a button\\'s label will be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFigure 6-1. Examples of button, text field, checkbox, and radio button controls\\n\\nunderlined when it\\'s current. Once current, other key presses (typically the Return\\nand Enter key) affect that control.\\n\\nFigure 6-2. A button control that\\'s (from left to right) enabled, current, and disabled\\n\\nCreating a Control\\nA control is created from one of six Interface Kit classes--each of which is covered in detail in this chapter. Let us start by examining the BControl class from\\nwhich they are derived.\\nThe BControl class\\nThe BControl class is an abstract class derived from the BView and BInvoker\\nclasses. Control objects are created from BControl-derived classes, so all controls\\nare types of views.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to create controls that aren\\'t based on the BControl\\nclass. In fact, the Be API does that for the BListView and\\nBMenuItem classes. These are exceptions, though. You\\'ll do best by\\nbasing each of your application\\'s controls on one of the six\\nBControl-derived classes. Doing so means your controls will\\nbehave as expected by the user.\\n\\nBControl is an abstract class, so your project will create BControl-derived class\\nobjects rather than BControl objects. However, because the constructor of each\\nBControl-derived class invokes the BControl constructor, a study of the\\nBControl constructor is a worthwhile endeavor. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nBControl(BRect\\nconst char\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nFour of the six BControl constructor parameters match BView constructor parameters. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags arguments get passed to the\\nBView constructor by the BControl constructor. These parameters are discussed\\nin Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so here I\\'ll offer only a brief recap of\\ntheir purposes. The frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of\\nthe view. The name parameter establishes a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The resizingMode parameter is a mask that defines the behavior of the view should the size of the view\\'s parent view change. The flags\\nparameter is a mask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of notifications (such as update) the view is to be aware of.\\nThe remaining two BControl constructor parameters are specific to the control.\\nThe label parameter is a string that defines the text associated with it. For\\ninstance, for a button control, the label holds the words that appear on the button. The message parameter is a BMessage object that provides a means for the\\nsystem to recognize the control as a unique entity. When the control is selected by\\nthe user, it is this message that the system will send to the window that holds the\\ncontrol.\\nYour project won\\'t create BControl objects, so a sample call to the BControl\\nconstructor isn\\'t useful here. Instead, let\\'s look at the simplest type of BControlderived object: the BButton.\\nThe BButton class\\nCreating a new push button involves creating a new BButton object. The\\nBButton constructor parameters are an exact match of those used by the\\nBControl constructor:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor invokes the BControl constructor, passing all of its\\narguments to that routine. The BControl constructor uses the label argument to\\ninitialize the button\\'s label, and uses the message argument to assign a unique\\nmessage to the button. The BControl constructor then invokes the BView constructor, passing along the remaining four arguments it received from the BButton\\nconstructor. The BView constructor then sets up the button as a view. After the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nBControl and BView constructors have executed, the BButton constructor carries on with its creation of a button object by implementing button-specific tasks.\\nThis is, in essence, how the constructor for each of the BControl-derived classes\\nworks.\\nCreating a button\\nA button is created by defining the arguments that are passed to the BButton constructor and then invoking that constructor using new. To become functional, the\\nbutton must then be added to a window. That\\'s what\\'s taking place in this snippet:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nconst char* buttonName = \"OKButton\";\\nconst char* buttonLabel = \"OK\";\\nBButton\\n*buttonOK;\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonOK);\\n\\nIn the above code, the BRect variable buttonRect defines the size and location\\nof the button. This push button will be 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels high. The\\nbuttonName string gives the button the name \"OKButton.\" This is the name used\\nto locate and access the button by view name using the BView member function\\nFindView(). The name that actually appears on the button itself, \"OK,\" is defined\\nby the buttonLabel string. The message associated with the new button control\\nis a new BMessage object of type BUTTON_OK_MSG. I\\'ll explain the BMessage class\\nin a minute. Here it suffices to say that, as shown above, creating a new message\\ncan be as easy as defining a four-character string and passing this constant to the\\nBMessage constructor.\\nThe BButton constructor prototype lists six parameters, yet the above invocation\\nof that constructor passes only four arguments. The fifth and sixth parameters,\\nresizingMode and flags, offer default values that are used when these arguments are omitted. The default resizingMode value (B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP) creates a button that will remain a fixed distance from the left and\\ntop edges of the control\\'s parent view should the parent view be resized. The\\ndefault flags value (B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE) specifies that the control\\nneeds to be redrawn if altered, and that it can become the focus view in response\\nto keyboard actions.\\nAdding a control to a window means adding the control to a view. In the above\\nsnippet, it\\'s assumed that a view (perhaps an object of the application-defined\\nBView-derived MyDrawView class) has already been created.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nEnabling and disabling a control\\nWhen a control is created, it is initially enabled--the user can click on the control\\nto select it. If you want a control to be disabled, invoke the control\\'s\\nSetEnabled() member function. The following line of code disables the\\nbuttonOK button control that was created in the previous snippet:\\nbuttonOK->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nSetEnabled() can be invoked on a control at any time, but if the control is to\\nstart out disabled, call SetEnabled() before displaying the window the control\\nappears in. To again enable a control, call SetEnabled() with an argument of\\ntrue.\\nThis chapter\\'s CheckBoxNow project demonstrates the enabling and disabling of a\\nbutton. The technique in that example can be used on any type of control.\\nTurning a control on and off\\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are two-state controls--they can be on or off.\\nWhen a control of either of these two types is created, it is initially off. If you want\\nthe control on (to check a checkbox or fill in a radio button), invoke the\\nBControl member function SetValue(). Passing SetValue() the Be-defined\\nconstant B_CONTROL_ON sets the control to on. Turning a control on and off in\\nresponse to a user action in the control is the responsibility of the system--not\\nyour program. So after creating a control and setting it to the state you want, you\\nwill seldom need to call SetValue(). If you want your program to \"manually\"\\nturn a control off (as opposed to doing so in response to a user action), have the\\ncontrol invoke its SetValue() function with an argument of B_CONTROL_OFF.\\nA button is a one-state device, so turning a button on or off doesn\\'t make sense.\\nInstead, this snippet turns on a two-state control--a checkbox:\\nrequirePasswordCheckBox->SetValue(B_CONTROL_ON)\\n\\nCreating checkboxes hasn\\'t been covered yet, so you\\'ll want to look at the CheckBox example project later in this chapter to see the complete code for creating and\\nturning on a checkbox.\\n\\nTechnically, a button is also a two-state control. When it is not being\\nclicked, it\\'s off. When the control is being clicked (and before the\\nuser releases the mouse button), it\\'s on. This point is merely an\\naside, though, as it\\'s unlikely that your program will ever need to\\ncheck the state of a button in the way it will check the state of a\\ncheckbox or radio button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo check the current state of a control, invoke the BControl member function\\nValue(). This routine returns an int32 value that is either B_CONTROL_ON (which\\nis defined to be 1) or B_CONTROL_OFF (which is defined to be 0). This snippet\\nobtains the current state of a checkbox, then compares the value of the state to the\\nBe-defined constant B_CONTROL_ON:\\n\\ncontrolState;\\n\\ncontrolState = requirePasswordCheckBox->Value();\\nif (controlState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// password required, display password text field\\n\\nChanging a control\\'s label\\nBoth checkboxes and radio buttons have a label that appears to the right of the\\ncontrol. A text field has a label to the left of the control. The control\\'s label is set\\nwhen the control is created, but it can be changed on the fly.\\nThe BControl member function SetLabel() accepts a single argument: the text\\nthat is to be used in place of the control\\'s existing label. In this next snippet, a\\nbutton\\'s label is initially set to read \"Click,\" but is changed to the string \"Click\\nAgain\" at some point in the program\\'s execution:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonName = \"ClickButton\";\\n*buttonLabel = \"Click\";\\n*buttonClick;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_CLICK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonClick);\\n...\\n...\\nbuttonClick->SetLabel(\"Click Again\");\\n\\nThe labels of other types of controls are changed in the same manner. The last\\nexample project in this chapter, the TextField project, sets the label of a button to\\na string entered by the user.\\n\\nHandling a Control\\nBControl-derived classes take care of some of the work of handling a control. For\\ninstance, in order to properly update a control in response to a mouse button\\nclick, your program doesn\\'t have to keep track of the control\\'s current state, and it\\ndoesn\\'t have to include any code to set the control to the proper state (such as\\ndrawing or erasing the check mark in a checkbox). What action your program\\ntakes in response to a mouse button click is, however, your program\\'s responsibility. When the user clicks on a control, a message will be delivered to the affected\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nwindow. That message will be your program\\'s prompt to perform whatever action\\nis appropriate.\\nMessages and the BMessage class\\nWhen the Application Server delivers a system message to an application\\nwindow, that message arrives in the form of a BMessage object. Your code determines how to handle a system message simply by overriding a BView hook function (such as MouseDown()). Because the routing of a message from the Application Server to a window and then possibly to a view\\'s hook function is\\nautomatically handled for you, the fact that the message is a BMessage object may\\nnot have been important (or even known) to you. A control also makes use of a\\nBMessage object. However, in the case of a control, you need to know a little bit\\nabout working with BMessage objects.\\nThe BMessage class defines a message object as a container that holds information. Referring to the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book, you\\'ll find that this information consists of a name, some number of\\nbytes of data, and a type code. You\\'ll be pleased to find out that when using a\\nBMessage in conjunction with a control, a thorough knowledge of these details of\\nthe BMessage class isn\\'t generally necessary (complex applications aside). Instead,\\nall you need to know of this class is how to create a BMessage object. The snippet a few pages back that created a BButton object illustrated how that\\'s done:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\n// variable declarations here\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nThe only information you need to create a BMessage object is a four-character literal, as in the above definition of BUTTON_OK_MSG as `btmg\\'. This value, which\\nwill serve as the what field of the message, is actually a uint32. So you can\\ndefine the constant as an unsigned 32-bit integer, though most programmers find it\\neasier to remember a literal than the unsigned numeric equivalent. This value then\\nbecomes the argument to the BMessage constructor in the BButton constructor.\\nThis newly created message object won\\'t hold any other information.\\nThe BMessage class defines a single public data member named what. The what\\ndata member holds the four-character string that distinguishes the message from all\\nother message types--including system messages--the application will use. In the\\nprevious snippet, the constant btmg becomes the what data member of the\\nBMessage object created when invoking the BButton constructor.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nWhen the program refers to a system message by its Be-defined constant, such as\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED or B_KEY_DOWN, what\\'s really of interest is the what data\\nmember of the system message. The value of each Be-defined message constant is\\na four-character string composed of a combination of only uppercase characters\\nand, optionally, one or more underscore characters. Here\\'s how Be defines a few\\nof the system message constants:\\nenum {\\nB_ABOUT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n...\\n...\\n};\\n\\n= \\'_ABR\\',\\n\\n= \\'_QRQ\\',\\n\\n= \\'_MDN\\',\\n\\nBe intentionally uses the message constant value convention of uppercase-only\\ncharacters and underscores to make it obvious that a message is a system message. You can easily avoid duplicating a Be-defined message constant by simply\\nincluding one or more lowercase characters in the literal of your own applicationdefined message constants. And to make it obvious that a message isn\\'t a Bedefined one, don\\'t start the message constant name with \"B_\". In this book\\'s\\nexamples, I have chosen to use a fairly informative convention in choosing symbols for application-defined control messages: start with the control type, include a\\nword or words descriptive of what action the control results in, and end with\\n\"MSG\" for \"message.\" The value of each constant may hint at the message type\\n(for instance, `plSD\\' for \"play sound\"), but aside from avoiding all uppercase characters, the value is somewhat arbitrary. These two examples illustrate the convention I use:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_PLAY_SOUND_MSG\\nCALCULATE_VALUES\\n\\n\\'plSD\\'\\n\\'calc\\'\\n\\nMessages and the MessageReceived() member function\\nThe BWindow class is derived from the BLooper class, so a window is a type of\\nlooper--an object that runs a message loop that receives messages from the Application Server. The BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, so a window is also a handler--an object that can handle messages that are dispatched\\nfrom a message loop. A window can both receive messages and handle them.\\nFor the most part, system messages are handled automatically; for instance, when\\na B_ZOOM message is received, the operating system zooms the window. But you\\ncannot completely entrust the handling of an application-defined message to the\\nsystem.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nWhen a user selects a control, the Application Server delivers a message object\\nwith the appropriate what data member value to the affected BWindow object.\\nYou\\'ve just seen a snippet that created a BButton associated with a BMessage\\nobject. That BMessage had a what data member of `btmg\\'. If the user clicked on\\nthe button that results from this object, the Application Server would deliver such\\na message to the affected BWindow. It\\'s up to the window to include code that\\nwatches for, and responds to, this type of message. The BWindow class member\\nfunction MessageReceived() is used for this purpose.\\nWhen an application-defined message reaches a window, it looks for a\\nMessageReceived() function. This routine receives the message, examines the\\nmessage\\'s what data member, and responds depending on its value. The\\nBHandler class defines such a MessageReceived() function. The BHandlerderived class BWindow inherits this function and overrides it. The BWindow version includes a call to the base class BHandler version, thus augmenting what\\nBHandler offers. If the BWindow version of MessageReceived() can\\'t handle a\\nmessage, it passes it up to the BHandler version of this routine. Figure 6-3 shows\\nhow a message that can\\'t be handled by one version of MessageReceived() gets\\npassed up to the next version of this function.\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBHandler\\nversion\\nmessage\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow\\nversion\\nmessage\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nmessage\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow-derived\\nversion\\n\\nFigure 6-3. Message passed to parent class\\'s version of MessageReceived()\\n\\nHere is how the MessageReceived() looks in BWindow:\\nvoid BWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle B_KEY_DOWN and scripting-related system messages\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\ndefault:\\nBHandler::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nYour project\\'s windows won\\'t be based directly on the BWindow class. Instead,\\nwindows will be objects of a class you derive from BWindow. While such a\\nBWindow-derived class will inherit the BWindow version of MessageReceived(),\\nthat version of the function won\\'t suffice--it won\\'t know anything about the application-defined messages you\\'ve paired with the window\\'s controls. Your BWindowderived class should thus do what the BWindow class does: override the inherited\\nversion of MessageReceived() and, within the new implementation of this function, invoke the inherited version:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle application-defined messages\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhat messages your BWindow-derived class version of MessageReceived() looks\\nfor depends on the controls you\\'re adding to windows of that class type. If I add a\\nsingle button to windows of the MyHelloWindow class, and the button\\'s BButton\\nconstructor pairs a message object with a what constant of BUTTON_OK_MSG (as\\nshown in previous snippets), the MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived()\\nwould look like this:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\n// handle a click on the OK button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe particular code that appears under the control\\'s case label depends entirely\\non what action you want to occur in response to the control being clicked. For\\nsimplicity, assume that we want a click on the OK button to do nothing more than\\nsound a beep. The completed version of MessageReceived() looks like this:\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nButtons\\nThe BButton class is used to create a button--a labeled push button that is operated when the button is clicked. The previous sections used the BButton class\\nand button objects for its specific examples and in its code snippets. That section\\nprovided some background on creating and working with buttons, so the emphasis here will be on incorporating the button-related code in a project.\\n\\nCreating a Button\\nThe BButton constructor has six parameters, each of which was described in the\\n\"The BButton class\" section of this chapter:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor calls the BControl constructor, which in turn calls the\\nBView constructor. Together, these routines set up and initialize a BButton object.\\nAfter attaching the button to a window, the height of the button may automatically be adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the button\\'s label and\\nthe border of the button. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates result in\\na button that isn\\'t high enough, the BButton constructor will increase the button\\nheight by increasing the value of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact\\nheight of the button depends on the font in which the button label is displayed.\\nFor the example button creation code, assume that a window is keeping track of\\nBView and BButton objects in data members named fView and fButton, respectively, and that the button\\'s message type is defined by the constant BUTTON_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_MSG\\n\\n\\'bttn\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nprivate:\\nBView\\nBButton\\n\\n*fView;\\n*fButton;\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe code that creates a new button and adds it to the view fView might then look\\nlike this:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, \"MyButton\",\\n\"Click Me\", new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfView->AddChild(fButton);\\n\\nMaking a Button the Default Button\\nOne button in a window can be made the default button--a button that the user\\ncan select either by clicking or by pressing the Enter key. If a button is the default\\nbutton, it is given a wider border so that the user recognizes it as such a button.\\nTo make a button the default button, call the BButton member function\\nMakeDefault():\\nfButton->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nIf the window that holds the new default button already had a default button, the\\nold default button automatically loses its default status and becomes a \"normal\"\\nbutton. The system handles this task to ensure that a window has only one default\\nbutton.\\nWhile granting one button default status may be a user-friendly gesture, it might\\nalso not make sense in many cases. Thus, a window isn\\'t required to have a\\ndefault button.\\n\\nButton Example Project\\nThe TwoButtons project demonstrates how to create a window that holds two buttons. Looking at Figure 6-4, you can guess that a click on the leftmost button\\n(which is the default button) results in the playing of the system sound a single\\ntime, while a click on the other button produces the beep twice.\\nPreparing the window class for the buttons\\nA few additions to the code in the MyHelloWindow.h file are in order. First, a pair\\nof constants are defined to be used later when the buttons are created. The choice\\nof constant names and values is unimportant, provided that the names don\\'t begin\\nwith \"B_\" and that the constant values don\\'t consist of all uppercase characters.\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-4. The window that results from running the TwoButtons program\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s two buttons, a pair of data members of type\\nBButton are added to the already present data member of type MyDrawView. And\\nnow that the window will be receiving and responding to application-defined\\nmessages, the BWindow-inherited member function MessageReceived() needs to\\noverridden:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the buttons\\nThe buttons are created and added to the window in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, the constructor declares several variables that will be\\nused in the pair of calls to the BButton constructor and assigns them values:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*buttonBeep2Label = \"Beep Two\";\\n\\nIn the past, you\\'ve seen that I normally declare a variable within the routine that\\nuses it, just before its use. Here I\\'ve declared the six variables that are used as\\nBButton constructor arguments outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor--but\\nthey could just as well have been declared within the MyHelloWindow constructor. I opted to do things this way to get in the habit of grouping all of a window\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nlayout-defining code together. Grouping all the button boundary rectangles,\\nnames, and labels together makes it easier to lay out the buttons in relation to one\\nanother and to supply them with logical, related names and labels. This technique\\nis especially helpful when a window holds several controls.\\nThe buttons will be added to the fMyView view. Recall that this view is of the\\nBView-derived application-defined class MyDrawView and occupies the entire content area of a MyHelloWindow. In the MyHelloWindow constructor, the view is\\ncreated first, and then the buttons are created and added to the view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling button clicks\\nMessageReceived() always has a similar format. The Application Server passes\\nthis function a message as an argument. The message data member what holds\\nthe message type, so that data member should be examined in a switch statement, with the result compared to any application-defined message types the window is capable of handling. A window of type MyHelloWindow can handle a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_1_MSG and a BUTTON_BEEP_2_MSG. If a different type of message is\\nencountered, it gets passed on to the BWindow version of MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPicture Buttons\\nA picture button is a button that has a picture on its face rather than a text label.\\nThe picture button behaves like a standard push button--clicking and releasing\\nthe mouse button while over the picture button selects it.\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a picture button. Associated with one\\nBPictureButton object are two BPicture objects. One of the pictures acts as the\\nbutton when the button is in its normal state (that is, when the user isn\\'t clicking\\non it). The other picture acts as the button when the user clicks on the button.\\nYou\\'ll supply a BPictureButton object with the two pictures, and the system will\\nbe responsible for switching back and forth between the pictures in response to\\nthe user\\'s actions.\\n\\nCreating a Picture Button\\nA picture button is created by the BPictureButton constructor. As is the case for\\nother controls, this constructor invokes the BControl constructor, which in turn\\ninvokes the BView constructor:\\nBPictureButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*off,\\n*on,\\n*message,\\nbehavior = B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BPictureButton constructor has eight parameters, five of which you\\'re\\nalready familiar with. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags parameters\\nget passed to the BView constructor and are used in setting up the picture button\\nas a view. The message parameter is used by the BControl constructor to assign\\na message type to the picture button. The remaining three parameters, off, on,\\nand behavior, are specific to the creation of a picture button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nThe off and on parameters are BPicture objects that define the two pictures to\\nbe used to display the button. In Chapter 5, you saw how to create a BPicture\\nobject using the BPicture member functions BeginPicture() and\\nEndPicture(). Here I create a picture composed of a white circle within a black\\ncircle:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\n\\nA second BPicture object should then be created in the same way. These two\\nBPicture objects could then be used as the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBPictureButton constructor.\\n\\nFor more compelling graphic images, you can use bitmaps for button pictures. Once a bitmap exists, all that needs to appear between\\nthe BeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls is a call to the BView\\nmember function DrawBitMap(). Chapter 10, Files, discusses bitmaps.\\n\\nPicture buttons are actually more versatile than described in this section. Here the\\npicture button is treated as a one-state device--just as a standard push button is.\\nThe BPictureButton class can also be used, however, to create a picture button\\nthat is a two-state control. Setting the behavior parameter to the constant B_TWO_\\nSTATE_BUTTON tells the BPictureButton constructor to create a picture button\\nthat, when clicked on, toggles between the two pictures represented by the\\nBPicture parameters off and on. Clicking on such a picture button displays one\\npicture. Clicking on the button again displays the second picture. The displayed\\npicture indicates to the user the current state of the button. To see a good realworld use of a two-state picture button, run the BeIDE. Then choose Find from\\nthe Edit menu. In the lower-left area of the Find window you\\'ll find a button that\\nhas a picture of a small file icon on it. Click on the button and it will now have a\\npicture of two small file icons on it. This button is used to toggle between two\\nsearch options: search only the currently open, active file, and search all files\\npresent in the Find window list. Figure 6-5 shows both of this button\\'s two states.\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe two states of the same\\npicture button\\n\\nFigure 6-5. The Find window of the BeIDE provides an example of a picture button\\n\\nPicture Button Example Project\\nThe PictureButton project creates a program that displays a window that holds a\\nsingle picture button. Figure 6-6 shows this one window under two different conditions. The leftmost window in the figure shows the button in its normal state.\\nThe rightmost window shows that when the button is clicked it gets slightly\\nsmaller and its center is filled in.\\n\\nFigure 6-6. The window that results from running the PictureButton program\\n\\nThe picture button can include other pictures, which will be used if\\nthe program lets the button be disabled. Now that you know the\\nbasics of working with the BPictureButton class, the details of\\nenhancing your picture buttons will be a quick read in the\\nBPictureButton section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be\\nBook.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the picture button\\nThis chapter\\'s TwoButtons example project (presented in the \"Buttons\" section)\\nprovided a plan for adding a control, and support of that control, to a window.\\nHere\\'s how the window class header file (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this\\nproject) is set up for a new control:\\n\\n\\nDefine a constant to be used to represent an application-defined message type\\n\\n\\n\\nOverride MessageReceived() in the window class declaration\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a control data member in the window class declaration\\n\\nHere\\'s how the MyHelloWindow class is affected by the addition of a picture button to a window of this class type:\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fPicButtonBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nI\\'ve defined the PICTURE_BEEP_MSG constant to have a value of\\n\\'bep1\\'. Looking back at the TwoButtons example project, you\\'ll see\\nthat this is the same value I gave to that project\\'s BUTTON_BEEP_1_\\nMSG constant. If both controls were present in the same application,\\nI\\'d give one of these two constants a different value so that the\\nMessageReceived() function could distinguish between a click on\\nthe Beep One push button and a click on the picture button.\\n\\nCreating the picture button\\nThe process of creating a control can also be expressed in a number of steps. All\\nof the following affect the window source code file (the MyHelloWindow.cpp file\\nin this particular example):\\n\\n\\nDeclare and assign values to the variables to be used in the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate the control using new and the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach the control to the window by adding it to one of the window\\'s views\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nFollowing the above steps to add a picture button to the MyHelloWindow constructor results in a new version of this routine that looks like this:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n*buttonOnPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect offRect;\\nfMyView->FillRect(offRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(offRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect onRect;\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOnPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfPicButtonBeep = new BPictureButton(pictureBeep1Rect, pictureBeep1Name,\\nbuttonOffPict, buttonOnPict,\\nnew BMessage(PICTURE_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fPicButtonBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe two BPicture objects are defined using a few of the basic drawing techniques covered in Chapter 5. As you read the following, refer back to the picture\\nbutton in its off state (normal, or unclicked) and on state (being clicked) in\\nFigure 6-5.\\nThe off picture fills in a rectangle with the B_SOLID_LOW pattern (solid white) to\\nerase the on picture that might currently be displayed (if the user has just clicked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nthe picture button, the on picture will be serving as the picture button). Then a\\nrectangle is outlined to serve as the off button.\\nThe on picture erases the off picture (should it be currently drawn to the window\\nas the picture button) by drawing a white (B_SOLID_LOW) rectangle outline with\\nthe boundaries of the off picture rectangle. That rectangle is then inset two pixels\\nin each direction and a new rectangle is framed in black (B_SOLID_HIGH). The\\nrectangle is then inset two more pixels, and this new area is filled with black.\\nHandling a picture button click\\nTo handle a click on the picture button, MessageReceived() now looks for a\\nmessage of type PICTURE_BEEP_MSG. Should that message reach the window, the\\ncomputer sounds the system beep one time:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckboxes\\nThe BCheckBox class is used to add checkboxes to a window. A BCheckBox\\nobject includes both the checkbox itself and a label, or title, to the right of the\\nbox. A checkbox is a two-state control: in the on state, the checkbox has an \"X\" in\\nit; when off, it is empty. When a user clicks on a checkbox, its state is toggled. It\\'s\\nworthy of note that a checkbox label is considered a part of the checkbox control. That means that a user\\'s click on the checkbox itself or anywhere on the\\ncheckbox label will toggle the checkbox to its opposite state.\\nWhether a click results in a checkbox being turned on (checked) or off\\n(unchecked), a message is sent to the window that holds the checkbox. While a\\nprogram can immediately respond to a click on a checkbox, it is more typical for\\nthe program to wait until some other action takes place before responding. For\\ninstance, the setting of some program feature could be done via a checkbox.\\nClicking the checkbox wouldn\\'t, however, immediately change the setting. Instead,\\nwhen the user dismisses the window the checkbox resides in, the value of the\\ncheckbox can be queried and the setting of the program feature could be performed at that time.\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nCreating a Checkbox\\nThe BCheckBox constructor has six parameters:\\nBCheckBox(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BCheckBox parameters match those used in the BButton constructor--if you\\nknow how to create a button, you know how to create a checkbox. Adding to the\\nsimilarities is that after you attach the checkbox to a window, the control\\'s height\\nwill be automatically adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the control\\'s label. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates don\\'t produce a\\nrectangle with a height sufficient to display the checkbox label, the BCheckBox\\nconstructor will increase the checkbox boundary rectangle height by increasing the\\nvalue of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact height of the checkbox\\ndepends on the font in which the control\\'s label is displayed.\\nAs for other control types, you\\'ll define a message constant that is to be paired\\nwith the control. For instance:\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_MSG\\n\\n\\'ckbx\\'\\n\\nThen, optionally, add a data member of the control type to the class declaration of\\nthe window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBButton\\n*fCheckBox;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet is typical of the code you\\'ll write to create a new checkbox\\nand add that control to a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfCheckBox = new BCheckBox(checkBoxRect,\"MyCheckbox\"\\n\"Check Me\", new BMessage(CHECKBOX_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBox);\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Now) Example Project\\nClicking a checkbox may have an immediate effect on some aspect of the program, or it may not have an impact on the program until the user confirms the\\ncheckbox selection--usually by a click on a button. The former use of a check-\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nbox is demonstrated in the example project described here: CheckBoxNow. For an\\nexample of the other usage, a checkbox that has an effect after another action is\\ntaken, look over the next example, the CheckBoxLater project.\\nThe use of a checkbox to initiate an immediate action is often in practice when\\nsome area of the window the checkbox resides in is to be altered. For instance, if\\nsome controls in a window are to be rendered unusable in certain conditions, a\\ncheckbox can be used to disable (and then later enable) these controls. This is\\nhow the checkbox in the CheckBoxNow example works. The CheckBoxNow\\nproject creates a program with a window that holds two controls: a button and a\\ncheckbox. When the program launches, both controls are enabled, and the checkbox is unchecked--as shown in the top window in Figure 6-7. As expected, clicking on the Beep One button produces a single system beep. Clicking on the\\ncheckbox disables beeping by disabling the button. The bottom window in\\nFigure 6-7 shows how the program\\'s one window looks after clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox.\\n\\nFigure 6-7. The windows that result from running the CheckBoxNow program\\n\\nPreparing the Window class for the checkbox\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h file prepares for the window\\'s support of a button and a\\ncheckbox by defining a constant for each control\\'s message:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'stbp\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class now holds three data members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nBButton\\nBCheckBox\\n\\n*fCheckBoxSetBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the checkbox\\nI\\'ve declared and initialized the button and checkbox boundary rectangles near\\none another so that I could line them up--Figure 6-6 shows that the checkbox is\\njust to the right of the button and centered vertically with the button.\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*checkBoxSetBeepName = \"SetBeep\";\\n= \"Beep One\";\\n*checkBoxSetBeepLabel = \"Disable Beeping\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates both the button and checkbox:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfCheckBoxSetBeep = new BCheckBox(checkBoxSetBeepRect, checkBoxSetBeepName,\\ncheckBoxSetBeepLabel,\\nnew BMessage(CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBoxSetBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a checkbox click\\nWhen the checkbox is clicked, the system will toggle it to its opposite state and\\nthen send a message of the application-defined type CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG to\\nthe MyHelloWindow MessageReceived() routine. In response, this message\\'s\\ncase section obtains the new state of the checkbox and enables or disables the\\nBeep One button as appropriate. If the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, or\\non, the button is disabled by passing a value of false to the button\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nSetEnabled() routine. If the checkbox is unchecked, or off, a value of true is\\npassed to this same routine in order to enable the button:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, deactivate beep button\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, activate beep button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Later) Example Project\\nThe CheckBoxNow project responds immediately to a click on a checkbox. More\\noften, programs let users check or uncheck the checkboxes without any immediate effect. Thus, your program might reserve action until the choice is confirmed\\nby the user\\'s click on a button (such as OK, Done, or Accept). The CheckBoxLater project demonstrates this approach. Figure 6-7 shows that the CheckBoxLater program displays a window that looks similar to that displayed by the\\nCheckBoxNow program. The program differs in when the state of the checkbox is\\nqueried by the program. In the CheckBoxLater program, clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox any number of times has no immediate effect on the Beep One\\nbutton (in Figure 6-8, you see that the checkbox is checked, yet the button isn\\'t\\ndisabled). It\\'s only when the user clicks the Beep One button that the program\\nchecks to see if the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked. If it isn\\'t checked, the\\nbutton click plays the system beep. If it is checked, the button can still be clicked,\\nbut no sound will be played.\\nThe only changes that were made to the CheckBoxNow code to turn it into the\\ncode for the CheckBoxLater project are in the MessageReceived() function.\\nHere\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-8. The window that results from running the CheckBoxLater program\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, meaning DON\\'T beep\\n;\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, meaning DO beep\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\n// Here we don\\'t do anything. Instead, we wait until the user\\n// performs some other action before checking the value of the\\n// checkbox break;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIn MessageReceived(), the body of the CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case section\\nperforms no action--a message of this type is now essentially ignored. The program would run the same even if this case section was removed, but I\\'ve left the\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case label in the switch so that it\\'s evident that\\nMessageReceived() is still the recipient of such messages.\\n\\nRadio Buttons\\nA radio button is similar to a checkbox in that it is a two-state control. Unlike a\\ncheckbox, though, a radio button always appears grouped with at least one other\\ncontrol of its kind.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFor any given radio button group, no more than one radio button can be on at\\nany time. When the user clicks on one button in a group, the button that was on\\nat the time of the click is turned off and the newly clicked button is turned on. A\\nradio button group is responsible for updating the state of its buttons--your code\\nwon\\'t need to turn them on and off.\\n\\nCreating a Radio Button\\nThe BRadioButton constructor has the same six parameters described back in this\\nchapter\\'s \"The BControl class\" section:\\nBRadioButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nLike other types of controls, a radio button\\'s height will be adjusted if the height\\nspecified in the frame rectangle isn\\'t enough to accommodate the font being used\\nto display the radio button\\'s label.\\nBefore creating a new radio button, define a constant to be used as the control\\'s\\nmessage type. Here\\'s an example from a project that has two radio buttons in a\\nwindow:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess to a radio button is easiest if a data member of the control type is added to\\nthe class declaration of the window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet shows the creation of two radio buttons, each of which is\\nadded to the same view:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\"One\", new BMessage(RADIO_1_MSG));\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\n\"Two\", new BMessage(RADIO_2_MSG));\\n\\nBy adding radio buttons to the same view, you designate that the buttons be considered a part of a radio button group. The simple act of placing a number of buttons in the same view is enough to have these buttons act in unison. A click on\\none radio button turns that button on, but not until that button turns off all other\\nradio buttons in the same view.\\nA single window can have any number of radio button groups, or sets. For\\ninstance, a window might have one group of three buttons that provides the user\\nwith the option of displaying graphic images in monochrome, grayscale, or color.\\nThis same window could also have a radio button group that provides the user\\nwith a choice of four filters to apply to the image. In such a scenario, the window\\nwould need to include a minimum of two views--one for the group of three\\ncolor-level radio buttons and another for the group of four filter radio buttons.\\n\\nRadio Buttons Example Project\\nThe RadioButtonGroup project demonstrates how to create a group of radio buttons. As shown in Figure 6-9, the RadioButtonGroup program\\'s window includes a\\ngroup of three radio buttons that allow the user to alter the behavior of the Beep\\npush button.\\n\\nFigure 6-9. The window that results from running the RadioButtonGroup program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the radio buttons\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file includes four control message constants--one\\nper control. The push button constant has been given the value \\'bEEp\\' just to\\nillustrate that an application-defined message constant can include uppercase characters (to avoid conflicting with Be-defined control message constants, it just\\nshouldn\\'t consist of all uppercase characters).\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\'bEEp\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nThis project\\'s version of the MyHelloWindow class includes six data members: one\\nto keep track of the window\\'s view, one to keep track of each of the window\\'s\\nfour controls, and one to keep track of the number of beeps to play when the\\npush button is clicked:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLaying out the radio buttons\\nA number of radio buttons are defined as a group when they all reside in the same\\nview. A MyHelloWindow object includes a view (MyDrawView) that occupies its\\nentire content area--so I could add the three radio buttons to this view and have\\nthem automatically become a radio button group. That, however, isn\\'t what I\\'m\\nabout to do. Instead, I\\'ll create a new view and add it to the existing view. If at a\\nlater time I want to add a second group of radio buttons (to control some other,\\nunrelated, option) to the window, the buttons that will comprise that group will\\nneed to be in a new view--otherwise they\\'ll just be absorbed into the existing\\nradio button group. By creating a new view that exists just for one group of radio\\nbuttons, I\\'m getting in the habit of setting up a radio button group as an isolated\\nentity.\\nPlacing a radio button group in its own new view also proves beneficial if it\\nbecomes necessary to make a change to the layout of all of the group\\'s radio buttons. For instance, if I want to relocate all of the buttons in a group to another\\narea of the window, I just redefine the group\\'s view rectangle rather than redefining each of the individual radio button boundary rectangles. When the view\\nmoves, so do the radio buttons in it. Or, consider that I may, for aesthetic reasons, want to outline the area that holds the radio buttons. I can easily do so by\\nframing the radio button group view.\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe following variable declarations appear near the top of the MyHelloWindow.\\ncpp file. Note that the boundary rectangle for each of the three radio buttons has a\\nleft coordinate of 10.0, yet the radio buttons are certainly more than 10 pixels in\\nfrom the left side of the window.\\nKeep in mind that after being created, the radio buttons will be added to a new\\nBView that is positioned in the window based on the radioGroupRect rectangle.\\nThus, the coordinate values of the radio button rectangles are relative to the new\\nBView. Figure 6-10 clarifies my point by showing where the radio group view will\\nbe placed in the window. In that figure, the values 125 and 50 come from the left\\nand top values in the radioGroupRect rectangle declared here:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\n*radioBeep1Label = \"One Beep\";\\n*radioBeep2Label = \"Two Beeps\";\\n*radioBeep3Label = \"Three Beeps\";\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-10. A group of radio buttons can reside in their own view\\n\\nCreating the radio buttons\\nThe three radio buttons are created, as expected, in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, a generic view (a view of the Be class BView) to which the\\nradio buttons will be added is created and added to the view of type MyDrawView.\\nBy default, each new radio button is turned off. A group of radio buttons must\\nalways have one button on, so after the three radio buttons are created, one of\\nthem (arbitrarily, the One Beep button) is turned on by calling the button\\'s\\nSetValue() member function. The data member fNumBeeps is then initialized to\\na value that matches the number of beeps indicated by the turned-on radio button:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBView\\n\\n*radioGroupView;\\n\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\",\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a radio button click\\nWhen a radio button is clicked, a message of the appropriate application-defined\\ntype reaches the window\\'s MessageReceived() function. The clicking of a radio\\nbutton, like the clicking of a checkbox, typically doesn\\'t cause an immediate\\naction to occur. Such is the case in this example. MessageReceived() handles\\nthe button click by simply setting the MyHelloWindow data member fNumBeeps to\\nthe value indicated by the clicked-on radio button. When the user eventually clicks\\non the Beep push button, beep() is invoked the appropriate number of times:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 3;\\nbreak;\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nfor (i = 1; i <= fNumBeeps; i++) {\\nbeep();\\nif (i != fNumBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nView Hierarchy and Controls\\nChapter 4 introduced the concept of the window view hierarchy--the organization of views within a window. In this chapter\\'s most recent example you\\'ve just\\nseen a window that included a number of views (keeping in mind that a control is\\na type of view). Now that you\\'ve encountered the first example that includes several views, this a good time to revisit the topic of the view hierarchy in order to fill\\nin some of the details. Figure 6-11 shows the view hierarchy for a window--an\\nobject of the MyHelloWindow class--from the RadioButtonGroup program.\\nAdding views to the hierarchy\\nA window\\'s top view is always a \"built-in\" part of the window--you don\\'t explicitly add the top view as you add other views. The BView-derived fMyView view\\nlies directly below the top view, telling you that this view has been added to the\\nwindow. The BButton fButtonBeep1 view and the BView radioGroupView lie\\ndirectly below the fMyView view, so you know that each has been added to\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTop View\\n\\nfmyView\\n\\n\\nradioGroupView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-11. The view hierarchy for the RadioButtonGroup window\\n\\nfMyView. Finally, the three BRadioButton views are beneath radioGroupView,\\ntelling you that these three views have been added to radioGroupView. You can\\nconfirm this by looking at the six AddChild() calls in the MyHelloWindow constructor--they indicate which parent view each view was added to:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n...\\n...\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAccessing views\\nThe names of the views in Figure 6-12 tell you how each view is referenced.\\nYou don\\'t draw to the top view--it merely serves as a container for organizing\\nother views. To reference this view (as when adding a view to the window), reference the window itself. In the window\\'s constructor, just call the desired BWindow\\nmember function, as in:\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFrom outside a window member function, use the fMyWindow data member from\\nthe MyHelloApplication object. If the fMyView view was to be added in the\\nBApplication constructor after the window was created, the call to AddChild()\\nwould look like this:\\nfMyWindow->AddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe Be naming convention states that the name of a class data member should\\nstart with a lowercase \"f\" character. In Figure 6-11 you see that five of the six\\nviews below the top view are referenced by data members. To work with any one\\nof these views, use the data member that references it. For instance, to invoke the\\nBView member function FillRect() to fill a rectangle in the window\\'s fMyView\\nview, just call the routine like this:\\nfMyView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nI haven\\'t kept a data member reference in the MyHelloWindow class to the BView\\nthat groups the three radio buttons. If it became necessary to reference this view,\\nyou could call the BView member function FindView() to locate the view object\\nand return a reference to it. Recall that when a view is created, you give it a name.\\nFor example, the radio group view was given the name \"RadioView\":\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n\\nYou can find the view at any time by calling FindView() from the parent view.\\nFor instance, to fill a rectangle in the radio group view, call FindView() from that\\nview\\'s parent view, fMyView:\\nBView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\naView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nKeep in mind that there are always two, and may be three, references, associated with one view. When a view is created, the view\\nobject is returned to the program and referenced by a variable (such\\nas radioGroupView in the preceding example). When invoking the\\nBView (or BView-derived) class constructor, a name for the view is\\nsupplied in quotes (as in \"RadioView\" in the preceding example).\\nFinally, some views have a label--a name that is displayed on the\\nview itself (as in a control such as a BButton--the button displays a\\nname such as OK or Beep).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nView Updating\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, the MyHelloWindow constructor creates a view\\nreferenced by the MyHelloWindow data member fMyView and a view referenced\\nby the local BView variable radioGroupView. This one MyHelloWindow constructor shows two ways of working with views, so it will be worth our while to again\\nsidetrack from the discussion of controls in order to gain a better understanding of\\nthe very important topic of views.\\nBView-derived classes and the generic BView class\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, and several projects preceding it, I\\'ve opted to\\nfill the content area of a window with a view of the application-defined BViewderived class MyDrawView. One of the chief reasons for defining such a class is to\\nlet the system become responsible for updating a view. This is accomplished by\\nhaving my own class override the BView member function Draw().\\nA second way to work with a view is to not define a view class, but instead simply create a generic BView object within an application-derived routine. That\\'s\\nwhat the RadioButtonGroup project does in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\n\\nAfter you attach the new view to an existing view, drawing can take place in the\\nnew view. For instance, if in addition to beeping, you want the program to draw a\\nborder around the three radio buttons in response to a click on the window\\'s one\\npush button, add the following code under the BUTTON_BEEP_MSG case label in\\nthe MessageReceived() function:\\nBView\\nBRect\\n\\n*radioView;\\nradioFrame;\\n\\nradioView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\nradioFrame = radioView->Bounds();\\nradioView->StrokeRect(radioFrame);\\n\\nSuperficially, this approach of creating a generic BView and then drawing in it is\\nsimpler than defining a BView-derived class and then implementing a Draw()\\nfunction for that class. But in taking this easier approach, you lose the benefit of\\nhaving the system take responsibility for updating the view. Consider the above\\nsnippet. That code will nicely frame the three radio buttons. But if the window\\nthat holds the buttons ever needs updating (and if the user is allowed to move the\\nwindow, of course at some point it will), the frame that surrounds the buttons\\nwon\\'t be redrawn. The system will indeed invoke a Draw() function for\\nradioGroupView, but it will be the empty BView version of Draw().\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nImplementing a BView-derived class in the RadioButtonGroup project\\nWhat if I do want my RadioButtonGroup program to frame the radio buttons, and\\nto do so in a way that automatically updates the frame as needed? Instead of placing the radio buttons in a generic BView object, I can define a new BView-derived\\nclass just for this purpose:\\nclass MyRadioView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyRadioView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyRadioView constructor can be empty--just as the MyDrawView constructor\\nis:\\nMyRadioView::MyRadioView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyRadioView version of the Draw() function is quite simple as well:\\nvoid MyRadioView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nWhile I could keep track of an instance of the MyRadioView class by calling the\\nparent view\\'s FindView() function as needed, I\\'d opt for the method of storing a\\nreference to the view in the window that will hold the view. Here I\\'ve added such\\na reference to the six existing data members in the MyHelloWindow class of the\\nRadioButtonGroup project:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nMyRadioView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n*fMyRadioView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create a MyRadioView object, I replace the generic BView creation code in the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor with the following:\\nfMyRadioView = new MyRadioView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\");\\nfMyView->AddChild(fMyRadioView);\\n\\nNow, when a radio button is created, I add it to the MyRadioView object\\nfMyRadioView, like this:\\n\\nThanks to the Draw() function of the MyRadioView class, the new radio button\\ngroup will have a border drawn around it, exactly as was shown back in\\nFigure 6-10. Better yet, obscuring the window and then bringing it back to the\\nforefront doesn\\'t cause the border to disappear--the update message that the\\nApplication Server sends to the MyHelloWindow window results in the calling of\\nthe Draw() function of each \"out-of-date\" view in the window.\\nIf you want to see all of the code for this new version of the RadioButtonGroup\\nprogram, you\\'ll find it in the RadioButtonGroupFrame project.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve followed this discussion, you should be able to quickly\\nanswer the following question: in the original RadioButtonGroup\\nproject, why didn\\'t I create a new BView-derived class like the\\nMyRadioView class and use an object of that type to hold the radio\\nbuttons? Answer: because I use the radio button view only as a\\nmeans to group the radio buttons together--I don\\'t draw to the\\nview. The simple approach of creating a BView on the fly works for\\nthat purpose.\\n\\nText Fields\\nThe BTextControl class is used to add a text field to a window. A text field consists of both a static, uneditable label and an editable field that allows the user to\\nenter a single line of text. The label appears to the left of the editable field, and is\\ngenerally used to provide the user with an idea of what to enter in the editable\\nfield (\"Enter your age in years:\" is an example).\\nA text field is often handled like a checkbox or radio button: no immediate action\\nis taken by the program in response to the user\\'s action. Typically, the program\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nacquires the text in the text field only when a button labeled OK, Accept, Save, or\\nsomething similar is clicked on.\\nIf your program needs to get or set the editable text of a text field as soon as the\\nuser has finished typing, the BTextControl accommodates you. Like other controls, a text field issues a message that will be received by the\\nMessageReceived() function of the control\\'s window. Such a message is sent\\nwhen the control determines that the user has finished entering text in the editable field, as indicated by a press of the Enter, Return, or Tab key or a mouse button click in the editable field of a different text field control. In all of these\\ninstances, the text that was previously in the editable field must have been modified in order for the control to send the message. If the user, say, clicks in an editable field of a text field, then presses the Enter key, no message will be sent.\\n\\nCreating a Text Field\\nThe BTextControl constructor has six parameters common to all controls, along\\nwith a text parameter that specifies a string that is to initially appear in the editable field of the text field control:\\nBTextControl(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*text,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nPassing a string in the text parameter of the BTextControl constructor is useful\\nif you want to alert the user that a default string or value is to be used in the event\\nthat the user doesn\\'t enter a string or value. If a value of NULL is passed as the\\ntext parameter, no text initially appears in the editable field.\\nAs with all control types, you must define a unique message constant that will be\\npaired with the control. To assist in keeping track of the text field control, you can\\noptionally include a data member in the window class in which the control is to\\nreside:\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_FIELD_MSG\\n\\n\\'txtf\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBTextControl *fTextField;\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create the control, pass the BTextControl constructor a boundary rectangle,\\nname, static text label, initial editable text, and a new BMessage object. Then add\\nthe new text field to the view the control will reside in:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Number of dependents:\", \"0\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nGetting and Setting the Text\\nAfter creating a text field control, your program can obtain or set the editable field\\ntext at any time. To obtain the text currently in the text field, invoke the\\nBTextControl member function Text(). Here, the text in a control is returned to\\nthe program and saved to a string named textFieldText:\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n\\nThe text that appears in the editable field of the control is initially set in the\\nBTextControl constructor, and is then edited by the user. The contents of the\\neditable field can also be set at any time by your program by invoking the\\nBTextControl member function SetText(). This routine overwrites the current\\ncontents of the editable field with the string that was passed to SetText(). Here\\nthe current contents of a control\\'s editable field are obtained and checked for\\nvalidity. If the user-entered string isn\\'t consistent with what\\'s expected, the string\\n\"Invalid Entry\" is written in place of the incorrect text the user entered:\\nchar\\nbool\\n\\n*textFieldText;\\ntextValid;\\n\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n...\\n// check for validity of user-entered text that\\'s now held in textFieldText\\n...\\nif (!textValid)\\nfTextField->SetText(\"Invalid Entry\");\\n\\nReproportioning the Static Text and Editable\\nText Areas\\nThe label parameter specifies the static text that is to appear to the left of the\\neditable field. If NULL is passed here, all of the control\\'s boundary rectangle (as\\ndefined by the frame parameter) is devoted to the text field. Any label string\\nother than NULL tells the constructor to devote half the width of the frame\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nrectangle to the static text label and the other half of this rectangle to the editable\\ntext area. Consider this snippet:\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Name:\", \"George Washington Carver\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nIn this code, a text field control with a width of 200 pixels is created. By default,\\nthe static text field and the editable text field of the control each have a width that\\nis one-half of the control\\'s boundary rectangle, or 100 pixels. The result is shown\\nin the top window in Figure 6-12. Because the label is a short string, and because\\nthe value that might be entered in the editable text field may be a long string, it\\nwould make sense and be more aesthetically pleasing to change the proportions\\nof the two text areas. Instead of devoting 100 pixels to the static text label\\n\"Name:\", it would be better to give that text just, say, 35 pixels of the 200 pixels\\nthat make up the control\\'s width. Such reproportioning is possible using the\\nBTextControl member function SetDivider().\\n\\nFigure 6-12. The two areas of a text field control can be proportioned in different ways\\n\\nWhen passed a floating-point value, SetDivider() re-establishes the dividing\\npoint between the two text areas of a text field control. SetDivider() uses the\\nBTextControl object\\'s local coordinate system (meaning that the left edge of the\\ntext edit control has a value of 0.0, regardless of where the control is positioned in\\na window). The following addition to the above snippet changes the ratio to 35\\npixels for the static text field and 165 pixels for the editable text field. The bottom\\nwindow in Figure 6-12 shows the result. Notice that the placement and overall\\nwidth of the control are unaffected by the call to SetDivider().\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nfloat\\n\\nxCoordinate = 35.0;\\n\\nfTextField->SetDivider(xCoordinate);\\n\\nText Field Example Project\\nThe TextField project demonstrates how to include a text field in a window, obtain\\nthat control\\'s user-entered string, and make use of that string elsewhere. When the\\nuser clicks the window\\'s button, the program gets the string from the text field and\\nuses that string as the new label for the push button. Figure 6-13 shows the program\\'s window after the button has been clicked.\\n\\nFigure 6-13. The window that results from running the TextField program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the text field\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file is edited to include a control message constant\\nfor the window\\'s two controls.\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG\\n\\n\\'newT\\'\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s views, the MyHelloWindow class now holds three\\ndata members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBTextControl\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNewTitle;\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nCreating the text field\\nThe text field and button information are defined together just before the implementation of the MyHelloWindow constructor. The push button label will initially\\nbe \"Beep One\" and the text that will appear initially in the editable field of the text\\nfield control is the string \"Beep Me!\":\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*textNewTitleName = \"TextTitle\";\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*textNewTitleLabel = \"Enter New Button Name:\";\\n*textNewTitleText = \"Beep Me!\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates the window\\'s main view, then creates\\nand adds the button control and text field control to that view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfTextNewTitle = new BTextControl(textNewTitleRect, textNewTitleName,\\ntextNewTitleLabel, textNewTitleText,\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextNewTitle);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a text field entry and a button click\\nA program can make use of a text field control in two ways. First, a window can\\nobtain the user-entered text from a text field control at any time--without regard\\nfor whether the text field has issued a message. Second, a window can await a\\nmessage sent by the text field and then respond. The MessageReceived() function demonstrates both these options.\\nWhen the window\\'s push button is clicked, the window receives a message from\\nthe button. At that time, the editable text of the text field control is retrieved and\\nused in a call to the button\\'s SetLabel() function. While the retrieving of the text\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nfield control\\'s editable text takes place in response to a message, that message is\\none issued by the push button--not the text field control.\\nWhen the user clicks in the text field, that control becomes the focus view. Recall\\nfrom Chapter 4 that a window can have only one focus view, and that view\\nbecomes the recipient of keystrokes. Once a text field is the focus view (as indicated by the editable text field being highlighted and the I-beam appearing in it),\\nand once that control\\'s editable text has been altered in any way, the control is\\ncapable of sending a message. That happens when the user presses the Return,\\nEnter, or Tab key. In response to a message sent by the text field control,\\nMessageReceived() resets the push button\\'s label to its initial title of \"Beep One\"\\n(as defined by the buttonBeep1Label constant):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNewTitle->Text();\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMultiple Control Example Project\\nThe numerous example projects in this chapter demonstrated how to incorporate\\none, or perhaps two, types of controls in a window. Your real-world program\\nmight very well include numerous controls. ControlDemo is such a program--its\\none window holds the six controls shown in Figure 6-14.\\nTo use ControlDemo, enter a number in the range of 1 to 9 in the text field control, click a radio button control to choose one of three drawing colors, then click\\nthe Draw button. The ControlDemo program responds by drawing colored, overlapping circles. The number of circles drawn is determined by the value entered in\\nthe text field. Before drawing the circles, ControlDemo erases the drawing area--\\nso you can try as many combinations of circles and colors as you want. You can\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-14. The window that results from running the ControlDemo program\\n\\nalso click the Disable colors checkbox to disable the radio buttons and force drawing to take place in the last selected color.\\n\\nPreparing the Window Class for the Controls\\nThe program\\'s window holds six controls, so you can expect to see six application-defined message constants in the MyHelloWindow.h file:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_DRAW_MSG\\nRADIO_RED_MSG\\nRADIO_GREEN_MSG\\nRADIO_BLACK_MSG\\nTEXT_NUM_CIRCLES_MSG\\nCHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG\\n\\n\\'draw\\'\\n\\'rred\\'\\n\\'rgrn\\'\\n\\'rblk\\'\\n\\'crcl\\'\\n\\'setc\\'\\n\\nEach control is kept track of by a data member in the MyHelloWindow class.\\nThere\\'s also the familiar data member that exists to keep track of the window\\'s\\nmain view:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBTextControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBButton\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNumCircles;\\n*fCheckBoxSetColor;\\n*fRadioRed;\\n*fRadioGreen;\\n*fRadioBlack;\\n*fButtonDraw;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nCreating the Controls\\nAll of the variables that are to be used as arguments to the control constructors are\\ndeclared together in MyHelloWindow.cpp. Each of the controls is then created in\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor. There are no surprises here--just use new with\\nthe appropriate control constructor and assign the resulting object to the proper\\nMyHelloWindow data member.\\nYou should be quite familiar with this process by now. To see the complete\\nMyHelloWindow constructor listing, refer to MyHelloWindow.cpp.\\n\\nHandling the Messages\\nAll application-defined control messages are handled in the body of the switch\\nstatement in MessageReceived(). The checkbox message is handled by first\\nchecking the control\\'s value, then disabling or enabling the three radio buttons as\\nappropriate:\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetColor->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON) {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(false);\\n}\\nelse {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(true);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nEach of the radio buttons does nothing more than set the high color to an RGB\\ncolor that matches the button\\'s label:\\ncase RADIO_RED_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_GREEN_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_BLACK_MSG:\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nClicking the Draw button results in a number of colored circles being drawn. Here\\nthe text field value is obtained to see how many circles to draw, and the high\\ncolor is used in the drawing of those circles. Before drawing the circles, any old\\ndrawing is erased by whiting out an area of the window that is at least as big as\\nthe drawing area:\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nnumCircles;\\ni;\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst char *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNumCircles->Text();\\nnumCircles = (int32)textFieldText[0] - 48;\\nif ((numCircles < 1) || (numCircles > 9))\\nnumCircles = 5;\\nfMyView->FillRect(areaRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfor (i=1; i<=numCircles; i++) {\\nfMyView->StrokeEllipse(circleRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe text field message is completely ignored. The program obtains the editable\\ntext when the user clicks the Draw button. As written, the program checks the text\\nfield input to see if the user entered a numeric character in the range of 1 to 9. If\\nany other value (or character or string) has been entered, the program arbitrarily\\nsets the number of circles to draw to five. This is a less-than-perfect way of doing\\nthings in that it allows the user to enter an invalid value. One way to improve the\\nprogram would be to have the program react to a text field control message. That\\ntype of message is delivered to MessageReceived() when the user ends a typing session (that is, when the user clicks elsewhere, or presses the Enter, Return,\\nor Tab key). MessageReceived() could then check the user-entered value and, if\\ninvalid, set the editable text area to a valid value (and, perhaps, post a window\\nthat informs the user what has taken place).\\n\\nModifying the ControlDemo Project\\nWhat the program draws isn\\'t important to the demonstration of how to include a\\nnumber of controls in a window. With the graphics information found in Chapter 4\\nyou should be able to modify ControlDemo so that it draws something far more\\ninteresting. Begin by enlarging the window so that you have some working room.\\nIn the MyHelloWorld.cpp file, change the size of the BRect passed to the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nMyHelloWindow constructor. Here I\\'m setting the window to have a width of 500\\npixels and a height of 300 pixels:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nLimiting drawing to only three colors isn\\'t a very user-friendly thing to do, so your\\nnext change might be to include a BColorControl object that lets the user\\nchoose any of the 256 system colors. The details of working with a color control\\nwere covered back in Chapter 5. Recall that you can easily support this type of\\ncontrol by first adding a BColorControl data member to the MyHelloWindow\\nclass:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nBColorControl\\n*fColorControl;\\n};\\n\\nThen, in the MyHelloWindow constructor, create the control and add it to the window. You\\'ll need to determine the appropriate coordinates for the BPoint and a\\nsuitable Be-defined constant for the color_control_layout in order to position\\nthe color control in the window you\\'re designing:\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_4x64;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n\\nFinally, when it comes time to draw, check to see which color the user has\\nselected from the color control. You can do that when the user clicks the Draw\\nbutton:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n// now load up this section with plenty of graphics-drawing code\\nbreak;\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nNow, review Chapter 4 to come up some ideas for drawing some really interesting graphics. Then add them under the BUTTON_DRAW_MSG case label in\\nMessageReceived()!\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Introduction to\\nControls\\n Buttons\\n Picture Buttons\\n Checkboxes\\n Radio Buttons\\n Text Fields\\n Multiple Control\\nExample Project\\n\\n6.\\n\\nControls and\\nMessages\\n\\nA control is a graphic image that resides in a window and acts as a device that\\naccepts user input. The BeOS API includes a set of classes that make it easy to add\\ncertain predefined controls to a program. These standard controls include the button, checkbox, radio button, text field, and color control. There\\'s also a Be-defined\\nclass that allows you to turn any picture into a control. That allows you to create\\ncontrols that have the look of real-world devices such as switches and dials.\\nChapter 5, Drawing, described the color control and the BColorControl class\\nused to create such controls. This chapter discusses other control types and the\\nclasses used to create each. Also discussed is the BControl class, the class from\\nwhich all other control classes are derived.\\nWhen the user clicks on a control, the system responds by sending a message to\\nthe window that holds the control. This message indicates exactly which control\\nhas been clicked. The message is received by the window\\'s MessageReceived()\\nhook function, where it is handled. Since the BWindow version of\\nMessageReceived() won\\'t know how to go about responding to messages that\\noriginate from your controls, you\\'ll override this routine. Your application then\\ngains control of how such messages are handled, and can include any code necessary to carry out the task you want the control to perform. This chapter includes\\nexamples that demonstrate how to create controls and how to override\\nMessageReceived() such that the function handles mouse clicks on controls of\\nany of the standard types.\\n\\nIntroduction to Controls\\nWhen a BWindow object receives a message, it either handles the message itself or\\nlets one of its views handle it. To handle a message, the window invokes a\\nBWindow hook function. For example, a B_ZOOM message delivered to a window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nresults in that window invoking the BWindow hook function Zoom() to shrink or\\nenlarge the window. To allocate the handling of a message to one of its views, the\\nwindow passes the message to the affected view, and the view then invokes the\\nappropriate BView hook function. For example, a B_MOUSE_DOWN message results\\nin the affected view invoking the BView hook function MouseDown().\\nBesides being the recipient of system messages, a window is also capable of\\nreceiving application-defined messages. This lets you implement controls in your\\napplication\\'s windows. When you create a control (such as a button object from\\nthe BButton class), define a unique message type that becomes associated with\\nthat one control. Also, add the control to a window. When the user operates the\\ncontrol (typically by clicking on it, as for a button), the system passes the application-defined message to the window. How the window handles the message is\\ndetermined by the code you include in the BWindow member function\\nMessageReceived().\\n\\nControl Types\\nYou can include a number of different types of controls in your windows. Each\\ncontrol is created from a class derived from the abstract class BControl. The\\nBControl class provides the basic features common to all controls, and the\\nBControl-derived classes add capabilities unique to each control type. In this\\nchapter, you\\'ll read about the following control types:\\nButton\\nThe BButton class is used to create a standard button, sometimes referred to\\nas a push button. Clicking on a button results in some immediate action taking place.\\nPicture button\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a button that can have any size,\\nshape, and look to it. While picture buttons can have an infinite variety of\\nlooks, they act in the same manner as a push button--a mouse click results in\\nan action taking place.\\nCheckbox\\nThe BCheckBox class creates a checkbox. A checkbox has two states: on and\\noff. Clicking a checkbox always toggles the control to its opposite state or\\nvalue. Clicking on a checkbox usually doesn\\'t immediately impact the program. Instead, a program typically waits until some other action takes place\\n(such as the click of a certain push button) before gathering the current state\\nof the checkbox. At that time, some program setting or feature is adjusted\\nbased on the value in the checkbox.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nRadio button\\nThe BRadioButton class is used to create a radio button. Like a checkbox, a\\nradio button has two states: on and off. Unlike a checkbox, a radio button is\\nnever found alone. Radio buttons are grouped together in a set that is used to\\ncontrol an option or feature of a program. Clicking on a radio button turns off\\nwhatever radio button was on at the time of the mouse click, and turns on the\\nnewly clicked radio button. Use a checkbox in a yes or no or true or false situation. Use radio buttons for a condition that offers multiple choices that are\\nmutually exclusive (since only one button can be on at any given time).\\nText field\\nThe BTextControl class is used to create a text field. A text field is a control\\nconsisting of a static string on the left and an editable text area on the right.\\nThe static text acts as a label that provides the user with information about\\nwhat is to be typed in the editable text area of the control. Typing text in the\\neditable text area of a control can have an immediate effect on the program,\\nbut it\\'s more common practice to wait until some other action takes place (like\\na click on a push button) before the program reads the user-entered text.\\nColor control\\nThe BColorControl class, shown in Chapter 5, creates color controls. A color\\ncontrol displays the 256 system colors, each in a small square. The user can\\nchoose a color by clicking on it. A program can, at any time, check to see\\nwhich color the user has currently selected, and perform some action based\\non that choice. Often the selected color is used in the next, or all subsequent,\\ndrawing operation the program performs.\\nFigure 6-1 shows four of the six types of controls available to you. In the upper\\nleft of the figure is a button. The control in the upper right is a text field. The\\nlower left of the figure shows a checkbox in both its on and off states, while the\\nlower right of the figure shows a radio button in both its states. A picture button\\ncan have any size and look you want, so it\\'s not shown. All the buttons are associated with labels that appear on or next to the controls themselves.\\nThe sixth control type, the color control based on the BColorControl class, isn\\'t\\nshown either--it was described in detail in Chapter 5 and will only be mentioned\\nin passing in this chapter.\\nA control can be in an enabled statewhere the user can interact with itor a\\ndisabled state. A disabled control will appear dim, and clicking on the control will\\nhave no effect. Figure 6-2 shows a button control in both its enabled state (leftmost in the figure) and its disabled state (rightmost in the figure). Also shown is\\nwhat an enabled button looks like when it is selected using the Tab key (middle\\nin the figure). A user can press the Tab key to cycle through controls, making each\\none in turn the current control. As shown in Figure 6-2, a button\\'s label will be\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFigure 6-1. Examples of button, text field, checkbox, and radio button controls\\n\\nunderlined when it\\'s current. Once current, other key presses (typically the Return\\nand Enter key) affect that control.\\n\\nFigure 6-2. A button control that\\'s (from left to right) enabled, current, and disabled\\n\\nCreating a Control\\nA control is created from one of six Interface Kit classes--each of which is covered in detail in this chapter. Let us start by examining the BControl class from\\nwhich they are derived.\\nThe BControl class\\nThe BControl class is an abstract class derived from the BView and BInvoker\\nclasses. Control objects are created from BControl-derived classes, so all controls\\nare types of views.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to create controls that aren\\'t based on the BControl\\nclass. In fact, the Be API does that for the BListView and\\nBMenuItem classes. These are exceptions, though. You\\'ll do best by\\nbasing each of your application\\'s controls on one of the six\\nBControl-derived classes. Doing so means your controls will\\nbehave as expected by the user.\\n\\nBControl is an abstract class, so your project will create BControl-derived class\\nobjects rather than BControl objects. However, because the constructor of each\\nBControl-derived class invokes the BControl constructor, a study of the\\nBControl constructor is a worthwhile endeavor. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nBControl(BRect\\nconst char\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nFour of the six BControl constructor parameters match BView constructor parameters. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags arguments get passed to the\\nBView constructor by the BControl constructor. These parameters are discussed\\nin Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, so here I\\'ll offer only a brief recap of\\ntheir purposes. The frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of\\nthe view. The name parameter establishes a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The resizingMode parameter is a mask that defines the behavior of the view should the size of the view\\'s parent view change. The flags\\nparameter is a mask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of notifications (such as update) the view is to be aware of.\\nThe remaining two BControl constructor parameters are specific to the control.\\nThe label parameter is a string that defines the text associated with it. For\\ninstance, for a button control, the label holds the words that appear on the button. The message parameter is a BMessage object that provides a means for the\\nsystem to recognize the control as a unique entity. When the control is selected by\\nthe user, it is this message that the system will send to the window that holds the\\ncontrol.\\nYour project won\\'t create BControl objects, so a sample call to the BControl\\nconstructor isn\\'t useful here. Instead, let\\'s look at the simplest type of BControlderived object: the BButton.\\nThe BButton class\\nCreating a new push button involves creating a new BButton object. The\\nBButton constructor parameters are an exact match of those used by the\\nBControl constructor:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor invokes the BControl constructor, passing all of its\\narguments to that routine. The BControl constructor uses the label argument to\\ninitialize the button\\'s label, and uses the message argument to assign a unique\\nmessage to the button. The BControl constructor then invokes the BView constructor, passing along the remaining four arguments it received from the BButton\\nconstructor. The BView constructor then sets up the button as a view. After the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nBControl and BView constructors have executed, the BButton constructor carries on with its creation of a button object by implementing button-specific tasks.\\nThis is, in essence, how the constructor for each of the BControl-derived classes\\nworks.\\nCreating a button\\nA button is created by defining the arguments that are passed to the BButton constructor and then invoking that constructor using new. To become functional, the\\nbutton must then be added to a window. That\\'s what\\'s taking place in this snippet:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nconst char* buttonName = \"OKButton\";\\nconst char* buttonLabel = \"OK\";\\nBButton\\n*buttonOK;\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonOK);\\n\\nIn the above code, the BRect variable buttonRect defines the size and location\\nof the button. This push button will be 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels high. The\\nbuttonName string gives the button the name \"OKButton.\" This is the name used\\nto locate and access the button by view name using the BView member function\\nFindView(). The name that actually appears on the button itself, \"OK,\" is defined\\nby the buttonLabel string. The message associated with the new button control\\nis a new BMessage object of type BUTTON_OK_MSG. I\\'ll explain the BMessage class\\nin a minute. Here it suffices to say that, as shown above, creating a new message\\ncan be as easy as defining a four-character string and passing this constant to the\\nBMessage constructor.\\nThe BButton constructor prototype lists six parameters, yet the above invocation\\nof that constructor passes only four arguments. The fifth and sixth parameters,\\nresizingMode and flags, offer default values that are used when these arguments are omitted. The default resizingMode value (B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP) creates a button that will remain a fixed distance from the left and\\ntop edges of the control\\'s parent view should the parent view be resized. The\\ndefault flags value (B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE) specifies that the control\\nneeds to be redrawn if altered, and that it can become the focus view in response\\nto keyboard actions.\\nAdding a control to a window means adding the control to a view. In the above\\nsnippet, it\\'s assumed that a view (perhaps an object of the application-defined\\nBView-derived MyDrawView class) has already been created.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nEnabling and disabling a control\\nWhen a control is created, it is initially enabled--the user can click on the control\\nto select it. If you want a control to be disabled, invoke the control\\'s\\nSetEnabled() member function. The following line of code disables the\\nbuttonOK button control that was created in the previous snippet:\\nbuttonOK->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nSetEnabled() can be invoked on a control at any time, but if the control is to\\nstart out disabled, call SetEnabled() before displaying the window the control\\nappears in. To again enable a control, call SetEnabled() with an argument of\\ntrue.\\nThis chapter\\'s CheckBoxNow project demonstrates the enabling and disabling of a\\nbutton. The technique in that example can be used on any type of control.\\nTurning a control on and off\\nCheckboxes and radio buttons are two-state controls--they can be on or off.\\nWhen a control of either of these two types is created, it is initially off. If you want\\nthe control on (to check a checkbox or fill in a radio button), invoke the\\nBControl member function SetValue(). Passing SetValue() the Be-defined\\nconstant B_CONTROL_ON sets the control to on. Turning a control on and off in\\nresponse to a user action in the control is the responsibility of the system--not\\nyour program. So after creating a control and setting it to the state you want, you\\nwill seldom need to call SetValue(). If you want your program to \"manually\"\\nturn a control off (as opposed to doing so in response to a user action), have the\\ncontrol invoke its SetValue() function with an argument of B_CONTROL_OFF.\\nA button is a one-state device, so turning a button on or off doesn\\'t make sense.\\nInstead, this snippet turns on a two-state control--a checkbox:\\nrequirePasswordCheckBox->SetValue(B_CONTROL_ON)\\n\\nCreating checkboxes hasn\\'t been covered yet, so you\\'ll want to look at the CheckBox example project later in this chapter to see the complete code for creating and\\nturning on a checkbox.\\n\\nTechnically, a button is also a two-state control. When it is not being\\nclicked, it\\'s off. When the control is being clicked (and before the\\nuser releases the mouse button), it\\'s on. This point is merely an\\naside, though, as it\\'s unlikely that your program will ever need to\\ncheck the state of a button in the way it will check the state of a\\ncheckbox or radio button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo check the current state of a control, invoke the BControl member function\\nValue(). This routine returns an int32 value that is either B_CONTROL_ON (which\\nis defined to be 1) or B_CONTROL_OFF (which is defined to be 0). This snippet\\nobtains the current state of a checkbox, then compares the value of the state to the\\nBe-defined constant B_CONTROL_ON:\\n\\ncontrolState;\\n\\ncontrolState = requirePasswordCheckBox->Value();\\nif (controlState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// password required, display password text field\\n\\nChanging a control\\'s label\\nBoth checkboxes and radio buttons have a label that appears to the right of the\\ncontrol. A text field has a label to the left of the control. The control\\'s label is set\\nwhen the control is created, but it can be changed on the fly.\\nThe BControl member function SetLabel() accepts a single argument: the text\\nthat is to be used in place of the control\\'s existing label. In this next snippet, a\\nbutton\\'s label is initially set to read \"Click,\" but is changed to the string \"Click\\nAgain\" at some point in the program\\'s execution:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonName = \"ClickButton\";\\n*buttonLabel = \"Click\";\\n*buttonClick;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_CLICK_MSG));\\naView->AddChild(buttonClick);\\n...\\n...\\nbuttonClick->SetLabel(\"Click Again\");\\n\\nThe labels of other types of controls are changed in the same manner. The last\\nexample project in this chapter, the TextField project, sets the label of a button to\\na string entered by the user.\\n\\nHandling a Control\\nBControl-derived classes take care of some of the work of handling a control. For\\ninstance, in order to properly update a control in response to a mouse button\\nclick, your program doesn\\'t have to keep track of the control\\'s current state, and it\\ndoesn\\'t have to include any code to set the control to the proper state (such as\\ndrawing or erasing the check mark in a checkbox). What action your program\\ntakes in response to a mouse button click is, however, your program\\'s responsibility. When the user clicks on a control, a message will be delivered to the affected\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nwindow. That message will be your program\\'s prompt to perform whatever action\\nis appropriate.\\nMessages and the BMessage class\\nWhen the Application Server delivers a system message to an application\\nwindow, that message arrives in the form of a BMessage object. Your code determines how to handle a system message simply by overriding a BView hook function (such as MouseDown()). Because the routing of a message from the Application Server to a window and then possibly to a view\\'s hook function is\\nautomatically handled for you, the fact that the message is a BMessage object may\\nnot have been important (or even known) to you. A control also makes use of a\\nBMessage object. However, in the case of a control, you need to know a little bit\\nabout working with BMessage objects.\\nThe BMessage class defines a message object as a container that holds information. Referring to the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of\\nthe Be Book, you\\'ll find that this information consists of a name, some number of\\nbytes of data, and a type code. You\\'ll be pleased to find out that when using a\\nBMessage in conjunction with a control, a thorough knowledge of these details of\\nthe BMessage class isn\\'t generally necessary (complex applications aside). Instead,\\nall you need to know of this class is how to create a BMessage object. The snippet a few pages back that created a BButton object illustrated how that\\'s done:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\n// variable declarations here\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nThe only information you need to create a BMessage object is a four-character literal, as in the above definition of BUTTON_OK_MSG as `btmg\\'. This value, which\\nwill serve as the what field of the message, is actually a uint32. So you can\\ndefine the constant as an unsigned 32-bit integer, though most programmers find it\\neasier to remember a literal than the unsigned numeric equivalent. This value then\\nbecomes the argument to the BMessage constructor in the BButton constructor.\\nThis newly created message object won\\'t hold any other information.\\nThe BMessage class defines a single public data member named what. The what\\ndata member holds the four-character string that distinguishes the message from all\\nother message types--including system messages--the application will use. In the\\nprevious snippet, the constant btmg becomes the what data member of the\\nBMessage object created when invoking the BButton constructor.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nWhen the program refers to a system message by its Be-defined constant, such as\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED or B_KEY_DOWN, what\\'s really of interest is the what data\\nmember of the system message. The value of each Be-defined message constant is\\na four-character string composed of a combination of only uppercase characters\\nand, optionally, one or more underscore characters. Here\\'s how Be defines a few\\nof the system message constants:\\nenum {\\nB_ABOUT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_QUIT_REQUESTED\\n...\\n...\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n...\\n...\\n};\\n\\n= \\'_ABR\\',\\n\\n= \\'_QRQ\\',\\n\\n= \\'_MDN\\',\\n\\nBe intentionally uses the message constant value convention of uppercase-only\\ncharacters and underscores to make it obvious that a message is a system message. You can easily avoid duplicating a Be-defined message constant by simply\\nincluding one or more lowercase characters in the literal of your own applicationdefined message constants. And to make it obvious that a message isn\\'t a Bedefined one, don\\'t start the message constant name with \"B_\". In this book\\'s\\nexamples, I have chosen to use a fairly informative convention in choosing symbols for application-defined control messages: start with the control type, include a\\nword or words descriptive of what action the control results in, and end with\\n\"MSG\" for \"message.\" The value of each constant may hint at the message type\\n(for instance, `plSD\\' for \"play sound\"), but aside from avoiding all uppercase characters, the value is somewhat arbitrary. These two examples illustrate the convention I use:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_PLAY_SOUND_MSG\\nCALCULATE_VALUES\\n\\n\\'plSD\\'\\n\\'calc\\'\\n\\nMessages and the MessageReceived() member function\\nThe BWindow class is derived from the BLooper class, so a window is a type of\\nlooper--an object that runs a message loop that receives messages from the Application Server. The BLooper class is derived from the BHandler class, so a window is also a handler--an object that can handle messages that are dispatched\\nfrom a message loop. A window can both receive messages and handle them.\\nFor the most part, system messages are handled automatically; for instance, when\\na B_ZOOM message is received, the operating system zooms the window. But you\\ncannot completely entrust the handling of an application-defined message to the\\nsystem.\\n\\x0cIntroduction to Controls\\n\\n\\nWhen a user selects a control, the Application Server delivers a message object\\nwith the appropriate what data member value to the affected BWindow object.\\nYou\\'ve just seen a snippet that created a BButton associated with a BMessage\\nobject. That BMessage had a what data member of `btmg\\'. If the user clicked on\\nthe button that results from this object, the Application Server would deliver such\\na message to the affected BWindow. It\\'s up to the window to include code that\\nwatches for, and responds to, this type of message. The BWindow class member\\nfunction MessageReceived() is used for this purpose.\\nWhen an application-defined message reaches a window, it looks for a\\nMessageReceived() function. This routine receives the message, examines the\\nmessage\\'s what data member, and responds depending on its value. The\\nBHandler class defines such a MessageReceived() function. The BHandlerderived class BWindow inherits this function and overrides it. The BWindow version includes a call to the base class BHandler version, thus augmenting what\\nBHandler offers. If the BWindow version of MessageReceived() can\\'t handle a\\nmessage, it passes it up to the BHandler version of this routine. Figure 6-3 shows\\nhow a message that can\\'t be handled by one version of MessageReceived() gets\\npassed up to the next version of this function.\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBHandler\\nversion\\nmessage\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow\\nversion\\nmessage\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nmessage\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\nBWindow-derived\\nversion\\n\\nFigure 6-3. Message passed to parent class\\'s version of MessageReceived()\\n\\nHere is how the MessageReceived() looks in BWindow:\\nvoid BWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle B_KEY_DOWN and scripting-related system messages\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\ndefault:\\nBHandler::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nYour project\\'s windows won\\'t be based directly on the BWindow class. Instead,\\nwindows will be objects of a class you derive from BWindow. While such a\\nBWindow-derived class will inherit the BWindow version of MessageReceived(),\\nthat version of the function won\\'t suffice--it won\\'t know anything about the application-defined messages you\\'ve paired with the window\\'s controls. Your BWindowderived class should thus do what the BWindow class does: override the inherited\\nversion of MessageReceived() and, within the new implementation of this function, invoke the inherited version:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\n// handle application-defined messages\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhat messages your BWindow-derived class version of MessageReceived() looks\\nfor depends on the controls you\\'re adding to windows of that class type. If I add a\\nsingle button to windows of the MyHelloWindow class, and the button\\'s BButton\\nconstructor pairs a message object with a what constant of BUTTON_OK_MSG (as\\nshown in previous snippets), the MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived()\\nwould look like this:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\n// handle a click on the OK button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe particular code that appears under the control\\'s case label depends entirely\\non what action you want to occur in response to the control being clicked. For\\nsimplicity, assume that we want a click on the OK button to do nothing more than\\nsound a beep. The completed version of MessageReceived() looks like this:\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_OK_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nButtons\\nThe BButton class is used to create a button--a labeled push button that is operated when the button is clicked. The previous sections used the BButton class\\nand button objects for its specific examples and in its code snippets. That section\\nprovided some background on creating and working with buttons, so the emphasis here will be on incorporating the button-related code in a project.\\n\\nCreating a Button\\nThe BButton constructor has six parameters, each of which was described in the\\n\"The BButton class\" section of this chapter:\\nBButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BButton constructor calls the BControl constructor, which in turn calls the\\nBView constructor. Together, these routines set up and initialize a BButton object.\\nAfter attaching the button to a window, the height of the button may automatically be adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the button\\'s label and\\nthe border of the button. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates result in\\na button that isn\\'t high enough, the BButton constructor will increase the button\\nheight by increasing the value of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact\\nheight of the button depends on the font in which the button label is displayed.\\nFor the example button creation code, assume that a window is keeping track of\\nBView and BButton objects in data members named fView and fButton, respectively, and that the button\\'s message type is defined by the constant BUTTON_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_MSG\\n\\n\\'bttn\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nprivate:\\nBView\\nBButton\\n\\n*fView;\\n*fButton;\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe code that creates a new button and adds it to the view fView might then look\\nlike this:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, \"MyButton\",\\n\"Click Me\", new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfView->AddChild(fButton);\\n\\nMaking a Button the Default Button\\nOne button in a window can be made the default button--a button that the user\\ncan select either by clicking or by pressing the Enter key. If a button is the default\\nbutton, it is given a wider border so that the user recognizes it as such a button.\\nTo make a button the default button, call the BButton member function\\nMakeDefault():\\nfButton->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nIf the window that holds the new default button already had a default button, the\\nold default button automatically loses its default status and becomes a \"normal\"\\nbutton. The system handles this task to ensure that a window has only one default\\nbutton.\\nWhile granting one button default status may be a user-friendly gesture, it might\\nalso not make sense in many cases. Thus, a window isn\\'t required to have a\\ndefault button.\\n\\nButton Example Project\\nThe TwoButtons project demonstrates how to create a window that holds two buttons. Looking at Figure 6-4, you can guess that a click on the leftmost button\\n(which is the default button) results in the playing of the system sound a single\\ntime, while a click on the other button produces the beep twice.\\nPreparing the window class for the buttons\\nA few additions to the code in the MyHelloWindow.h file are in order. First, a pair\\nof constants are defined to be used later when the buttons are created. The choice\\nof constant names and values is unimportant, provided that the names don\\'t begin\\nwith \"B_\" and that the constant values don\\'t consist of all uppercase characters.\\n\\x0cButtons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-4. The window that results from running the TwoButtons program\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s two buttons, a pair of data members of type\\nBButton are added to the already present data member of type MyDrawView. And\\nnow that the window will be receiving and responding to application-defined\\nmessages, the BWindow-inherited member function MessageReceived() needs to\\noverridden:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the buttons\\nThe buttons are created and added to the window in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, the constructor declares several variables that will be\\nused in the pair of calls to the BButton constructor and assigns them values:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*buttonBeep2Label = \"Beep Two\";\\n\\nIn the past, you\\'ve seen that I normally declare a variable within the routine that\\nuses it, just before its use. Here I\\'ve declared the six variables that are used as\\nBButton constructor arguments outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor--but\\nthey could just as well have been declared within the MyHelloWindow constructor. I opted to do things this way to get in the habit of grouping all of a window\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nlayout-defining code together. Grouping all the button boundary rectangles,\\nnames, and labels together makes it easier to lay out the buttons in relation to one\\nanother and to supply them with logical, related names and labels. This technique\\nis especially helpful when a window holds several controls.\\nThe buttons will be added to the fMyView view. Recall that this view is of the\\nBView-derived application-defined class MyDrawView and occupies the entire content area of a MyHelloWindow. In the MyHelloWindow constructor, the view is\\ncreated first, and then the buttons are created and added to the view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling button clicks\\nMessageReceived() always has a similar format. The Application Server passes\\nthis function a message as an argument. The message data member what holds\\nthe message type, so that data member should be examined in a switch statement, with the result compared to any application-defined message types the window is capable of handling. A window of type MyHelloWindow can handle a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_1_MSG and a BUTTON_BEEP_2_MSG. If a different type of message is\\nencountered, it gets passed on to the BWindow version of MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPicture Buttons\\nA picture button is a button that has a picture on its face rather than a text label.\\nThe picture button behaves like a standard push button--clicking and releasing\\nthe mouse button while over the picture button selects it.\\nThe BPictureButton class is used to create a picture button. Associated with one\\nBPictureButton object are two BPicture objects. One of the pictures acts as the\\nbutton when the button is in its normal state (that is, when the user isn\\'t clicking\\non it). The other picture acts as the button when the user clicks on the button.\\nYou\\'ll supply a BPictureButton object with the two pictures, and the system will\\nbe responsible for switching back and forth between the pictures in response to\\nthe user\\'s actions.\\n\\nCreating a Picture Button\\nA picture button is created by the BPictureButton constructor. As is the case for\\nother controls, this constructor invokes the BControl constructor, which in turn\\ninvokes the BView constructor:\\nBPictureButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*off,\\n*on,\\n*message,\\nbehavior = B_ONE_STATE_BUTTON,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BPictureButton constructor has eight parameters, five of which you\\'re\\nalready familiar with. The frame, name, resizingMode, and flags parameters\\nget passed to the BView constructor and are used in setting up the picture button\\nas a view. The message parameter is used by the BControl constructor to assign\\na message type to the picture button. The remaining three parameters, off, on,\\nand behavior, are specific to the creation of a picture button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nThe off and on parameters are BPicture objects that define the two pictures to\\nbe used to display the button. In Chapter 5, you saw how to create a BPicture\\nobject using the BPicture member functions BeginPicture() and\\nEndPicture(). Here I create a picture composed of a white circle within a black\\ncircle:\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillEllipse(aRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\n\\nA second BPicture object should then be created in the same way. These two\\nBPicture objects could then be used as the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBPictureButton constructor.\\n\\nFor more compelling graphic images, you can use bitmaps for button pictures. Once a bitmap exists, all that needs to appear between\\nthe BeginPicture() and EndPicture() calls is a call to the BView\\nmember function DrawBitMap(). Chapter 10, Files, discusses bitmaps.\\n\\nPicture buttons are actually more versatile than described in this section. Here the\\npicture button is treated as a one-state device--just as a standard push button is.\\nThe BPictureButton class can also be used, however, to create a picture button\\nthat is a two-state control. Setting the behavior parameter to the constant B_TWO_\\nSTATE_BUTTON tells the BPictureButton constructor to create a picture button\\nthat, when clicked on, toggles between the two pictures represented by the\\nBPicture parameters off and on. Clicking on such a picture button displays one\\npicture. Clicking on the button again displays the second picture. The displayed\\npicture indicates to the user the current state of the button. To see a good realworld use of a two-state picture button, run the BeIDE. Then choose Find from\\nthe Edit menu. In the lower-left area of the Find window you\\'ll find a button that\\nhas a picture of a small file icon on it. Click on the button and it will now have a\\npicture of two small file icons on it. This button is used to toggle between two\\nsearch options: search only the currently open, active file, and search all files\\npresent in the Find window list. Figure 6-5 shows both of this button\\'s two states.\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe two states of the same\\npicture button\\n\\nFigure 6-5. The Find window of the BeIDE provides an example of a picture button\\n\\nPicture Button Example Project\\nThe PictureButton project creates a program that displays a window that holds a\\nsingle picture button. Figure 6-6 shows this one window under two different conditions. The leftmost window in the figure shows the button in its normal state.\\nThe rightmost window shows that when the button is clicked it gets slightly\\nsmaller and its center is filled in.\\n\\nFigure 6-6. The window that results from running the PictureButton program\\n\\nThe picture button can include other pictures, which will be used if\\nthe program lets the button be disabled. Now that you know the\\nbasics of working with the BPictureButton class, the details of\\nenhancing your picture buttons will be a quick read in the\\nBPictureButton section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be\\nBook.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the picture button\\nThis chapter\\'s TwoButtons example project (presented in the \"Buttons\" section)\\nprovided a plan for adding a control, and support of that control, to a window.\\nHere\\'s how the window class header file (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this\\nproject) is set up for a new control:\\n\\n\\nDefine a constant to be used to represent an application-defined message type\\n\\n\\n\\nOverride MessageReceived() in the window class declaration\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a control data member in the window class declaration\\n\\nHere\\'s how the MyHelloWindow class is affected by the addition of a picture button to a window of this class type:\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBPictureButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fPicButtonBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nI\\'ve defined the PICTURE_BEEP_MSG constant to have a value of\\n\\'bep1\\'. Looking back at the TwoButtons example project, you\\'ll see\\nthat this is the same value I gave to that project\\'s BUTTON_BEEP_1_\\nMSG constant. If both controls were present in the same application,\\nI\\'d give one of these two constants a different value so that the\\nMessageReceived() function could distinguish between a click on\\nthe Beep One push button and a click on the picture button.\\n\\nCreating the picture button\\nThe process of creating a control can also be expressed in a number of steps. All\\nof the following affect the window source code file (the MyHelloWindow.cpp file\\nin this particular example):\\n\\n\\nDeclare and assign values to the variables to be used in the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate the control using new and the control\\'s constructor\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach the control to the window by adding it to one of the window\\'s views\\n\\x0cPicture Buttons\\n\\n\\nFollowing the above steps to add a picture button to the MyHelloWindow constructor results in a new version of this routine that looks like this:\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBPicture\\nBPicture\\n\\n*buttonOffPict;\\n*buttonOnPict;\\n\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect offRect;\\nfMyView->FillRect(offRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(offRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOffPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfMyView->BeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect onRect;\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfMyView->StrokeRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nfMyView->FillRect(onRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\nbuttonOnPict = fMyView->EndPicture();\\nfPicButtonBeep = new BPictureButton(pictureBeep1Rect, pictureBeep1Name,\\nbuttonOffPict, buttonOnPict,\\nnew BMessage(PICTURE_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fPicButtonBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe two BPicture objects are defined using a few of the basic drawing techniques covered in Chapter 5. As you read the following, refer back to the picture\\nbutton in its off state (normal, or unclicked) and on state (being clicked) in\\nFigure 6-5.\\nThe off picture fills in a rectangle with the B_SOLID_LOW pattern (solid white) to\\nerase the on picture that might currently be displayed (if the user has just clicked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nthe picture button, the on picture will be serving as the picture button). Then a\\nrectangle is outlined to serve as the off button.\\nThe on picture erases the off picture (should it be currently drawn to the window\\nas the picture button) by drawing a white (B_SOLID_LOW) rectangle outline with\\nthe boundaries of the off picture rectangle. That rectangle is then inset two pixels\\nin each direction and a new rectangle is framed in black (B_SOLID_HIGH). The\\nrectangle is then inset two more pixels, and this new area is filled with black.\\nHandling a picture button click\\nTo handle a click on the picture button, MessageReceived() now looks for a\\nmessage of type PICTURE_BEEP_MSG. Should that message reach the window, the\\ncomputer sounds the system beep one time:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckboxes\\nThe BCheckBox class is used to add checkboxes to a window. A BCheckBox\\nobject includes both the checkbox itself and a label, or title, to the right of the\\nbox. A checkbox is a two-state control: in the on state, the checkbox has an \"X\" in\\nit; when off, it is empty. When a user clicks on a checkbox, its state is toggled. It\\'s\\nworthy of note that a checkbox label is considered a part of the checkbox control. That means that a user\\'s click on the checkbox itself or anywhere on the\\ncheckbox label will toggle the checkbox to its opposite state.\\nWhether a click results in a checkbox being turned on (checked) or off\\n(unchecked), a message is sent to the window that holds the checkbox. While a\\nprogram can immediately respond to a click on a checkbox, it is more typical for\\nthe program to wait until some other action takes place before responding. For\\ninstance, the setting of some program feature could be done via a checkbox.\\nClicking the checkbox wouldn\\'t, however, immediately change the setting. Instead,\\nwhen the user dismisses the window the checkbox resides in, the value of the\\ncheckbox can be queried and the setting of the program feature could be performed at that time.\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nCreating a Checkbox\\nThe BCheckBox constructor has six parameters:\\nBCheckBox(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BCheckBox parameters match those used in the BButton constructor--if you\\nknow how to create a button, you know how to create a checkbox. Adding to the\\nsimilarities is that after you attach the checkbox to a window, the control\\'s height\\nwill be automatically adjusted to accommodate the height of the text of the control\\'s label. If the values of the frame rectangle coordinates don\\'t produce a\\nrectangle with a height sufficient to display the checkbox label, the BCheckBox\\nconstructor will increase the checkbox boundary rectangle height by increasing the\\nvalue of the frame rectangle\\'s bottom value. The exact height of the checkbox\\ndepends on the font in which the control\\'s label is displayed.\\nAs for other control types, you\\'ll define a message constant that is to be paired\\nwith the control. For instance:\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_MSG\\n\\n\\'ckbx\\'\\n\\nThen, optionally, add a data member of the control type to the class declaration of\\nthe window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBButton\\n*fCheckBox;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet is typical of the code you\\'ll write to create a new checkbox\\nand add that control to a view:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfCheckBox = new BCheckBox(checkBoxRect,\"MyCheckbox\"\\n\"Check Me\", new BMessage(CHECKBOX_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBox);\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Now) Example Project\\nClicking a checkbox may have an immediate effect on some aspect of the program, or it may not have an impact on the program until the user confirms the\\ncheckbox selection--usually by a click on a button. The former use of a check-\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nbox is demonstrated in the example project described here: CheckBoxNow. For an\\nexample of the other usage, a checkbox that has an effect after another action is\\ntaken, look over the next example, the CheckBoxLater project.\\nThe use of a checkbox to initiate an immediate action is often in practice when\\nsome area of the window the checkbox resides in is to be altered. For instance, if\\nsome controls in a window are to be rendered unusable in certain conditions, a\\ncheckbox can be used to disable (and then later enable) these controls. This is\\nhow the checkbox in the CheckBoxNow example works. The CheckBoxNow\\nproject creates a program with a window that holds two controls: a button and a\\ncheckbox. When the program launches, both controls are enabled, and the checkbox is unchecked--as shown in the top window in Figure 6-7. As expected, clicking on the Beep One button produces a single system beep. Clicking on the\\ncheckbox disables beeping by disabling the button. The bottom window in\\nFigure 6-7 shows how the program\\'s one window looks after clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox.\\n\\nFigure 6-7. The windows that result from running the CheckBoxNow program\\n\\nPreparing the Window class for the checkbox\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h file prepares for the window\\'s support of a button and a\\ncheckbox by defining a constant for each control\\'s message:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'stbp\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class now holds three data members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0cCheckboxes\\n\\n\\nBButton\\nBCheckBox\\n\\n*fCheckBoxSetBeep;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the checkbox\\nI\\'ve declared and initialized the button and checkbox boundary rectangles near\\none another so that I could line them up--Figure 6-6 shows that the checkbox is\\njust to the right of the button and centered vertically with the button.\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*checkBoxSetBeepName = \"SetBeep\";\\n= \"Beep One\";\\n*checkBoxSetBeepLabel = \"Disable Beeping\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates both the button and checkbox:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfCheckBoxSetBeep = new BCheckBox(checkBoxSetBeepRect, checkBoxSetBeepName,\\ncheckBoxSetBeepLabel,\\nnew BMessage(CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fCheckBoxSetBeep);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a checkbox click\\nWhen the checkbox is clicked, the system will toggle it to its opposite state and\\nthen send a message of the application-defined type CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG to\\nthe MyHelloWindow MessageReceived() routine. In response, this message\\'s\\ncase section obtains the new state of the checkbox and enables or disables the\\nBeep One button as appropriate. If the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, or\\non, the button is disabled by passing a value of false to the button\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nSetEnabled() routine. If the checkbox is unchecked, or off, a value of true is\\npassed to this same routine in order to enable the button:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, deactivate beep button\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, activate beep button\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nCheckbox (Action Later) Example Project\\nThe CheckBoxNow project responds immediately to a click on a checkbox. More\\noften, programs let users check or uncheck the checkboxes without any immediate effect. Thus, your program might reserve action until the choice is confirmed\\nby the user\\'s click on a button (such as OK, Done, or Accept). The CheckBoxLater project demonstrates this approach. Figure 6-7 shows that the CheckBoxLater program displays a window that looks similar to that displayed by the\\nCheckBoxNow program. The program differs in when the state of the checkbox is\\nqueried by the program. In the CheckBoxLater program, clicking the Disable\\nBeeping checkbox any number of times has no immediate effect on the Beep One\\nbutton (in Figure 6-8, you see that the checkbox is checked, yet the button isn\\'t\\ndisabled). It\\'s only when the user clicks the Beep One button that the program\\nchecks to see if the Disable Beeping checkbox is checked. If it isn\\'t checked, the\\nbutton click plays the system beep. If it is checked, the button can still be clicked,\\nbut no sound will be played.\\nThe only changes that were made to the CheckBoxNow code to turn it into the\\ncode for the CheckBoxLater project are in the MessageReceived() function.\\nHere\\'s how the new version of that routine looks:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-8. The window that results from running the CheckBoxLater program\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetBeep->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON)\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is checked, meaning DON\\'T beep\\n;\\nelse\\n// Disable Beeping checkbox is unchecked, meaning DO beep\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG:\\n// Here we don\\'t do anything. Instead, we wait until the user\\n// performs some other action before checking the value of the\\n// checkbox break;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIn MessageReceived(), the body of the CHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case section\\nperforms no action--a message of this type is now essentially ignored. The program would run the same even if this case section was removed, but I\\'ve left the\\nCHECKBOX_SET_BEEP_MSG case label in the switch so that it\\'s evident that\\nMessageReceived() is still the recipient of such messages.\\n\\nRadio Buttons\\nA radio button is similar to a checkbox in that it is a two-state control. Unlike a\\ncheckbox, though, a radio button always appears grouped with at least one other\\ncontrol of its kind.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nFor any given radio button group, no more than one radio button can be on at\\nany time. When the user clicks on one button in a group, the button that was on\\nat the time of the click is turned off and the newly clicked button is turned on. A\\nradio button group is responsible for updating the state of its buttons--your code\\nwon\\'t need to turn them on and off.\\n\\nCreating a Radio Button\\nThe BRadioButton constructor has the same six parameters described back in this\\nchapter\\'s \"The BControl class\" section:\\nBRadioButton(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nLike other types of controls, a radio button\\'s height will be adjusted if the height\\nspecified in the frame rectangle isn\\'t enough to accommodate the font being used\\nto display the radio button\\'s label.\\nBefore creating a new radio button, define a constant to be used as the control\\'s\\nmessage type. Here\\'s an example from a project that has two radio buttons in a\\nwindow:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess to a radio button is easiest if a data member of the control type is added to\\nthe class declaration of the window type the control is to be added to:\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\n}\\n\\nThe following snippet shows the creation of two radio buttons, each of which is\\nadded to the same view:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n\\n\"One\", new BMessage(RADIO_1_MSG));\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\n\"Two\", new BMessage(RADIO_2_MSG));\\n\\nBy adding radio buttons to the same view, you designate that the buttons be considered a part of a radio button group. The simple act of placing a number of buttons in the same view is enough to have these buttons act in unison. A click on\\none radio button turns that button on, but not until that button turns off all other\\nradio buttons in the same view.\\nA single window can have any number of radio button groups, or sets. For\\ninstance, a window might have one group of three buttons that provides the user\\nwith the option of displaying graphic images in monochrome, grayscale, or color.\\nThis same window could also have a radio button group that provides the user\\nwith a choice of four filters to apply to the image. In such a scenario, the window\\nwould need to include a minimum of two views--one for the group of three\\ncolor-level radio buttons and another for the group of four filter radio buttons.\\n\\nRadio Buttons Example Project\\nThe RadioButtonGroup project demonstrates how to create a group of radio buttons. As shown in Figure 6-9, the RadioButtonGroup program\\'s window includes a\\ngroup of three radio buttons that allow the user to alter the behavior of the Beep\\npush button.\\n\\nFigure 6-9. The window that results from running the RadioButtonGroup program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the radio buttons\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file includes four control message constants--one\\nper control. The push button constant has been given the value \\'bEEp\\' just to\\nillustrate that an application-defined message constant can include uppercase characters (to avoid conflicting with Be-defined control message constants, it just\\nshouldn\\'t consist of all uppercase characters).\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\'bEEp\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nThis project\\'s version of the MyHelloWindow class includes six data members: one\\nto keep track of the window\\'s view, one to keep track of each of the window\\'s\\nfour controls, and one to keep track of the number of beeps to play when the\\npush button is clicked:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLaying out the radio buttons\\nA number of radio buttons are defined as a group when they all reside in the same\\nview. A MyHelloWindow object includes a view (MyDrawView) that occupies its\\nentire content area--so I could add the three radio buttons to this view and have\\nthem automatically become a radio button group. That, however, isn\\'t what I\\'m\\nabout to do. Instead, I\\'ll create a new view and add it to the existing view. If at a\\nlater time I want to add a second group of radio buttons (to control some other,\\nunrelated, option) to the window, the buttons that will comprise that group will\\nneed to be in a new view--otherwise they\\'ll just be absorbed into the existing\\nradio button group. By creating a new view that exists just for one group of radio\\nbuttons, I\\'m getting in the habit of setting up a radio button group as an isolated\\nentity.\\nPlacing a radio button group in its own new view also proves beneficial if it\\nbecomes necessary to make a change to the layout of all of the group\\'s radio buttons. For instance, if I want to relocate all of the buttons in a group to another\\narea of the window, I just redefine the group\\'s view rectangle rather than redefining each of the individual radio button boundary rectangles. When the view\\nmoves, so do the radio buttons in it. Or, consider that I may, for aesthetic reasons, want to outline the area that holds the radio buttons. I can easily do so by\\nframing the radio button group view.\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nThe following variable declarations appear near the top of the MyHelloWindow.\\ncpp file. Note that the boundary rectangle for each of the three radio buttons has a\\nleft coordinate of 10.0, yet the radio buttons are certainly more than 10 pixels in\\nfrom the left side of the window.\\nKeep in mind that after being created, the radio buttons will be added to a new\\nBView that is positioned in the window based on the radioGroupRect rectangle.\\nThus, the coordinate values of the radio button rectangles are relative to the new\\nBView. Figure 6-10 clarifies my point by showing where the radio group view will\\nbe placed in the window. In that figure, the values 125 and 50 come from the left\\nand top values in the radioGroupRect rectangle declared here:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\n*radioBeep1Label = \"One Beep\";\\n*radioBeep2Label = \"Two Beeps\";\\n*radioBeep3Label = \"Three Beeps\";\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-10. A group of radio buttons can reside in their own view\\n\\nCreating the radio buttons\\nThe three radio buttons are created, as expected, in the MyHelloWindow constructor. Before doing that, a generic view (a view of the Be class BView) to which the\\nradio buttons will be added is created and added to the view of type MyDrawView.\\nBy default, each new radio button is turned off. A group of radio buttons must\\nalways have one button on, so after the three radio buttons are created, one of\\nthem (arbitrarily, the One Beep button) is turned on by calling the button\\'s\\nSetValue() member function. The data member fNumBeeps is then initialized to\\na value that matches the number of beeps indicated by the turned-on radio button:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBView\\n\\n*radioGroupView;\\n\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\",\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a radio button click\\nWhen a radio button is clicked, a message of the appropriate application-defined\\ntype reaches the window\\'s MessageReceived() function. The clicking of a radio\\nbutton, like the clicking of a checkbox, typically doesn\\'t cause an immediate\\naction to occur. Such is the case in this example. MessageReceived() handles\\nthe button click by simply setting the MyHelloWindow data member fNumBeeps to\\nthe value indicated by the clicked-on radio button. When the user eventually clicks\\non the Beep push button, beep() is invoked the appropriate number of times:\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000; // one second\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 3;\\nbreak;\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nfor (i = 1; i <= fNumBeeps; i++) {\\nbeep();\\nif (i != fNumBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nView Hierarchy and Controls\\nChapter 4 introduced the concept of the window view hierarchy--the organization of views within a window. In this chapter\\'s most recent example you\\'ve just\\nseen a window that included a number of views (keeping in mind that a control is\\na type of view). Now that you\\'ve encountered the first example that includes several views, this a good time to revisit the topic of the view hierarchy in order to fill\\nin some of the details. Figure 6-11 shows the view hierarchy for a window--an\\nobject of the MyHelloWindow class--from the RadioButtonGroup program.\\nAdding views to the hierarchy\\nA window\\'s top view is always a \"built-in\" part of the window--you don\\'t explicitly add the top view as you add other views. The BView-derived fMyView view\\nlies directly below the top view, telling you that this view has been added to the\\nwindow. The BButton fButtonBeep1 view and the BView radioGroupView lie\\ndirectly below the fMyView view, so you know that each has been added to\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTop View\\n\\nfmyView\\n\\n\\nradioGroupView\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-11. The view hierarchy for the RadioButtonGroup window\\n\\nfMyView. Finally, the three BRadioButton views are beneath radioGroupView,\\ntelling you that these three views have been added to radioGroupView. You can\\nconfirm this by looking at the six AddChild() calls in the MyHelloWindow constructor--they indicate which parent view each view was added to:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n...\\n...\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nAccessing views\\nThe names of the views in Figure 6-12 tell you how each view is referenced.\\nYou don\\'t draw to the top view--it merely serves as a container for organizing\\nother views. To reference this view (as when adding a view to the window), reference the window itself. In the window\\'s constructor, just call the desired BWindow\\nmember function, as in:\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nFrom outside a window member function, use the fMyWindow data member from\\nthe MyHelloApplication object. If the fMyView view was to be added in the\\nBApplication constructor after the window was created, the call to AddChild()\\nwould look like this:\\nfMyWindow->AddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe Be naming convention states that the name of a class data member should\\nstart with a lowercase \"f\" character. In Figure 6-11 you see that five of the six\\nviews below the top view are referenced by data members. To work with any one\\nof these views, use the data member that references it. For instance, to invoke the\\nBView member function FillRect() to fill a rectangle in the window\\'s fMyView\\nview, just call the routine like this:\\nfMyView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nI haven\\'t kept a data member reference in the MyHelloWindow class to the BView\\nthat groups the three radio buttons. If it became necessary to reference this view,\\nyou could call the BView member function FindView() to locate the view object\\nand return a reference to it. Recall that when a view is created, you give it a name.\\nFor example, the radio group view was given the name \"RadioView\":\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\nfMyView->AddChild(radioGroupView);\\n\\nYou can find the view at any time by calling FindView() from the parent view.\\nFor instance, to fill a rectangle in the radio group view, call FindView() from that\\nview\\'s parent view, fMyView:\\nBView\\n\\n*aView;\\n\\naView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\naView->FillRect(aRect);\\n\\nKeep in mind that there are always two, and may be three, references, associated with one view. When a view is created, the view\\nobject is returned to the program and referenced by a variable (such\\nas radioGroupView in the preceding example). When invoking the\\nBView (or BView-derived) class constructor, a name for the view is\\nsupplied in quotes (as in \"RadioView\" in the preceding example).\\nFinally, some views have a label--a name that is displayed on the\\nview itself (as in a control such as a BButton--the button displays a\\nname such as OK or Beep).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nView Updating\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, the MyHelloWindow constructor creates a view\\nreferenced by the MyHelloWindow data member fMyView and a view referenced\\nby the local BView variable radioGroupView. This one MyHelloWindow constructor shows two ways of working with views, so it will be worth our while to again\\nsidetrack from the discussion of controls in order to gain a better understanding of\\nthe very important topic of views.\\nBView-derived classes and the generic BView class\\nIn the RadioButtonGroup project, and several projects preceding it, I\\'ve opted to\\nfill the content area of a window with a view of the application-defined BViewderived class MyDrawView. One of the chief reasons for defining such a class is to\\nlet the system become responsible for updating a view. This is accomplished by\\nhaving my own class override the BView member function Draw().\\nA second way to work with a view is to not define a view class, but instead simply create a generic BView object within an application-derived routine. That\\'s\\nwhat the RadioButtonGroup project does in the MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nradioGroupView = new BView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\", B_FOLLOW_ALL,\\nB_WILL_DRAW);\\n\\nAfter you attach the new view to an existing view, drawing can take place in the\\nnew view. For instance, if in addition to beeping, you want the program to draw a\\nborder around the three radio buttons in response to a click on the window\\'s one\\npush button, add the following code under the BUTTON_BEEP_MSG case label in\\nthe MessageReceived() function:\\nBView\\nBRect\\n\\n*radioView;\\nradioFrame;\\n\\nradioView = fMyView->FindView(\"RadioView\");\\nradioFrame = radioView->Bounds();\\nradioView->StrokeRect(radioFrame);\\n\\nSuperficially, this approach of creating a generic BView and then drawing in it is\\nsimpler than defining a BView-derived class and then implementing a Draw()\\nfunction for that class. But in taking this easier approach, you lose the benefit of\\nhaving the system take responsibility for updating the view. Consider the above\\nsnippet. That code will nicely frame the three radio buttons. But if the window\\nthat holds the buttons ever needs updating (and if the user is allowed to move the\\nwindow, of course at some point it will), the frame that surrounds the buttons\\nwon\\'t be redrawn. The system will indeed invoke a Draw() function for\\nradioGroupView, but it will be the empty BView version of Draw().\\n\\x0cRadio Buttons\\n\\n\\nImplementing a BView-derived class in the RadioButtonGroup project\\nWhat if I do want my RadioButtonGroup program to frame the radio buttons, and\\nto do so in a way that automatically updates the frame as needed? Instead of placing the radio buttons in a generic BView object, I can define a new BView-derived\\nclass just for this purpose:\\nclass MyRadioView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyRadioView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyRadioView constructor can be empty--just as the MyDrawView constructor\\nis:\\nMyRadioView::MyRadioView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe MyRadioView version of the Draw() function is quite simple as well:\\nvoid MyRadioView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nWhile I could keep track of an instance of the MyRadioView class by calling the\\nparent view\\'s FindView() function as needed, I\\'d opt for the method of storing a\\nreference to the view in the window that will hold the view. Here I\\'ve added such\\na reference to the six existing data members in the MyHelloWindow class of the\\nRadioButtonGroup project:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nMyRadioView\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n*fMyRadioView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create a MyRadioView object, I replace the generic BView creation code in the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor with the following:\\nfMyRadioView = new MyRadioView(radioGroupRect, \"RadioView\");\\nfMyView->AddChild(fMyRadioView);\\n\\nNow, when a radio button is created, I add it to the MyRadioView object\\nfMyRadioView, like this:\\n\\nThanks to the Draw() function of the MyRadioView class, the new radio button\\ngroup will have a border drawn around it, exactly as was shown back in\\nFigure 6-10. Better yet, obscuring the window and then bringing it back to the\\nforefront doesn\\'t cause the border to disappear--the update message that the\\nApplication Server sends to the MyHelloWindow window results in the calling of\\nthe Draw() function of each \"out-of-date\" view in the window.\\nIf you want to see all of the code for this new version of the RadioButtonGroup\\nprogram, you\\'ll find it in the RadioButtonGroupFrame project.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve followed this discussion, you should be able to quickly\\nanswer the following question: in the original RadioButtonGroup\\nproject, why didn\\'t I create a new BView-derived class like the\\nMyRadioView class and use an object of that type to hold the radio\\nbuttons? Answer: because I use the radio button view only as a\\nmeans to group the radio buttons together--I don\\'t draw to the\\nview. The simple approach of creating a BView on the fly works for\\nthat purpose.\\n\\nText Fields\\nThe BTextControl class is used to add a text field to a window. A text field consists of both a static, uneditable label and an editable field that allows the user to\\nenter a single line of text. The label appears to the left of the editable field, and is\\ngenerally used to provide the user with an idea of what to enter in the editable\\nfield (\"Enter your age in years:\" is an example).\\nA text field is often handled like a checkbox or radio button: no immediate action\\nis taken by the program in response to the user\\'s action. Typically, the program\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nacquires the text in the text field only when a button labeled OK, Accept, Save, or\\nsomething similar is clicked on.\\nIf your program needs to get or set the editable text of a text field as soon as the\\nuser has finished typing, the BTextControl accommodates you. Like other controls, a text field issues a message that will be received by the\\nMessageReceived() function of the control\\'s window. Such a message is sent\\nwhen the control determines that the user has finished entering text in the editable field, as indicated by a press of the Enter, Return, or Tab key or a mouse button click in the editable field of a different text field control. In all of these\\ninstances, the text that was previously in the editable field must have been modified in order for the control to send the message. If the user, say, clicks in an editable field of a text field, then presses the Enter key, no message will be sent.\\n\\nCreating a Text Field\\nThe BTextControl constructor has six parameters common to all controls, along\\nwith a text parameter that specifies a string that is to initially appear in the editable field of the text field control:\\nBTextControl(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*text,\\n*message,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nPassing a string in the text parameter of the BTextControl constructor is useful\\nif you want to alert the user that a default string or value is to be used in the event\\nthat the user doesn\\'t enter a string or value. If a value of NULL is passed as the\\ntext parameter, no text initially appears in the editable field.\\nAs with all control types, you must define a unique message constant that will be\\npaired with the control. To assist in keeping track of the text field control, you can\\noptionally include a data member in the window class in which the control is to\\nreside:\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_FIELD_MSG\\n\\n\\'txtf\\'\\n\\nclass MyWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\nBView\\n*fView;\\nBTextControl *fTextField;\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nTo create the control, pass the BTextControl constructor a boundary rectangle,\\nname, static text label, initial editable text, and a new BMessage object. Then add\\nthe new text field to the view the control will reside in:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Number of dependents:\", \"0\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nGetting and Setting the Text\\nAfter creating a text field control, your program can obtain or set the editable field\\ntext at any time. To obtain the text currently in the text field, invoke the\\nBTextControl member function Text(). Here, the text in a control is returned to\\nthe program and saved to a string named textFieldText:\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n\\nThe text that appears in the editable field of the control is initially set in the\\nBTextControl constructor, and is then edited by the user. The contents of the\\neditable field can also be set at any time by your program by invoking the\\nBTextControl member function SetText(). This routine overwrites the current\\ncontents of the editable field with the string that was passed to SetText(). Here\\nthe current contents of a control\\'s editable field are obtained and checked for\\nvalidity. If the user-entered string isn\\'t consistent with what\\'s expected, the string\\n\"Invalid Entry\" is written in place of the incorrect text the user entered:\\nchar\\nbool\\n\\n*textFieldText;\\ntextValid;\\n\\ntextFieldText = fTextField->Text();\\n...\\n// check for validity of user-entered text that\\'s now held in textFieldText\\n...\\nif (!textValid)\\nfTextField->SetText(\"Invalid Entry\");\\n\\nReproportioning the Static Text and Editable\\nText Areas\\nThe label parameter specifies the static text that is to appear to the left of the\\neditable field. If NULL is passed here, all of the control\\'s boundary rectangle (as\\ndefined by the frame parameter) is devoted to the text field. Any label string\\nother than NULL tells the constructor to devote half the width of the frame\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nrectangle to the static text label and the other half of this rectangle to the editable\\ntext area. Consider this snippet:\\nfTextField = new BTextControl(textFieldRect, \"TextField\",\\n\"Name:\", \"George Washington Carver\",\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_FIELD_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextField);\\n\\nIn this code, a text field control with a width of 200 pixels is created. By default,\\nthe static text field and the editable text field of the control each have a width that\\nis one-half of the control\\'s boundary rectangle, or 100 pixels. The result is shown\\nin the top window in Figure 6-12. Because the label is a short string, and because\\nthe value that might be entered in the editable text field may be a long string, it\\nwould make sense and be more aesthetically pleasing to change the proportions\\nof the two text areas. Instead of devoting 100 pixels to the static text label\\n\"Name:\", it would be better to give that text just, say, 35 pixels of the 200 pixels\\nthat make up the control\\'s width. Such reproportioning is possible using the\\nBTextControl member function SetDivider().\\n\\nFigure 6-12. The two areas of a text field control can be proportioned in different ways\\n\\nWhen passed a floating-point value, SetDivider() re-establishes the dividing\\npoint between the two text areas of a text field control. SetDivider() uses the\\nBTextControl object\\'s local coordinate system (meaning that the left edge of the\\ntext edit control has a value of 0.0, regardless of where the control is positioned in\\na window). The following addition to the above snippet changes the ratio to 35\\npixels for the static text field and 165 pixels for the editable text field. The bottom\\nwindow in Figure 6-12 shows the result. Notice that the placement and overall\\nwidth of the control are unaffected by the call to SetDivider().\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\nfloat\\n\\nxCoordinate = 35.0;\\n\\nfTextField->SetDivider(xCoordinate);\\n\\nText Field Example Project\\nThe TextField project demonstrates how to include a text field in a window, obtain\\nthat control\\'s user-entered string, and make use of that string elsewhere. When the\\nuser clicks the window\\'s button, the program gets the string from the text field and\\nuses that string as the new label for the push button. Figure 6-13 shows the program\\'s window after the button has been clicked.\\n\\nFigure 6-13. The window that results from running the TextField program\\n\\nPreparing the window class for the text field\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file is edited to include a control message constant\\nfor the window\\'s two controls.\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nTEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG\\n\\n\\'newT\\'\\n\\nTo keep track of the window\\'s views, the MyHelloWindow class now holds three\\ndata members:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\nBTextControl\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNewTitle;\\n\\x0cText Fields\\n\\n\\nCreating the text field\\nThe text field and button information are defined together just before the implementation of the MyHelloWindow constructor. The push button label will initially\\nbe \"Beep One\" and the text that will appear initially in the editable field of the text\\nfield control is the string \"Beep Me!\":\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\nconst\\n\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\nchar\\n\\n*textNewTitleName = \"TextTitle\";\\n*buttonBeep1Label = \"Beep One\";\\n*textNewTitleLabel = \"Enter New Button Name:\";\\n*textNewTitleText = \"Beep Me!\";\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor creates the window\\'s main view, then creates\\nand adds the button control and text field control to that view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_RESIZABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfTextNewTitle = new BTextControl(textNewTitleRect, textNewTitleName,\\ntextNewTitleLabel, textNewTitleText,\\nnew BMessage(TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fTextNewTitle);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a text field entry and a button click\\nA program can make use of a text field control in two ways. First, a window can\\nobtain the user-entered text from a text field control at any time--without regard\\nfor whether the text field has issued a message. Second, a window can await a\\nmessage sent by the text field and then respond. The MessageReceived() function demonstrates both these options.\\nWhen the window\\'s push button is clicked, the window receives a message from\\nthe button. At that time, the editable text of the text field control is retrieved and\\nused in a call to the button\\'s SetLabel() function. While the retrieving of the text\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nfield control\\'s editable text takes place in response to a message, that message is\\none issued by the push button--not the text field control.\\nWhen the user clicks in the text field, that control becomes the focus view. Recall\\nfrom Chapter 4 that a window can have only one focus view, and that view\\nbecomes the recipient of keystrokes. Once a text field is the focus view (as indicated by the editable text field being highlighted and the I-beam appearing in it),\\nand once that control\\'s editable text has been altered in any way, the control is\\ncapable of sending a message. That happens when the user presses the Return,\\nEnter, or Tab key. In response to a message sent by the text field control,\\nMessageReceived() resets the push button\\'s label to its initial title of \"Beep One\"\\n(as defined by the buttonBeep1Label constant):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nchar *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNewTitle->Text();\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEXT_NEW_TITLE_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMultiple Control Example Project\\nThe numerous example projects in this chapter demonstrated how to incorporate\\none, or perhaps two, types of controls in a window. Your real-world program\\nmight very well include numerous controls. ControlDemo is such a program--its\\none window holds the six controls shown in Figure 6-14.\\nTo use ControlDemo, enter a number in the range of 1 to 9 in the text field control, click a radio button control to choose one of three drawing colors, then click\\nthe Draw button. The ControlDemo program responds by drawing colored, overlapping circles. The number of circles drawn is determined by the value entered in\\nthe text field. Before drawing the circles, ControlDemo erases the drawing area--\\nso you can try as many combinations of circles and colors as you want. You can\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nFigure 6-14. The window that results from running the ControlDemo program\\n\\nalso click the Disable colors checkbox to disable the radio buttons and force drawing to take place in the last selected color.\\n\\nPreparing the Window Class for the Controls\\nThe program\\'s window holds six controls, so you can expect to see six application-defined message constants in the MyHelloWindow.h file:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_DRAW_MSG\\nRADIO_RED_MSG\\nRADIO_GREEN_MSG\\nRADIO_BLACK_MSG\\nTEXT_NUM_CIRCLES_MSG\\nCHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG\\n\\n\\'draw\\'\\n\\'rred\\'\\n\\'rgrn\\'\\n\\'rblk\\'\\n\\'crcl\\'\\n\\'setc\\'\\n\\nEach control is kept track of by a data member in the MyHelloWindow class.\\nThere\\'s also the familiar data member that exists to keep track of the window\\'s\\nmain view:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBTextControl\\nBCheckBox\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBRadioButton\\nBButton\\n};\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fTextNumCircles;\\n*fCheckBoxSetColor;\\n*fRadioRed;\\n*fRadioGreen;\\n*fRadioBlack;\\n*fButtonDraw;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nCreating the Controls\\nAll of the variables that are to be used as arguments to the control constructors are\\ndeclared together in MyHelloWindow.cpp. Each of the controls is then created in\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor. There are no surprises here--just use new with\\nthe appropriate control constructor and assign the resulting object to the proper\\nMyHelloWindow data member.\\nYou should be quite familiar with this process by now. To see the complete\\nMyHelloWindow constructor listing, refer to MyHelloWindow.cpp.\\n\\nHandling the Messages\\nAll application-defined control messages are handled in the body of the switch\\nstatement in MessageReceived(). The checkbox message is handled by first\\nchecking the control\\'s value, then disabling or enabling the three radio buttons as\\nappropriate:\\ncase CHECKBOX_SET_COLOR_MSG:\\ncheckBoxState = fCheckBoxSetColor->Value();\\nif (checkBoxState == B_CONTROL_ON) {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(false);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(false);\\n}\\nelse {\\nfRadioRed->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioGreen->SetEnabled(true);\\nfRadioBlack->SetEnabled(true);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nEach of the radio buttons does nothing more than set the high color to an RGB\\ncolor that matches the button\\'s label:\\ncase RADIO_RED_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_GREEN_MSG:\\nbreak;\\ncase RADIO_BLACK_MSG:\\nbreak;\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nClicking the Draw button results in a number of colored circles being drawn. Here\\nthe text field value is obtained to see how many circles to draw, and the high\\ncolor is used in the drawing of those circles. Before drawing the circles, any old\\ndrawing is erased by whiting out an area of the window that is at least as big as\\nthe drawing area:\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nnumCircles;\\ni;\\nBRect\\nBRect\\nconst char *textFieldText;\\ntextFieldText = fTextNumCircles->Text();\\nnumCircles = (int32)textFieldText[0] - 48;\\nif ((numCircles < 1) || (numCircles > 9))\\nnumCircles = 5;\\nfMyView->FillRect(areaRect, B_SOLID_LOW);\\nfor (i=1; i<=numCircles; i++) {\\nfMyView->StrokeEllipse(circleRect, B_SOLID_HIGH);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe text field message is completely ignored. The program obtains the editable\\ntext when the user clicks the Draw button. As written, the program checks the text\\nfield input to see if the user entered a numeric character in the range of 1 to 9. If\\nany other value (or character or string) has been entered, the program arbitrarily\\nsets the number of circles to draw to five. This is a less-than-perfect way of doing\\nthings in that it allows the user to enter an invalid value. One way to improve the\\nprogram would be to have the program react to a text field control message. That\\ntype of message is delivered to MessageReceived() when the user ends a typing session (that is, when the user clicks elsewhere, or presses the Enter, Return,\\nor Tab key). MessageReceived() could then check the user-entered value and, if\\ninvalid, set the editable text area to a valid value (and, perhaps, post a window\\nthat informs the user what has taken place).\\n\\nModifying the ControlDemo Project\\nWhat the program draws isn\\'t important to the demonstration of how to include a\\nnumber of controls in a window. With the graphics information found in Chapter 4\\nyou should be able to modify ControlDemo so that it draws something far more\\ninteresting. Begin by enlarging the window so that you have some working room.\\nIn the MyHelloWorld.cpp file, change the size of the BRect passed to the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 6: Controls and Messages\\n\\nMyHelloWindow constructor. Here I\\'m setting the window to have a width of 500\\npixels and a height of 300 pixels:\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n\\nLimiting drawing to only three colors isn\\'t a very user-friendly thing to do, so your\\nnext change might be to include a BColorControl object that lets the user\\nchoose any of the 256 system colors. The details of working with a color control\\nwere covered back in Chapter 5. Recall that you can easily support this type of\\ncontrol by first adding a BColorControl data member to the MyHelloWindow\\nclass:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nBColorControl\\n*fColorControl;\\n};\\n\\nThen, in the MyHelloWindow constructor, create the control and add it to the window. You\\'ll need to determine the appropriate coordinates for the BPoint and a\\nsuitable Be-defined constant for the color_control_layout in order to position\\nthe color control in the window you\\'re designing:\\nBPoint\\ncolor_control_layout\\nlong\\n\\nmatrix = B_CELLS_4x64;\\ncellSide = 16;\\n\\nfColorControl = new BColorControl(leftTop, matrix, cellSide, \"ColorControl\");\\nAddChild(fColorControl);\\n\\nFinally, when it comes time to draw, check to see which color the user has\\nselected from the color control. You can do that when the user clicks the Draw\\nbutton:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_DRAW_MSG:\\nrgb_color userColorChoice;\\nuserColorChoice = fColorControl->ValueAsColor();\\nSetHighColor(userColorChoice);\\n// now load up this section with plenty of graphics-drawing code\\nbreak;\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\n\\x0cMultiple Control Example Project\\n\\n\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nNow, review Chapter 4 to come up some ideas for drawing some really interesting graphics. Then add them under the BUTTON_DRAW_MSG case label in\\nMessageReceived()!\\n\\x0c\\nMenus\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Menu Basics\\n Working with Menus\\n Multiple Menus\\n Pop-up Menus\\n Submenus\\n\\n7.\\n\\nMenus are the interface between the user and the program, and are the primary\\nmeans by which a user carries out tasks. A Be program that makes use of menus\\nusually places a menubar along the top of the content area of each application\\nwindow--though it\\'s easy enough to instead specify that a menubar appear elsewhere in a window.\\nA menu is composed of menu items, and resides in a menubar. You\\'ll rely on the\\nBMenuBar, BMenu, and BMenuItem classes to create menubar, menu, and menu\\nitem objects. Early in this chapter, you\\'ll see how to create objects of these types\\nand how to interrelate them to form a functioning menubar. After these menubar\\nbasics are described, the chapter moves to specific menu-related tasks such as\\nchanging a menu item\\'s name during runtime and disabling a menu item or entire\\nmenu.\\nTo offer the user a number of related options, create a single menu that allows\\nonly one item to be marked. Such a menu is said to be in radio mode, and places\\na checkmark beside the name of the most recently selected item. If these related\\nitems all form a subcategory of a topic that is itself a menu item, consider creating\\na submenu. A submenu is a menu item that, when selected, reveals still another\\nmenu. Another type of menu that typically holds numerous related options is a\\npop-up menu. A pop-up menu exists outside of a menubar, so it can be placed\\nanywhere in a window. You\\'ll find all the details of how to put a menu into radio\\nmode, create a submenu, and create a pop-up menu in this chapter.\\n\\nMenu Basics\\nA Be application can optionally include a menubar within any of its windows, as\\nshown in Figure 7-1. In this figure, a document window belonging to the\\n\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nStyledEdit program includes a menubar that holds four menus. As shown in the\\nFont menu, a menu can include nested menus (submenus) within it.\\n\\nFigure 7-1. An application window can have its own menubar\\n\\nMenus can be accessed via the keyboard rather than the mouse. To make the\\nmenubar the focus of keyboard keystrokes, the user presses both the Command\\nand Escape keys. Once the menubar is the target of keystrokes, the left and right\\narrow keys can be used to drop, or display, a menu. Once displayed, items in a\\nmenu can be highlighted using the up and down arrow keys. The Enter key\\nselects a highlighted item.\\nA second means of navigating menus and choosing menu items from the keyboard is through the use of triggers. One character in each menu name and in\\neach menu item name is underlined. This trigger character is used to access a\\nmenu or menu item. After making the menubar the focus of the keyboard, pressing a menu\\'s trigger character drops that menu. Pressing the trigger character of an\\nitem in that menu selects that item.\\nThe topics of menubars, menus, and menu items are intertwined in such a way\\nthat moving immediately into a detailed examination of each in turn doesn\\'t make\\nsense. Instead, it makes more sense to conduct a general discussion of menu\\nbasics: creating menu item, menu, and menubar objects, adding menu item objects\\nto a menu object, and adding a menu object to a menubar. That\\'s what takes place\\non the next several pages. Included are a couple of example projects that include\\nthe code to add a simple menubar to a window. With knowledge of the interrelationship of the various menu elements, and a look at the code that implements a\\nfunctional menubar with menus, it will be appropriate to move on to studies of\\nthe individual menu-related elements.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nAdding a Menubar to a Window\\nThe menubar, menu, and menu item are represented by objects of type BMenuBar,\\nBMenu, and BMenuItem, respectively. To add these menu-related elements to your\\nprogram, carry out the following steps:\\n1. Create a BMenuBar object to hold any number of menus.\\n2. Add the BMenuBar object to the window that is to display the menu.\\n3. For each menu that is to appear in the menubar:\\na. Create a BMenu object to hold any number of menu items.\\nb. Add the BMenu object to the menubar that is to hold the menu.\\nc. Create a BMenuItem object for each menu item that is to appear in the\\nmenu.\\nA menubar must be created before a menu can be added to it, and a menu must\\nbe created before a menu item can be added to it. However, the attaching of a\\nmenubar to a window and the attaching of a menu to a menubar needn\\'t follow\\nthe order shown in the above list. For instance, a menubar, menu, and several\\nmenu items could all be created before the menu is added to a menubar.\\n\\nWhen an example project in this book makes use of a menubar, its\\ncode follows the order given in the above list. It\\'s worth noting that\\nyou will encounter programs that do things differently. Go ahead\\nand rearrange the menu-related code in the MyHelloWindow constructor code in this chapter\\'s first example project to prove that it\\ndoesn\\'t matter when menu-related objects are added to parent\\nobjects.\\n\\nCreating a menubar\\nThe menubar is created through a call to the BMenuBar constructor. This routine\\naccepts two arguments: a BRect that defines the size and location of the menubar,\\nand a name for what will be the new BMenuBar object. Here\\'s an example:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\nBRect\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nmenuBarRect;\\n*menuBar;\\n\\n\\nmenuBarRect = Bounds();\\nmenuBarRect.bottom = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT;\\nmenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nConvention dictates that a menubar appear along the top of a window\\'s content\\narea. Thus, the menubar\\'s top left corner will be at point (0.0, 0.0) in window\\ncoordinates. The bottom of the rectangle defines the menu\\'s height, which is typically 18 pixels. Because a window\\'s menubar runs across the width of the window--regardless of the size of the window--the rectangle\\'s right boundary can be\\nset to the current width of the window the menubar is to reside in. The call to the\\nBWindow member function Bounds() does that. After that, the bottom of the rectangle needs to be set to the height of the menu (by convention it\\'s 18 pixels).\\nCreating a menubar object doesn\\'t automatically associate that object with a particular window object. To do that, call the window\\'s BWindow member function\\nAddChild(). Typically a window\\'s menubar will be created and added to the\\nwindow from within the window\\'s constructor. Carrying on with the above snippet, in such a case the menubar addition would look like this:\\nAddChild(menuBar);\\n\\nCreating a menu\\nCreating a new menu involves nothing more than passing the menu\\'s name to the\\nBMenu constructor. For many types of objects, the object name is used strictly for\\n\"behind-the-scenes\" purposes, such as in obtaining a reference to the object. A\\nBMenu object\\'s name is also used for that purpose, but it has a second use as\\nwell--it becomes the menu name that is displayed in the menubar to which the\\nmenu eventually gets attached. Here\\'s an example:\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\n\\nBecause one thinks of a menubar as being the organizer of its menus, it may be\\ncounterintuitive that the BMenuBar class is derived from the BMenu class--but\\nindeed it is. A menubar object can thus make use of any BMenu member function,\\nincluding the AddItem() function. Just ahead you will see how a menu object\\ninvokes AddItem() to add a menu item to itself. Here you see how a menubar\\nobject invokes AddItem() to add a menu to itself:\\nmenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\n\\nCreating a menu item\\nEach item in a menu is an object of type BMenuItem. The BMenuItem constructor\\nrequires two arguments: the menu item name as it is to appear listed in a menu,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nand a BMessage object. Here\\'s how a menu item to be used as an Open item in a\\nFile menu might be created:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\n\\nAdd the menu item to an existing menu by invoking the menu object\\'s BMenu\\nmember function AddItem(). Here menu is the BMenu object created in the previous section:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nWhile the above method of creating a menu item and adding it to a menu in two\\nsteps is perfectly acceptable, the steps are typically carried out in a single action:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG)));\\n\\nHandling a Menu Item Selection\\nHandling a menu item selection is so similar to handling a control click that if you\\nknow one technique, you know the other. You\\'re fresh from seeing the control\\n(you either read Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, before this chapter, or you just\\njumped back and read it now, right?), so a comparison of menu item handling to\\ncontrol handling will serve well to cement in your mind the practice used in each\\ncase: message creation and message handling.\\nIn Chapter 6, you read that to create a control, such as a button, you define a message constant and then use new along with the control\\'s constructor to allocate\\nboth the object and the model message--as in this snippet that creates a standard\\npush button labeled \"OK\":\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_OK_MSG\\n\\n\\'btmg\\'\\n\\nBRect\\nBButton\\n\\n*buttonOK;\\n\\nbuttonOK = new BButton(buttonRect, \"OKButton\",\\n\"OK\", new BMessage(BUTTON_OK_MSG));\\n\\nMenu item creation is similar: define a message constant and then create a menu\\nitem object:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nAn application-defined message is sent from the Application Server to a window.\\nThe window receives the message in its MessageReceived() function. So the\\nrecipient window\\'s BWindow-derived class must override MessageReceived()--\\nas demonstrated in Chapter 6 and again here:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\n...\\n...\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe implementation of MessageReceived() defines the action that occurs in\\nresponse to each application-defined message. You saw several examples of this\\nin Chapter 6, including a few projects that simply used beep() to respond to a\\nmessage. Here\\'s how MessageReceived() would be set up for a menu item message represented by a constant named MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\n// open a file;\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMenubar Example Project\\nThe SimpleMenuBar project generates a window that includes a menubar like the\\none in Figure 7-2. Here you see that the window\\'s menubar extends across the\\nwidth of the window, as expected, and holds a menu with a single menu item in\\nit. Choosing the Beep Once item from the Audio menu sounds the system beep.\\n\\nFigure 7-2. The SimpleMenuBar program\\'s window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nPreparing the window class for a menubar\\nIf a window is to let a user choose items from a menubar, its BWindow-derived\\nclass must override MessageReceived(). Additionally, you may opt to keep track\\nof the window\\'s menubar by including a BMenuBar data member in the class. You\\ncan also include BMenu and BMenuItem data members in the class declaration, but\\nkeeping track of the menubar alone is generally sufficient. As demonstrated later\\nin this chapter, it\\'s a trivial task to find any menu or menu item and get a reference to it by way of a menubar reference. Here\\'s how the window class header\\nfile (the MyHelloWindow.h file for this project) is set up for menu item handling:\\n#define\\n\\n\\n\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBMenuBar\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the menubar, menu, and menu item\\nBy default, the height of a menubar will be 18 pixels (though the system will automatically alter the menubar height to accommodate a large font that\\'s used to display menu names). So we\\'ll document the purpose of this number by defining a\\nconstant:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\n\\nAfter the constant definition comes the MyHelloWindow constructor. In past examples, the first three lines of this routine created a view that occupies the entire content area of the new window. This latest version of the constructor uses the same\\nthree lines, but also inserts one new line after the call to OffsetTo():\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\n\\nThe frame is the BRect that defines the size and screen location of the new window. Calling the BRect function OffsetTo() with an argument of B_ORIGIN\\nredefines the values of this rectangle\\'s boundaries so that the rectangle remains the\\nsame overall size, but has a top left corner at window coordinate (0.0, 0.0). That\\'s\\nperfect for use when placing a new view in the window. Here, however, I want\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\nthe view\\nthat will\\nheight of\\nrectangle\\n\\n\\nto start not at the window\\'s top left origin, but just below the menubar\\nsoon be created. Bumping the top of the frame rectangle down the\\nthe menu, plus one more pixel to avoid an overlap, properly sets up the\\nfor use in creating the view.\\n\\nIf you work on a project that adds a view and a menubar to a window, and mouse clicks on the menubar\\'s menus are ignored, the\\nproblem most likely concerns the view. It\\'s crucial to reposition a\\nwindow\\'s view so that it lies below the area that will eventually hold\\nthe menubar. If the view occupies the area that the menubar will\\nappear in, the menubar\\'s menus may not respond to mouse clicks.\\n(Whether a menu does or doesn\\'t respond will depend on the order\\nin which the view and menubar are added to the window.) If the\\nview overlaps the menubar, mouse clicks may end up directed at the\\nview rather than the menubar.\\n\\nThe menubar is created by defining the bar\\'s boundary and then creating a new\\nBMenuBar object. A call to the BWindow function AddChild() attaches the\\nmenubar to the window:\\nBRect\\n\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nmenuBarRect = Bounds();\\nmenuBarRect.bottom = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT;\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\n\\nThe menubar\\'s one menu is created using the BMenu constructor. A call to the\\nBMenu function AddItem() attaches the menu to the existing menubar:\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\n\\nA new menu is initially devoid of menu items. Calling the BMenu function\\nAddItem() adds one item to the menu:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\n\\nSubsequent calls to AddItem() append new items to the existing ones. Because\\nthe menu item won\\'t be referenced later in the routine, and as a matter of convenience, the creation of the new menu item object is done within the call to\\nAddItem(). We could expand the calls with no difference in the result. For\\ninstance, the above line of code could be written as follows:\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(theItem);\\n\\nHere, in its entirety, is the MyHelloWindow constructor for the SimpleMenuBar\\nproject:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_BAR_HEIGHT\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a menu item selection\\nTo respond to the user\\'s menu selection, all I did on this project was copy the\\nMessageReceived() function that handled a click on a control in a Chapter 6\\nexample project. The simplicity of this code sharing is further proof that a menu\\nitem selection is handled just like a control:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nWindow resizing and views\\nThe SimpleMenuBar example introduces one topic that\\'s only partially related to\\nmenus: how the resizing of a window affects a view attached to that window. A\\ntitled or document window (a window whose constructor contains a third parameter value of either B_TITLED_WINDOW or B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW) is by default resizable. (Recall that a BWindow constructor fourth parameter of B_NOT_RESIZABLE\\ncan alter this behavior.) The SimpleMenuBar window is resizable, so the behavior\\nof the views within the window isn\\'t static.\\nLike anything you draw, a menubar is a type of view. When a window that displays a menubar is resized, the length of the menubar is automatically altered to\\noccupy the width of the window. This is a feature of the menubar, not your application-defined code.\\nUnlike a menubar, a BView-derived class needs to specify the resizing behavior of\\nan instance of the class. This is done by supplying the appropriate Be-defined constant in the resizingMode parameter (the third parameter) to the BView constructor. In past examples, the B_FOLLOW_ALL constant was used for the\\nresizingMode:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe B_FOLLOW_ALL constant sets the view to be resized in conjunction with any\\nresizing that takes place in the view\\'s parent. If the view\\'s parent is the window\\n(technically, the window\\'s top view) and the window is enlarged, the view will be\\nenlarged proportionally. Likewise, if the window size is reduced, the view size is\\nreduced. As a window is resized, it requires constant updating--so the Draw()\\nfunction of each view in the window is repeatedly invoked. This may not always\\nbe desirable, as the SimpleMenuBar example demonstrates. This program\\'s window is filled with a view of the class MyDrawView. In this project, the Draw()\\nfunction for the MyDrawView class draws a rectangle around the frame of the\\nview:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\n}\\n\\nIf the MyDrawView view has a resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL, the result of\\nenlarging a window will be a number of framed rectangles in the window--one\\nrectangle for each automatic call that\\'s been made to Draw(). Figure 7-3 illustrates this.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-3. A view\\'s resizing mode needs to be coordinated with window resizing\\n\\nThe SimpleMenuBar project avoids the above phenomenon by using the\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE constant for the resizingMode:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThis constant sets the view to remain a fixed size and at a fixed location in its parent--regardless of what changes take place in the parent\\'s size. Figure 7-4 shows\\nhow the view in the SimpleMenuBar project\\'s window looks when the program\\'s\\nwindow is enlarged.\\n\\nFigure 7-4. A fixed-size view is unaffected by window resizing\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nMenubar and Control Example Project\\nNow that you know how to add controls and menus to a window, there\\'s a strong\\nlikelihood that you may want to include both within the same window. The\\nMenuAndControl project demonstrates how to do this. As Figure 7-5 shows, the\\nMenuAndControl program\\'s window includes the same menubar that was introduced in the previous example (the SimpleMenuBar project). Sounding the system beep is accomplished by either choosing the one menu item or by clicking on\\nthe button. The view, which in this program doesn\\'t occupy the entire window\\ncontent area, remains empty throughout the running of the program. Here the\\nview is used to elaborate on last section\\'s discussion of window resizing and\\nviews. In this chapter\\'s TwoMenus project, the view displays one of two drawings.\\n\\nFigure 7-5. The MenuAndControl application window\\n\\nPreparing the window class for a menubar and control\\nBoth the push button control and the one menu item require the definition of a\\nmessage constant:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\nTo handle messages from both the push button and the menu item, override\\nMessageReceived(). Data members for the control and menubar appear in the\\nBWindow-derived class as well:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBButton\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fButtonBeep;\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nCreating the menu-related elements and the control\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor begins with the customary creation of a view for\\nthe window. Here, however, the view doesn\\'t occupy the entire content area of\\nthe window. Recall that the SimpleMenuBar project set up the view\\'s area like this:\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\n\\nThe MenuAndControl project instead sets up the view\\'s area as follows:\\n\\nFigure 7-5 shows that the resulting view occupies the right side of the program\\'s\\nwindow. Since a view in past examples occupied the entire content area of a window, items were added to the view in order to place them properly. For instance,\\nif the MyHelloWindow defined a BButton data member named fButtonBeep and\\na MyDrawView data member named fMyView, the addition of the button to the\\nwindow would look like this:\\nfMyView->AddChild(fButtonBeep);\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class declared in the MenuAndControl project does in fact\\ninclude the two data members shown in the above line of code. This project\\'s\\nMyHelloWindow constructor, however, adds the button directly to the window\\nrather than to the window\\'s view. A call to the BButton function MakeDefault()\\nserves to outline the button:\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\nfButtonBeep->MakeDefault(true);\\n\\nLooking back at Figure 7-5, you can see that in this project it wouldn\\'t make sense\\nto add the button to the window\\'s view. If I did that, the button would end up\\nbeing placed not on the left side of the window, but on the right side.\\nAfter adding the button to window, we create the menubar and add it to the window, create the menu and add it to the menubar, and create the menu item and\\nadd it to the menu. The menu-related code is identical to that used in the previous example (the SimpleMenuBar project). Note that there is no significance to my\\nplacing the control-related code before the menu-related code--the result is the\\nsame regardless of which component is added to the window first:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButtOnBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabEl, new BMessage(BUTTON_BEEP_MSG));\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\nfButtonBeep->MakeDefault(true);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nHandling a menu item selection and a control click\\nIt\\'s important to keep in mind that \"a message is a message\"--a window won\\'t distinguish between a message issued by a click on a control and a message generated by a menu item selection. So the same MessageReceived() function handles both message types:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nBecause a click on the Beep One button and a selection of the Beep Once menu\\nitem both result in the same action--a sounding of the system beep--I could have\\ndefined a single message constant. For instance, instead of defining both the\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG and the MENU_BEEP_1_MSG constants, I could have simply\\ndefined, say, a BEEP_MSG:\\n#define\\n\\nBEEP_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe One View Technique\\nNow you\\'ve seen numerous examples that establish one window-encompassing view, and one example that doesn\\'t. Which method should you use? Sorry,\\nbut the answer is an ambiguous \"It depends.\" It depends on whether your program will be making \"universal\" changes to a window, but it behooves you to\\nget in the habit of always including a window-filling view in each of your\\nBWindow-derived classes. If, much later in project development, you decide a\\nwindow needs to be capable of handling some all-encompassing change or\\nchanges, you can just issue appropriate calls to the view and keep changes to\\nyour project\\'s code to a minimum.\\nAs an example of a universal change to a window, consider a window that displays several controls and a couple of drawing areas. If for some reason all of\\nthese items need to be shifted within the window, it would make sense to have\\nall of the items attached to a view within the window rather than to the window itself. Then a call to the BView MoveBy() or MoveTo() member function\\neasily shifts the window\\'s one view, and its contents, within the window.\\nThe second reason to include a window-filling view--programmer\\'s preference--is related to the first reason. For each BWindow-derived class you define,\\nyou might prefer as a matter of habit to also define a BView-derived class:\\nclass MyFillView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n};\\n\\nIf you have no immediate plans for the view, simply implement the view class\\nmember functions as empty:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\n}\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\n}\\n\\n--Continued--\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nIn the window\\'s constructor, create and add a view. Then add all of the window\\'s controls and other views to this main view:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nfMyView = new MyFillView(frame, \"MyFillWindowView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButton = new BButton(buttonRect, buttonName,\\nbuttonLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_MSG));\\nfMyView->AddChild(fButton);\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nThe BButton constructor would then make use of this new message constant:\\nfButtonBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabel, new BMessage(BEEP_MSG));\\n\\nThe creation of the menu item makes use of this same message constant:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nA click on the button or a selection of the menu item would both result in the\\nsame type of message being sent to the window, so the MessageReceived()\\nfunction would now need only one case label:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BEEP_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThis scenario further demonstrates the notion that a window isn\\'t interested in the\\nsource of a message--it cares only about the type of the message (as defined by\\nthe message constant). That\\'s all well and good, but what\\'s the likelihood of a\\nreal-world application having a window that includes both a control and a menu\\nitem that produce the same action? Perhaps higher than you might guess. It\\'s a\\ncommon practice in many programs to include a control window (usually referred\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nto as a palette) that as a matter of convenience holds a number of buttons that\\nmimic the actions of commonly used menu items.\\nWindow resizing and the view hierarchy\\nThis chapter\\'s first example, the SimpleMenuBar project, illustrated how window\\nresizing affects a view. Including a control in the window of the MenuAndControl\\nproject provides an opportunity to illuminate resizing further.\\nA view created with a resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL is one that is resized\\nalong with its resized parent. A resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_NONE fixes a view in\\nits parent--even as the parent is resized. A view can also be kept fixed in size, but\\nmove within its parent. How it moves in relationship to the parent is dependent\\non which of the Be-defined constants B_FOLLOW_RIGHT, B_FOLLOW_LEFT, B_\\nFOLLOW_BOTTOM, or B_FOLLOW_TOP are used for the resizingMode. Each constant forces the view to keep its present distance from one parent view edge. Constants can also be used in combination with one another by using the OR operator (|). In the MenuAndControl project, the MyDrawView constructor combines B_\\nFOLLOW_RIGHT and B_FOLLOW_BOTTOM:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_RIGHT | B_FOLLOW_BOTTOM, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\nThe result of this pairing of constants is a view that remains fixed to the parent\\nview\\'s (the window here) right and bottom. In Figure 7-6, the MenuAndControl\\nwindow\\'s size has been reduced horizontally and increased vertically, yet you see\\nthat the view has kept its original margin of about ten pixels from the window\\'s\\nright side and about ten pixels from the window\\'s bottom edge.\\n\\nFigure 7-6. A view that keeps a constant-size right and bottom border in its parent\\n\\x0cMenu Basics\\n\\n\\nA complete description of all the resizingMode constants is found\\nin the BView section of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book.\\n\\nFigure 7-6 raises an interesting issue regarding the window\\'s view hierarchy. In the\\nfigure, you see that the view appears to be drawn behind the button. As of this\\nwriting, the view hierarchy determines the drawing order of the views in a\\nwindow. When a window requires updating, each view\\'s Draw() function is automatically invoked. The order in which the Draw() functions are called is first\\ndependent on the view hierarchy, starting from the window\\'s top view down to its\\nbottom views. For views on the same view hierarchy level, the order in which\\ntheir Draw() functions are invoked depends on the order in which the views were\\nadded, or attached, to their parent view. The first view added becomes the first\\nview redrawn. Such is the case with the BButton view and the MyDrawView. Each\\nwas added to the window, so these two views are at the same level of the view\\nhierarchy, just under the window\\'s top view. The MyDrawView was added first, so\\nit is updated first. After its Draw() function is called, the BButton Draw() routine\\nis called--thus giving the button the appearance of being in front of the\\nMyDrawView:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nfButtonBeep = new BButton(buttonBeepRect, buttonBeepName,\\nbuttonBeepLabel, new BMessage(BUTTON_BEEP_MSG));\\nAddChild(fButtonBeep);\\n...\\n...\\n}\\n\\nIf the order of the two calls to AddChild() were switched, you would expect the\\nbutton to be redrawn first, and the MyDrawView to be updated next. Give it a try\\nby editing the MyHelloWindow.cpp file of the MenuAndControl project. When you\\ndo that, you\\'ll see that running the program and shrinking the window results in\\nthe MyDrawView obscuring the button.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nNotice that the discussion of view updating order starts of with \"As\\nof this writing...\". There is no guarantee that this order based on\\nview hierarchy will always be in effect. In short, don\\'t make assumptions about view updating order. Instead, make an effort not to overlap views.\\n\\nWorking with Menus\\nYour program can get by with simple, static menus and menu items--but why\\nstop there? The menubar, menus, and menu items of a program should reflect the\\ncurrent state of a program. You can make sure they do that by implementing\\nmenus so that they give the user visual cues as to what is being done, and what\\ncan and can\\'t be done. For instance, a menu item can be marked with a checkmark to let the user know the item is currently in force. Or a menu item\\'s name\\ncan be changed, if appropriate, to what is currently taking place in the program. A\\nmenu item--or an entire menu--can be disabled to prevent the user from attempting to perform some action that doesn\\'t make sense at that point in the program is\\nat. These and other menu-altering techniques are covered in this section.\\n\\nCreating a Menu Item\\nEach menu item in a menu is an object based on the BMenuItem class. Menu item\\nobjects were introduced earlier in this chapter--here they\\'re studied in much\\ngreater detail.\\nThe BMenuItem class\\nA menu item is created using the BMenuItem constructor, the prototype of which\\nis shown here:\\nBMenuItem(const char\\nBMessage\\nchar\\n\\n*label,\\n*message,\\nshortcut = 0,\\nmodifiers = 0)\\n\\nThe first BMenuItem parameter, label, assigns the item its name, which is displayed as the item\\'s label when the user pulls down the menu in which the item\\nappears.\\nThe message parameter assigns a message of a particular type to the menu item.\\nWhen the user chooses the item, the message is delivered to the window\\nthat holds the menubar containing the menu item. That window\\'s\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nMessageReceived() function becomes responsible for carrying out the action\\nassociated with the menu item.\\nThe third BMenuItem constructor parameter, shortcut, is optional. The default\\nvalue used by the constructor is 0, but if a character is passed, that character\\nbecomes the menu item\\'s keyboard shortcut. When the user presses the shortcut\\nkey in conjunction with a modifier key, the menu item is considered selected--just\\nas if the user chose it from the menu. The fourth parameter, modifiers, specifies\\nwhat key is considered the modifier key. A keyboard shortcut must include the\\nCommand key (which by default is the Alt key on a PC and the Command key on\\na Macintosh) as its modifier key, but it can also require that one or more other\\nmodifier keys be pressed in order to activate the keyboard shortcut. Any of the Bedefined modifier key constants, including B_COMMAND_KEY, B_SHIFT_KEY,\\nB_OPTION_KEY, and B_CONTROL, can be used as the modifiers parameter. For\\ninstance, to designate that a key combination of Command-Q represent a means of\\nactivating a Quit menu item, pass \\'Q\\' as the shortcut parameter and B_COMMAND_\\nKEY as the modifiers parameter. To designate that a key combination of Alt-Shift-W\\n(on a PC) or Command-Shift-W (on a Mac) represents a means of closing all open\\nwindows, pass \\'W\\' as the shortcut parameter, and the ored constants\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY as the modifiers parameter.\\nCreating a BMenuItem object\\nA menu item is often created and added to a menu in one step by invoking the\\nBMenuItem constructor from right within the parameter list of a call to the BMenu\\nfunction AddItem():\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG)));\\n\\nAlternatively, a menu item can be created and then added to a menu in a separate\\nstep:\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nRegardless of the method used, to this point the BMenuItem constructor has been\\npassed only two arguments. To assign a keyboard shortcut to a menu item,\\ninclude arguments for the optional third and fourth parameters. Here a menu item\\nnamed \"Start\" is being given the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-S (with the\\nassumption that the slightly more intuitive keyboard shortcut Command-S is perhaps already being used for a \"Save\" menu item):\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Start\", new BMessage(START_MSG), \\'S\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY));\\n\\nIf a menu item is associated with a keyboard shortcut, and if that shortcut uses a\\nmodifier key, a symbol for that modifier key appears to the right of the menu item.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe symbol provides the user with an indication of what key should be pressed in\\nconjunction with the character key that follows the symbol. Figure 7-7 provides\\nseveral examples. In that figure, I\\'ve set up a menu with four items. The name I\\'ve\\ngiven each item reflects the modifier key or keys that need to be pressed in order\\nto select the item. For instance, the first menu item is selected by pressing Command-A. This next snippet provides the code necessary to set up the menu shown\\nin Figure 7-7:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command\", new BMessage(A_MSG), \\'A\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift\", new BMessage(B_MSG), \\'B\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift-Option\", new BMessage(C_MSG), \\'C\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY | B_OPTION_KEY));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command-Shift-Option-Control\",\\nnew BMessage(D_MSG), \\'D\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY |\\nB_OPTION_KEY | B_CONTROL_KEY));\\n\\nFigure 7-7. A menu that includes items that use several shortcut modifier keys\\n\\nAs illustrated in the preceding snippet and Figure 7-7, menu items are displayed in\\na menu in the order in which they were added to the BMenu object. To reposition\\nitems, simply rearrange the order of the calls to AddItem().\\nA separator is a special menu item that is nothing more than an inactive gray line.\\nIt exists only to provide the user with a visual cue that some items in a menu are\\nlogically related, and are thus grouped together. To add a separator item, invoke\\nthe BMenu function AddSeparatorItem():\\nmenu->AddSeparatorItem();\\n\\nFigure 7-15, later in this chapter, includes a menu that has a separator item.\\n\\nAccessing a Menu Item\\nIf a program is to make a change to a menu item, it of course needs access to the\\nitem. That can be accomplished by storing either the BMenuItem object or the\\nBMenuBar object as a data member.\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nStoring a menu item in a data member\\nIf you need access to a menu item after it is created, just store it in a local variable:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nThis snippet creates a menu item and adds it to a menu--as several previous\\nexamples have done. Here, though, the menu item object created by the\\nBMenuItem constructor is assigned to the BMenuItem variable menuItem. Now the\\nproject has access to this one menu item in the form of the menuItem variable.\\nThis menu item access technique is of limited use. Access to a menu item may\\nneed to take place outside of the function which created the menu item. If that\\'s\\nthe case, a window class data member can be created to keep track of an item for\\nthe life of the window:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*fMenuItem;\\n\\n};\\n\\nNow, when the menu item is created, store a reference to it in the fMenuItem\\ndata member:\\nmenu->AddItem(fMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep\", new BMessage(BEEP_MSG)));\\n\\nUsing this technique for creating the menu item, the menu item can be accessed\\nfrom any member function of the window class.\\nStoring a menubar in a data member\\nIf several menu items are to be manipulated during the running of a program, it\\nmay make more sense to keep track of just the menubar rather than each individual menu item:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\nprivate:\\n...\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n\\n};\\n\\nIf the menubar can be referenced, the BMenu member function FindItem() can\\nbe used to access any menu item in any of its menus. Pass FindItem() a menu\\'s\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nlabel (the string that represents the menu item name that is displayed to the user),\\nand the function returns that menu item\\'s BMenuItem object:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Beep\");\\n\\nMarking Menu Items\\nWhen selected, a menu item can be given a check mark to the left of the item\\nname. When selected again, this same menu item can become unchecked.\\nFigure 7-8 shows a menu with two marked items.\\n\\nFigure 7-8. A menu with marked, or checked, menu items\\n\\nMarking a menu item\\nTo mark or unmark a menu item, invoke the item\\'s BMenuItem function\\nSetMarked(). Passing this function a value of true marks the item, while passing a value of false unmarks it. Attempting to mark an already marked item or\\nunmark an already unmarked item has no effect. This next snippet sets up the\\nWindows menu items shown in Figure 7-8. Assume that data members exist to\\nkeep track of each of the three Windows menu items, and that the menubar and\\nmenu have already been created:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\nmenu->AddItem(fLockWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Lock Control Window\",\\nnew BMessage(LOCK_WIND_MSG)));\\nfLockWindMenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->AddItem(fResizeWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Allow Window Resizing\",\\nnew BMessage(RESIZE_WIND_MSG)));\\nfResizeWindMenuItem ->SetMarked(true)\\nmenu->AddItem(fMultipleWindMenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Allow Multiple Windows\",\\nnew BMessage(MULTIPLE_WIND_MSG)));\\n\\nIf a menu item is to be initially marked (as the Lock Control Window and Allow\\nWindow Resizing items are in the above snippet), save a reference to the item\\nwhen creating it. Then use that BMenuItem object to mark the item.\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nTo find out whether a menu item is marked, call the BMenuItem function\\nIsMarked(). For instance, after the user selects a menu item, call IsMarked() to\\ndetermine whether to pass SetMarked() a value of true or false and thus toggle the menu\\'s mark. The updating of an item\\'s mark can take place in the\\nMessageReceived() function, as shown here for the first menu item from the\\nWindows menu of Figure 7-8:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase LOCK_WIND_MSG:\\nBMenuItem *theItem;\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Lock Control Window\");\\nif (theItem->IsMarked()) {\\ntheItem->SetMarked(false);\\n// code to unlock a window (allow user to move it)\\n}\\nelse {\\ntheItem->SetMarked(true);\\n// code to lock a window (prevent user from moving it)\\n}\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMarking a menu item in a menu of related items\\nA menu may treat all of its items as related options, with the intent of allowing\\nonly one item to be in force at any time. The Audio menu in Figure 7-9 provides\\nan example of such a menu. Here the user is expected to choose one of the two\\nbeeping options. A subsequent click on the Beep button sounds the system beep\\neither once or twice, depending on the currently selected menu item.\\n\\nFigure 7-9. A menu with related options\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nIf all of the items in a menu are to act as a single set of options, you can set up\\nthe menu to automatically handle the checking and unchecking of its items. The\\nBMenu function SetRadioMode() instructs a menu to allow only one of its items\\nto be marked at any time. Additionally, setting a menu to radio mode provides the\\nmenu with the power to automatically mark whatever item the user chooses, and\\nto unmark the previously selected item. To set a menu to radio mode, pass\\nSetRadioMode() a value of true. This next snippet sets up the Audio menu pictured in Figure 7-9, marks the Beep Twice item, and sets the Audio menu to radio\\nmode:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\",\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\n\\nWhile a menu in radio mode will properly update its item mark in response to\\nmenu item selections, it is your responsibility to check which item is to be initially\\nmarked. As shown above, that\\'s accomplished via a call to SetMarked(). If a\\nmenu item is checked, your code should also make sure that the feature or option\\nto be set is in fact set.\\nThe BMenu function FindMarked() returns the menu item object of the currently\\nmarked item in a menu. When a menu is in radio mode, only one item can be\\nmarked at any time. In the next snippet, the Audio menu shown in Figure 7-9 is\\nkept track of by a BMenu data member named fAudioMenu. Calling\\nFindMarked() on this item returns the BMenuItem object of the currently marked\\nitem:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fAudioMenu->FindMarked();\\n\\nFindMarked() can be used on a menu that isn\\'t set to radio mode, too--but its\\nusefulness is then diminished because there may be more than one item marked.\\nIf more than one item is marked, FindMarked() returns a reference to the first\\nmarked item encountered (it starts at the first item in a menu and moves down).\\n\\nChanging a Menu Item\\'s Label\\nA menu item\\'s label can be changed at any time. To do that, gain access to the\\nmenu item and then invoke the BMenuItem function SetLabel(). In the next\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nsnippet, a menu item named \"Start Simulation\" is being renamed to \"Stop Simulation.\"\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Stop Simulation\");\\n\\nTo find out the current label of a menu item, call the BMenuItem function\\nLabel(). A call to this routine can be made prior to a call to SetLabel() to\\ndetermine the item\\'s current label before changing it to a new string. The type of\\nlabel-changing shown in the above snippet is a good candidate for the use of both\\nLabel() and SetLabel(). If the user starts some sort of action by choosing a\\nmenu item, that menu item\\'s label might change in order to provide the user with\\na means of stopping the action. The MessageReceived() function holds the\\nlabel-changing code:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_SIMULATION_RUN_MSG:\\nconst char *menuItemLabel;\\nmenuItemLabel = fSimMenuItem->Label();\\nif ((strcmp(menuItemLabel, \"Start Simulation\") == 0)) {\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Stop Simulation\");\\n// invoke application-defined routine to start simulation\\n}\\nelse {\\nfSimMenuItem->SetLabel(\"Start Simulation\");\\n// invoke application-defined routine to stop simulation\\n}\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThis snippet is the first in this book to make use of a standard C library function.\\nWhile the member functions of the classes of the BeOS take care of many of your\\nprogramming needs, they of course can\\'t account for every task your program is to\\nperform. Before writing an application-defined routine, don\\'t forget to fall back on\\nyour C and C++ background to select a standard library function where appropriate. Here I use the string comparison routine strcmp() to compare the characters\\nin a menu item\\'s label to the string \"Start Simulation.\" If the strings are identical,\\nstrcmp() returns a value of 0. In such a case, the menu item label needs to be\\nchanged to signal that the simulation is running and to allow the user to halt the\\naction. As shown in the two comments in the above code, whatever it is that is to\\nbe simulated is left as an exercise for the reader!\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nDisabling and Enabling Menus and Menu Items\\nWhen a menu is created, the menu and each of its items are all initially enabled.\\nThe entire menu--including the menu\\'s name in the menubar and all its items--or\\nany individual menu item can be disabled.\\nDisabling and enabling a menu item\\nA disabled menu item appears dim and is inactive--the user can see the item and\\nread its label, but can\\'t select it (releasing the mouse button while the cursor is\\nover the item has no effect). A menu item can be disabled or re-enabled by invoking the BMenuItem member function SetEnabled(). An argument of true\\nenables the item, while an argument of false disables the item. By default, a\\nmenu item is enabled upon creation. To disable a newly created menu item, call\\nSetEnabled() just after the menu item is created. Assuming that the menu\\'s window keeps track of its menubar in a data member named fMenuBar, the following snippet could be used to disable a menu item named \"Start\":\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Start\");\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nThe current state of a menu item can be found by invoking the item\\'s\\nIsEnabled() function. This routine returns a value of true if the item is presently enabled, false if it\\'s disabled.\\nIf the enabling or disabling of a menu item is to take place in response to a message (whether initiated by a different menu item selection or a control click),\\ninclude the menu item enabling/disabling code in MessageReceived(). Here a\\nmenu item named Advanced Options is enabled or disabled in response to an\\napplication-defined TOGGLE_OPTIONS_MSG message:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase TOGGLE_OPTIONS_MSG:\\nBMenuItem *theItem;\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Advanced Options\");\\nif (theItem->IsEnabled())\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\nelse\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(true);\\n...\\n...\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when SetEnabled() or IsEnabled() is invoked\\ndepends on the state of the menu the item resides in. If the menu\\nitself is disabled, attempting to enable an individual item in that\\nmenu will fail. Thus, even if your code hasn\\'t explicitly disabled a\\nspecific menu item, IsEnabled() could return a value of false for\\nthat item.\\n\\nDisabling and enabling a menu\\nWhen an entire menu is disabled, its name appears dim in the menubar. Clicking\\non the menu opens the menu and displays its items, but each of the items will be\\ndisabled. Now that you know of the BMenuItem() function SetEnabled(), it\\nshould come as no surprise that there is also a BMenu version of this routine. Passing a value of false to a menu object\\'s SetEnabled() function disables the\\nentire menu. If a program keeps track of an Audio menu in a BMenu data member\\nnamed fAudioMenu, you could disable that menu with just this line of code:\\nfAudioMenu->SetEnabled(false);\\n\\nThe current state of a menu can be found by invoking the item\\'s IsEnabled()\\nfunction. Like the BMenuItem version, the BMenu version of this routine returns a\\nvalue of true if the object is presently enabled.\\nA menu\\'s state usually changes in response to a message. If that\\'s the case, include\\nthe menu enabling or disabling code in MessageReceived().\\n\\nMenu and Menu Item Keyboard Access\\nMenu items can be accessed by the mouse, of course, but they can also be\\naccessed from the keyboard.\\nShortcut keys\\nThis chapter\\'s \"Creating a Menu Item\" section demonstrated how to assign a new\\nBMenuItem a keyboard shortcut. Here the third and fourth arguments to the\\nBMenuItem constructor set the new menu item to have a keyboard shortcut of\\nCommand-M:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Command\", new BMessage(A_MSG), \\'M\\',\\nB_COMMAND_KEY));\\n\\nIn most instances the above method works fine for establishing a keyboard shortcut. However, your program may want to assign a keyboard shortcut on the fly.\\nThis is particularly true if your program gives the user the power to modify menu\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nitem keyboard shortcuts. If an existing menu item doesn\\'t have a keyboard shortcut, or your program needs to change its currently defined keyboard shortcut,\\ninvoke the item\\'s SetShortcut() function. The two arguments to this routine are\\nidentical to the third and fourth arguments that can be passed to the BMenuItem\\nconstructor. Here the keyboard shortcut for an Open menu item is being set to\\nCommand-Shift-O:\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Open\");\\ntheItem->SetShortcut(\\'O\\', B_COMMAND_KEY | B_SHIFT_KEY)\\n\\nTo determine the current keyboard shortcut of a menu item, invoke the item\\'s\\nShortcut() function. Pass this function a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer\\nvariable. Shortcut() will fill this variable with a mask that consists of all of the\\nmodifier keys that are a part of the shortcut for the menu item. Shortcut() will\\nalso return the shortcut character for the menu item:\\nchar\\n\\n*shortcutModifiers;\\nshortcutChar;\\n\\nshortcutChar = theItem->Shortcut(shortcutModifiers);\\n\\nTo determine which modifier key or keys are a part of the shortcut, perform a bitwise AND on the uint32 parameter. In the next snippet, a menu item named Calculate is examined to determine its shortcut key. If the character returned by\\nShortcut() is null, the item has no shortcut key. If the menu item does have a\\nshortcut, the code goes on to determine which modifier keys are involved.\\nBecause all shortcut key combinations must include the Command key, no check\\nis made to see if that key is a modifier. The code does, however, check to see if\\nthe Shift or Option keys are included in the shortcut key combination:\\nBMenuItem\\nchar\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\n*theItem;\\n*shortcutModifiers;\\nshortcutChar;\\nhasShortcut = true;\\nshiftKeyModifier = false;\\noptionKeyModifier = false;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Calculate\");\\nshortcutChar = theItem->Shortcut(shortcutModifiers);\\nif (shortcutChar == \\'\\\\0\\')\\n// menu item doesn\\'t have a shortcut key\\nhasShortcut = false;\\nelse {\\n// menu item has a shortcut key\\nif (*shortcutModifiers & B_SHIFT_KEY)\\nshiftKeyModifier = true;\\nif (*shortcutModifiers & B_OPTION_KEY)\\noptionKeyModifier = true;\\n}\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nKeyboard triggers\\nA menu item can optionally be supplied with a shortcut key to benefit users who\\nprefer the keyboard over the mouse. But every menu item is supplied with a trigger for the same reason. A trigger is a single character the user types in order to\\nselect a menu item. A trigger differs from a shortcut key in two ways. First, the\\ntrigger doesn\\'t involve the use of a modifier key--simply pressing the trigger key\\nis enough to choose the menu item. The second difference is that the trigger\\nworks only when the menu that holds the item in question is open, or dropped.\\nOnce a menu is open onscreen, the user can simply press a trigger key to select\\nan item.\\nThe trigger is one of the characters in the menu item name, and is indicated by\\nbeing underlined. Typically, the trigger is the first character of one of the words\\nthat make up the menu item\\'s name. Looking back at Figure 7-9 reveals two examples--there you see that the Audio menu\\'s two items, Beep Once and Beep Twice,\\nhave triggers of \"O\" and \"T,\" respectively.\\nBecause a trigger can be used only on an open menu, different menus in the same\\nmenubar can have items with the same trigger. A menu item\\'s trigger is assigned\\nto the item by the system, so your program doesn\\'t have to worry about which\\nitems end up with which triggers. If you do want responsibility for assigning a\\nmenu item a particular trigger, invoke that item\\'s SetTrigger() function. Simply\\npass SetTrigger() the character that is to serve as the new trigger. Here a menu\\nitem named Jump is given a trigger of \"u\":\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Jump\");\\ntheItem->SetTrigger(\\'u\\');\\n\\nThe character you pass to SetTrigger() must be either the menu item\\'s shortcut\\nkey or a character in the menu item name. Failing both of these, the item will not\\nbe given a trigger--and whatever character had previously been assigned to the\\nitem won\\'t be used either (so passing SetTrigger() an invalid character provides the exception to the rule that every menu item must have a trigger).\\nYou can verify that a call to SetTrigger() worked according to plan by invoking the item\\'s Trigger() function. Double-check to see if the above snippet\\nworks by following it with a call to Trigger():\\nchar\\n\\ntheTrigger;\\n\\ntheTrigger = theItem->Trigger();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nWith the exception of a menu item that\\'s been given a trigger via a\\ncall to SetTrigger(), the system doesn\\'t assign menu items triggers until runtime. That\\'s done to avoid duplication of triggers within\\na menu. For this reason, calling Trigger() on a menu item that\\nhasn\\'t been manually assigned a trigger (by your project invoking\\nthe item\\'s SetTrigger() function) serves little purpose--\\nTrigger() will simply return NULL in such cases.\\n\\nFigure 7-9 shows that the menu itself has a trigger--the \"A\" key serves as the trigger for the Audio menu. Like a menu item trigger, the system automatically assigns\\na trigger to a menu. Again like a menu item, your project can override the systemsupplied trigger character. To do that, invoke the BMenu version of SetTrigger()\\non a menu object. Here the Audio menu is created and its trigger set to \"U\":\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\n...\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->SetTrigger(\\'U\\');\\n// now add menu items to menu\\n\\nMenu Characteristics Example Projects\\nIn this chapter\\'s example projects folder you\\'ll find three projects that alter the\\ncharacteristics of menus: TwoItemMenu, DisableMenuItem, and FindItemByMark.\\nEach contains only a few lines of new code, so I\\'ll forego thorough code walkthroughs and describe each only briefly.\\nAdding and altering menu items example project\\nThe menu in each of this chapter\\'s previous example projects consisted of just a\\nsingle item. The TwoItemMenu project adds a second item. This project also adds\\na shortcut key to each item--Command-1 for the Beep Once item and Command-2\\nfor the Beep Twice item. Figure 7-10 shows that the system has assigned each item\\na trigger that is the same character as that used in the item\\'s shortcut key. Finally,\\nthe project demonstrates a menu set to radio mode--selecting one menu item\\nchecks that item and unchecks the other item.\\nMost of the code included in the TwoMenuItem project will be quite familiar to\\nyou. The code that\\'s pertinent to the menu item topics in this section comes from\\nthe MyHelloWindow constructor:\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\n...\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\n\\x0cWorking with Menus\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-10. Menu items with shortcut keys\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG),\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\n\\nMenu item disabling and enabling example project\\nThe DisableMenuItem project adds a few lines of code to the TwoMenuItem\\nproject to demonstrate how your program can toggle a menu item\\'s state based on\\na message sent by a control. Clicking on the Beep button disables the Beep Once\\nmenu item in the Audio menu. Clicking on the Beep button again enables the\\nsame item. This menu-related code is found in the MessageReceived() case section for the message issued by the button control:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\n// code to beep the appropriate number of times goes here\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*theItem;\\n\\ntheItem = fMenuBar->FindItem(\"Beep Once\");\\nif (theItem->IsEnabled())\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(false);\\nelse\\ntheItem->SetEnabled(true);\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nAccessing a menu item from a menu object\\nThe preceding two projects use a MyHelloWindow class data member named\\nfNumBeeps to keep track of how many times the system beep should sound in\\nresponse to a click on the Beep button. The FindItemByMark project omits this\\ndata member, and doesn\\'t keep track of which menu item is currently selected.\\nInstead, it waits until the user clicks the Beep button before determining which\\nmenu item is currently marked. Clicking the Beep button results in the issuing of a\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG that reaches the MessageReceived() function. Here the\\nBMenu member function FindMarked() is used to find the currently checked\\nmenu item. Once the item object is obtained, its place in the menu is found by\\ncalling the BMenu function IndexOf(). A menu\\'s items are indexed starting at 0,\\nso adding 1 to the value returned by IndexOf() provides the number of beeps to\\nplay. The following snippet is from the MessageReceived() function of the\\nproject\\'s MyHelloWindow class:\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\nbigtime_t microseconds = 1000000;\\ni;\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n// one second\\n\\n*theItem;\\nitemIndex;\\nnumBeeps;\\n\\ntheItem = fAudioMenu->FindMarked();\\nitemIndex = fAudioMenu->IndexOf(theItem);\\nnumBeeps = itemIndex + 1;\\nfor (i = 1; i <= numBeeps; i++)\\n{\\nbeep();\\nif (i != numBeeps)\\nsnooze(microseconds);\\n}\\nbreak;\\n\\nMultiple Menus\\nRather than jumping right into new topics, I\\'ll provide a bit of a transition by presenting an example that includes two menus in its menubar. The example isn\\'t\\nentirely gratuitous, though--much of its code will reappear in upcoming discus-\\n\\x0cMultiple Menus\\n\\n\\nsions. Figure 7-11 shows the window, and the new Visual menu that\\'s been added\\nto the existing Audio menu, for the TwoMenus program. Choosing Draw Circles\\nfrom the Visual menu draws a number of concentric circles in the window, while\\nDraw Squares draws, yes, a number of concentric squares!\\n\\nFigure 7-11. The TwoMenus application window\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow.h header file in the TwoMenus project defines five message\\nconstants--one for the window\\'s button and one for each of the four menu items.\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nBUTTON_BEEP_MSG\\nMENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG\\nMENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG\\n\\n\\'beep\\'\\n\\'circ\\'\\n\\'squa\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class holds four data members. fMyView is used for drawing\\nthe circles or squares, and fNumBeeps holds the number of times the system beep\\nis to be played when the Beep button is clicked. Once the button and menubar\\nare created, they aren\\'t accessed outside of the MyHelloWindow constructor. Thus,\\nI could have declared BButton and BMenuBar variables local to that routine rather\\nthan making each a data member. However, I\\'ve opted to set the project up from\\nthe start with the assumption that it will grow in complexity well beyond this trivial version. If I later need to add features that alter either the button or menu items\\n(such as disabling and so forth), I\\'m all set.\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\nBButton\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n*fMyView;\\n*fButtonBeep;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\nBMenuBar\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\nfNumBeeps;\\n\\n};\\n\\nSome of the MyHelloWindow constructor code is familiar to you, so I won\\'t show\\nthe routine in its entirety. Here\\'s the constructor without the view and button\\ncode:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\n...\\nBMenu\\n*menu;\\nBMenuItem *menuItem;\\nBRect\\nmenuBarRect;\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Audio\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Beep Once\", new BMessage(MENU_BEEP_1_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Beep Twice\",\\nmenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Visual\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MessageReceived() routine handles each of the five types of messages the\\nwindow might receive. A selection of either of the items from the Visual menu\\nresults in the application-defined function SetViewPicture() being called, followed by a call to the BView routine Invalidate() to force the view to update.\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase BUTTON_BEEP_MSG:\\n// beep fNumBeeps times\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 1;\\n\\x0cMultiple Menus\\n\\n\\nbreak;\\nfNumBeeps = 2;\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_CIRCLES);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_SQUARES);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe drawing code could have been kept in the MessageReceived() function, but\\nI\\'ve decided to place it in a MyDrawView member function in order to keep\\nMessageReceived() streamlined. The SetViewPicture() function defines a\\nBPicture object based on the int32 argument passed to the routine. The value\\nof that argument is in turn based on the menu item selected by the user:\\nvoid MyDrawView::SetViewPicture(int32 pictureNum)\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nswitch (pictureNum)\\n{\\ncase PICTURE_SQUARES:\\nBeginPicture(fPicture);\\nfor (i = 0; i < 30; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\nbreak;\\ncase PICTURE_CIRCLES:\\nBeginPicture(fPicture);\\nfor (i = 0; i < 30; i++) {\\nStrokeEllipse(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe picture defined in SetViewPicture() is a new data member that\\'s been\\nadded to the MyDrawView class. Here you see the BPicture data member and the\\nnewly added declaration of the SetViewPicture() function:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nPICTURE_SQUARES\\nPICTURE_CIRCLES\\n\\n\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nvoid\\nprivate:\\nBPicture\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPicture;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe whole purpose of storing the circles or squares BPicture object in a\\nMyDrawView data member is so that the picture will be automatically updated\\nwhenever the view it\\'s drawn in needs updating. That\\'s accomplished by adding a\\ncall to the BView function DrawPicture() to the MyDrawView member function\\nDraw():\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nBRect frame = Bounds();\\nStrokeRect(frame);\\nDrawPicture(fPicture);\\n}\\n\\nPop-up Menus\\nA pop-up menu is a menu that exists within the content area of a window rather\\nthan within a menubar. The pop-up menu can be positioned anywhere in a window (or anywhere in a view in a window). Like a menu in a menubar, a pop-up\\nmenu\\'s content is displayed when the user clicks on the menu. Figure 7-12 shows\\na pop-up menu, both before and after being clicked, that holds two items.\\n\\nFigure 7-12. An example of a pop-up menu\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nA pop-up menu\\'s default state is radio mode--the most recently selected item in\\nthe menu appears checked when the menu pops up. Figure 7-12 illustrates this for\\na menu with two items in it. A pop-up menu is most often in radio mode, so such\\na menu should be used to hold a related set of options. If the menu is to hold\\nitems that aren\\'t directly related to one another, the menu should be housed\\nwithin a menubar rather than existing as a pop-up menu. A context-sensitive popup menu is an exception--it behaves like a normal menu, albeit one that is not\\ntied to a specific location in a window.\\n\\nThe BPopUpMenu Class\\nA pop-up menu is an object of the class BPopUpMenu. The BPopUpMenu class is\\nderived from a class you\\'ve already studied--the BMenu class. Here\\'s the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor:\\nBPopUpMenu(const char\\nbool\\nbool\\nmenu_layout\\n\\n*name,\\nradioMode = true,\\nlabelFromMarked = true,\\nlayout = B_ITEMS_IN_COLUMN)\\n\\nLike any menu, a pop-up menu has a name. The name is defined by the first\\nBPopUpMenu constructor parameter and is present on the pop-up menu when the\\nmenu initially appears in a window. This pop-up menu name, however, can be\\nchanged to reflect the user\\'s selection from the menu. The labelFromMarked\\nparameter determines if that is to be the case.\\nThe value of the radioMode parameter sets the pop-up menu\\'s radio mode setting. By default, radioMode has a value of true. A value of true here means the\\nsame as it does for any other menu: choosing one item checks that item and\\nunchecks whatever item was previously selected. The pop-up menu\\'s radio mode\\nvalue can be toggled by calling the BMenu function SetRadioMode().\\nIf the labelFromMarked parameter is set to true--as it is by default--the user\\'s\\nmenu item choice from the pop-up menu determines the name the pop-up menu\\ntakes on. The original name won\\'t reappear during the life of the window to\\nwhich the pop up is attached. In Figure 7-12, for instance, the pop-up menu\\'s\\nname is Visual. If the user chooses, say, the Draw Squares item, the pop-up\\nmenu\\'s name will change to Draw Squares. Setting labelFromMarked to true has\\nthe interesting side effect of automatically setting the pop-up menu to radio mode.\\nThat is, regardless of the value passed as the radioMode parameter of the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor, the menu will be set to radio mode. If\\nlabelFromMarked is false, the pop-up menu\\'s name will be fixed at its initial\\nname (as defined by the value passed in as the first parameter) and its radio mode\\nstate will be determined by the value of the radioMode parameter.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nThe last BPopUpMenu parameter defines the layout of the pop-up menu. By\\ndefault, a pop-up menu\\'s items appear in a column--just like a menu held in a\\nmenubar. To instead have the items appear in a row, replace the B_ITEMS_IN_\\nCOLUMN value with another Be-defined constant: B_ITEMS_IN_ROW.\\n\\nThe BMenuField Class\\nA pop-up menu won\\'t be placed in a menubar, so it doesn\\'t have to be added to a\\nBMenuBar object. A pop-up menu does, however, need to be added to an object\\ncapable of controlling the menu. The BMenuField class exists for this purpose.\\nWhen a BMenuField object is created, a BPopUpMenu object is associated with it.\\nHere\\'s the BMenuField constructor:\\nBMenuField(BRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\nBMenu\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\n*label,\\n*menu,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = B_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE)\\n\\nThe BMenuField is derived from the BView class. When a BMenuField object is\\ncreated, four of the six BMenuField constructor parameters (frame, name,\\nresizingMode, and flags) are passed on to the BView constructor.\\nThe frame is a rectangle that defines the size of the BMenuField, which includes\\nboth a label and a pop-up menu. In Figure 7-12, you saw an example of a\\nBMenuField object that has a label of \"Drawing:\" and a menu with the name\\n\"Visual.\" Recall that the source of the menu\\'s name is the name parameter of the\\nBPopUpMenu object. The BMenuField name parameter serves as a name for the\\nBMenuField view, and isn\\'t displayed onscreen. The resizingMode parameter\\nspecifies how the BMenuField is to be resized as its parent view is resized. The\\ndefault value of B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP means that the distance from\\nthe menu field\\'s left side and its parent\\'s parent\\'s left side will be fixed, as will the\\ndistance from the menu field\\'s top and its parent\\'s top. The flags parameter specifies the notification the menu field is to receive. The default flags value of\\nB_WILL_DRAW | B_NAVIGABLE means that the menu field view contains drawing, and should thus be subject to automatic updates, and that the menu field is\\ncapable of receiving and responding to keyboard input.\\nThe BMenuField label parameter defines an optional label for the menu field. If\\nyou pass a string here, that string is displayed to the left of the pop-up menu that\\nis a part of the menu field. To omit a label, pass NULL as the label parameter.\\nThe menu parameter specifies the pop-up menu that is to be controlled by the\\nmenu field. While the class specified is BMenu, it is most likely that you\\'ll pass a\\nBPopUpMenu object here (BPopUpMenu is derived from BMenu, so it can be used).\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nCreating a Pop-up Menu\\nTo create a pop-up menu, you first create a BPopUpMenu object, and then create a\\nBMenuField object. Three of the four BPopUpMenu constructor parameters have\\ndefault values, and those values generally suffice when creating a pop-up menu\\nobject--so creating the BPopUpMenu object often involves passing only a single\\nargument to the BPopUpMenu constructor. Here a BPopUpMenu object for a pop-up\\nmenu named \"Visual\" is being created:\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\n*popUpMenu;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Visual\");\\n\\nFor a \"regular\" menu--one that resides in a menubar--the next step would typically be to add the new menu object to the existing menubar object with a call to\\nAddItem(). A pop-up menu won\\'t be placed in a menubar, so the above step is\\nunnecessary. The pop-up menu does, however, need to be added to a menu field.\\nThe next steps are to create a BMenuField object that incorporates the\\nBPopUpMenu object and then add this new menu field to a view (or window):\\nBMenuField\\nBRect\\n\\n*menuField;\\n\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"VisualPopUp\", \"Drawing\",\\npopUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\n\\nThe third argument to the BMenuField constructor specifies that the menu field\\nhave a label of \"Drawing.\" In the previous snippet, the sole argument to the\\nBPopUpMenu constructor specified that the pop-up menu have the name \"Visual.\"\\nThe result of executing the above two snippets would be the menu field shown\\non the left side of Figure 7-12. The pop-up menu would be devoid of any items.\\nTo add a menu item to a pop up, have the pop-up menu invoke the BMenu function AddItem(). BPopUpMenu is derived from BMenu, and BPopUpMenu doesn\\'t\\noverride the BMenu version of AddItem()--so adding menu items to a pop-up\\nmenu is handled in the exact same way as adding menu items to a \"normal\" menu\\nthat resides in a menubar. Here two items are added to the pop-up menu that was\\njust created:\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\n\\nAt this point the menu field, and the pop-up menu that is a part of the menu field,\\nmatch those shown on the right of Figure 7-12.\\nOne reason the menu field label exists is to provide the user with information\\nregarding the purpose of the menu field\\'s pop-up menu. Once the user chooses\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nan item from the pop-up menu, the pop-up menu\\'s name disappears, so the menu\\nfield label may then be of help. If the contents of the pop-up menu make the popup menu\\'s purpose obvious, you may choose to forego the menu field label. To\\ndo that, simply pass NULL as the third argument to the BMenuField constructor.\\nCompare this BMenuField object creation with the one created a couple of snippets back:\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"VisualPopUp\", NULL, popUpMenu);\\n\\nThe left side of Figure 7-13 shows how the menu field looks now. The middle part\\nof the figure shows a menu item selection being made, while the right side of the\\nfigure shows how the menu field looks after choosing an item.\\n\\nFigure 7-13. A menu field before, during, and after a menu item selection\\n\\nYou\\'ll find the code that generates the window shown in Figure 7-13 in the\\nMenuAndPopup project. The code varies little from that shown in the coverage of\\nthis chapter\\'s TwoMenus project. But the MyHelloWindow constructors are different. The MenuAndPopup project uses the following code for adding a second\\nmenu to the menubar:\\nBMenuField\\nBPopUpMenu\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nconst char\\n\\n*menuField;\\n*popUpMenu;\\n*popUpName = \"VisualPopUp\";\\n*popUpLabel = NULL;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Visual\");\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, popUpName, popUpLabel, popUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\n\\x0cPop-up Menus\\n\\n\\nAltering the Label/Pop-up Menu Divider\\nWhile no physical vertical line divides a menu field\\'s label from its pop-up menu,\\nthere is indeed a defined boundary. By default, half of a menu field\\'s width is\\ndevoted to the label, and half is assigned to the menu. Consider this snippet:\\nBPopUpMenu\\n\\n*popUpMenu;\\n\\npopUpMenu = new BPopUpMenu(\"Click Here\");\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Small\", new BMessage(SML_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Medium\", new BMessage(MED_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Large\", new BMessage(LRG_MSG)));\\npopUpMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Extra Large\", new BMessage(XLG_MSG)));\\nBMenuField\\nBRect\\n\\n*menuField;\\n\\nmenuField = new BMenuField(popUpMenuRect, \"PopUp\", \"Size\", popUpMenu);\\nAddChild(menuField);\\n\\nThis code creates a pop-up menu and adds it to a menu field. The BMenuField\\nobject has a width of 120 pixels (150.0  30.0). Thus the menu field divider, which\\nis given in coordinates local to the menu field\\'s view, would be 60.0. As shown in\\nthe top two windows of Figure 7-14, this 1:1 ratio isn\\'t always appropriate. Here\\nthe menu field label \"Size\" requires much less space than the pop-up menu name\\nof \"Click Here.\" Because the pop-up menu is constrained to half the menu field\\nwidth, the pop-up name is automatically condensed--as is the \"Extra Large\" menu\\nitem after it is selected.\\nTo devote more or less of a menu field to either the label or pop-up menu, use\\nthe BMenuField function SetDivider(). Pass this routine a floating-point value\\nto be used as the new divider. This one argument should be expressed in coordinates local to the menu field. Consider our current example, which produces a\\nmenu field with a width of 120 pixels. To move the divider from its halfway point\\nof 60 pixels to 30 pixels from the left edge of the menu field, pass a value of 30.0\\nto SetDivider():\\n\\nThe bottom two windows in Figure 7-14 show how the menu field looks after\\nmoving its divider. The pop-up menu now starts 30 pixels from the left of the\\nmenu field--just a few pixels to the left of the \"Size\" label. The pop-up menu now\\nhas room to expand horizontally; rather than being limited to 60 pixels in width,\\nthe menu can now occupy up to 90 of the menu field\\'s 120 pixels.\\nYou could use trial and error to find the amount of room appropriate for your pop\\nup\\'s label. But of course you\\'ll instead rely on the BView function\\nStringWidth()--the BMenuField class is derived from the BView class, so any\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-14. A menu field with its default divider (top) and an adjusted divider (bottom)\\n\\nview member function can be invoked by a pop-up menu object. When passed a\\nstring, StringWidth() returns the number of pixels that string requires (based on\\nthe characteristics of the font currently used by the BMenuField object). For\\ninstance:\\n#define\\nfloat\\n\\nlabelWidth;\\n\\nlabelWidth = menuField->StringWidth(\"Size\");\\nmenuField->SetDivider(labelWidth + LABEL_MARGIN);\\n\\nThe above snippet determines the width of the string \"Size\" (the label used in the\\nprevious snippets), then uses that pixel width in setting the width of the space\\nused to hold the label. Because the label starts a few pixels in from the left edge\\nof the area reserved for the label, a few pixels are added as a margin, or buffer. If\\nthat wasn\\'t done, the divider would be placed somewhere on the last character in\\nthe label, cutting a part of it off.\\n\\nSubmenus\\nA menu item can act as a submenu, or hierarchical menu--a menu within a\\nmenu. To operate a submenu, the user simply clicks on the submenu name,\\nexposing a new menu of choices. To choose an item from the submenu, the user\\nkeeps the mouse button held down, slides the cursor onto the item, and releases\\nthe mouse button. Figure 7-15 provides an example of a submenu. Here a separator item and a submenu have been added to the Visual menu that was introduced\\nin this chapter\\'s TwoMenus project. The Number of Shapes submenu consists of\\nthree items: 10, 20, and 30.\\n\\x0cSubmenus\\n\\n\\nFigure 7-15. An example of a submenu\\n\\nCreating a Submenu\\nA submenu is nothing more than a BMenu object that is added to another BMenu\\nobject in place of a menu item. Consider an Animals menu that has five types of\\nanimals for its menu items: armadillo, duck, labrador, poodle, and shepherd.\\nBecause three of the five animal types fall into the same category--dogs--this\\nexample would be well served by grouping the three dog items into a submenu.\\nFigure 7-16 shows what the Animals menu would look like with a submenu, and\\nthis next snippet shows the code needed to produce this menu:\\nBMenu\\nBMenu\\n\\n*menu;\\n*subMenu;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Animals\");\\nmenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Armadillo\", new BMessage(ARMADILLO_MSG)));\\nsubMenu = new BMenu(\"Dogs\");\\nmenu->AddItem(subMenu);\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Labrador\", new BMessage(LAB_MSG)));\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Poodle\", new BMessage(POODLE_MSG)));\\nsubMenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Shepherd\", new BMessage(SHEPHERD_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Duck\", new BMessage(DUCK_MSG)));\\n\\nNotice in this snippet that while I\\'ve given the variable used to represent the submenu the name subMenu, it really is nothing more than a BMenu object. The items\\nin the Dogs submenu were added the same way as the items in the Animal\\nmenu--by invoking the BMenu member function AddItem().\\n\\nSubmenu Example Project\\nThe MenusAndSubmenus project builds an application that displays the window\\nshown back in Figure 7-15. Most of the code in this project comes from the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 7: Menus\\n\\nFigure 7-16. Categorizing things using a menu and submenu\\n\\nTwoMenus project, along with new code supporting the new submenu. The\\nMyHelloWindow class now holds a new int32 data member named fNumShapes\\nthat keeps track of the number of circles or squares that should be used when\\nDraw Circles or Draw Squares is selected:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\n...\\n...\\nprivate:\\nMyDrawView\\n*fMyView;\\nBButton\\n*fButtonBeep;\\nBMenuBar\\n*fMenuBar;\\nfNumBeeps;\\nfNumShapes;\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor includes new code that adds a separator item to\\nthe Visual menu and creates and initializes the Number of Shapes submenu that\\'s\\nnow housed as the last item in the Visual menu. Here\\'s a part of the\\nMyHelloWindow constructor:\\nBMenu\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*subMenu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n// create menubar and add to window\\n// create Audio menu, add to menubar, add items to it, set\\n// to radio mode and mark one item\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Visual\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Circles\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Draw Squares\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddSeparatorItem();\\nsubMenu = new BMenu(\"Number of Shapes\");\\nmenu->AddItem(subMenu);\\n\\x0cSubmenus\\n\\n\\nsubMenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"10\",\\nsubMenu->SetRadioMode(true);\\nmenuItem->SetMarked(true);\\nfNumShapes = 10;\\n\\nAs shown, a submenu can be set to radio mode, and an item in the submenu can\\nbe marked, just as is done for a menu that\\'s added to a menubar.\\nThe MessageReceived() function needs three new case sections--one to handle each of the three new messages that result from the submenu item selections:\\nfNumShapes = 10;\\nbreak;\\nfNumShapes = 20;\\nbreak;\\nfNumShapes = 30;\\nbreak;\\n\\nTwo of the existing case sections in MessageReceived() need modification.\\nNow the number of shapes to use in the drawing of the concentric circles or\\nsquares gets passed to the MyDrawView member function SetViewPicture():\\ncase MENU_DRAW_CIRCLES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_CIRCLES, fNumShapes);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\ncase MENU_DRAW_SQUARES_MSG:\\nfMyView->SetViewPicture(PICTURE_SQUARES, fNumShapes);\\nfMyView->Invalidate();\\nbreak;\\n\\nThe MyDrawView member function SetViewPicture() makes use of the new\\nparameter as the index that determines how many times InsetRect() and\\nStrokeRect() are called.\\n\\x0c\\nText\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n Fonts\\n Simple Text\\n Editable Text\\n Scrolling\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe BeOS makes it simple to display text in a view--you\\'ve seen several examples of calling the BView functions SetFont() and DrawString() to specify\\nwhich font a view should use and then draw a line of text. This approach works\\nfine for small amounts of plain text; your application, however, is more likely to\\nbe rich in both graphics and text--so you\\'ll want to take advantage of the BFont,\\nBStringView, BTextView, BScrollBar, and BScrollView classes.\\nThe BFont class creates objects that define the characteristics of fonts. You create\\na BFont object based on an existing font, then alter any of several characteristics.\\nThe BeOS is quite adept at manipulating fonts. You can alter basic font features\\nsuch as size and spacing, but you can also easily change other more esoteric font\\ncharacteristics such as shear and angle of rotation. You can use this new font in\\nsubsequent calls to DrawString(), or as the font in which text is displayed in\\nBStringView, BTextView, or BScrollView objects.\\nA BStringView object displays a line of text, as a call to the BView function\\nDrawString() does. Because the text of a BStringView exists as an object, this\\ntext knows how to update itself--something that the text produced by a call to\\nDrawString() doesn\\'t know how to do.\\nMore powerful than the BStringView class is the BTextView class. A BTextView\\nobject is used to display small or large amounts of editable text. The user can perform standard editing techniques (such as cut, copy, and paste) on the text of a\\nBTextView object. And the user (or the program itself) can alter the font or font\\ncolor of some or all of the text in such an object.\\nIf the text of a BTextView object extends beyond the content area of the object, a\\nscrollbar simplifies the user\\'s viewing. The BScrollBar class lets you add a scrollbar to a BTextView. Before adding that scrollbar, though, you should consider\\n\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\ncreating a BScrollView object. As its name implies, such an object has built-in\\nsupport for scrollbars. Create a BTextView object to hold the text, then create a\\nBScrollView object that names the text view object as the scroll view\\'s target. Or,\\nif you\\'d like to scroll graphics rather than text, name a BView object as the target\\nand then include a BPicture in that BView. While this chapter\\'s focus is on text,\\nit does close with an example adding scrollbars to a view that holds a picture.\\n\\nFonts\\nIn the BeOS API, the BFont class defines the characteristics of a font--its style,\\nsize, spacing, and so forth. While the BFont class has not been emphasized in\\nprior chapters, it has been used throughout this book. Every BView object (and\\nthus every BView-derived object) has a current font that affects text displayed in\\nthat view. In previous examples, the BView-derived MyDrawView class used its\\nAttachedToWindow() function to call a couple of BView functions to adjust the\\nview\\'s font: SetFont() to set the font, and SetFontSize() to set the font\\'s size:\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nA view\\'s current font is used in the display of characters drawn using the BView\\nfunction DrawString(). Setting a view\\'s font characteristics in the above fashion\\naffects text produced by calls to DrawString() in each MyDrawView object.\\nThe above snippet illustrates that the examples to this point have done little to\\nalter the look of a font. Making more elaborate modifications is an easy task. Later\\nin this chapter, you\\'ll use some of the following techniques on text displayed in\\ntext view objects--editable text objects based on the BTextView class.\\n\\nSystem Fonts\\nWhen designing the interface for your application, you\\'ll encounter instances\\nwhere you want a consistent look in displayed text. For example, your application may have a number of windows that include instructional text. In such a case,\\nyou\\'ll want the text to have the same look from window to window. To ensure\\nthat your application can easily do this, the BeOS defines three fonts guaranteed to\\nexist and remain constant for the running of your application.\\nThe three global system fonts\\nThe three constant fonts, or global system fonts, are BFont objects. When an application launches, these BFont objects are created, and three global pointers are\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nassigned to reference them. Table 8-1 shows these global BFont objects.\\nFigure 8-1 shows a window running on my machine; the figure includes a line of\\ntext written in each of the three system fonts.\\nTable 8-1. Global Fonts and Their Usage\\nBFont Global Pointer\\n\\nCommon Font Usage\\n\\nbe_plain_font\\n\\nControls, such as checkboxes and buttons, have their labels displayed in this font. Menu items also appear in this font.\\n\\nbe_bold_font\\n\\nWindow titles appear in this font.\\n\\nbe_fixed_font\\n\\nThis font is used for proportional, fixed-width characters.\\n\\nFigure 8-1. An example of text produced from the three global fonts\\n\\nContradictory as it sounds, the user can change the font that\\'s used for any of the\\nglobal system fonts. Figure 8-2 shows that the FontPanel preferences program lets\\nthe user pick a different plain, bold, or fixed font. This means that your application can\\'t count on a global font pointer (such as be_plain_font) always representing the same font on all users\\' machines. You can, however, count on a global font pointer to always represent only a single font on any given user\\'s\\nmachine--regardless of which font that is. So while you may not be able to anticipate what font the user will view when you make use of a global font pointer in\\nyour application, you are assured that the user will view the same font each time\\nthat global font pointer is used by your application.\\nUsing a global system font\\nYou\\'ve already seen how to specify one of the global fonts as the font to be used\\nby a particular view: just call the BView function SetFont() within one of the\\nview\\'s member functions. The AttachedToWindow() snippet that appears above\\nprovides an example. That method initializes all of the objects of a particular class\\nto use the same font. In the above example, all MyDrawView objects will initially\\ndisplay text in the font referenced by be_bold_font. For a particular view to have\\nits current font set to a different system font, have that view call SetFont() after\\nthe view has been created:\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-2. The FontPanel preferences application window\\nMyDrawView\\n\\n*theDrawView;\\n\\ntheDrawView = new MyDrawView(frameRect, \"MyDrawView\");\\ntheDrawView->SetFont(be_plain_font);\\n\\nWhile a BeOS machine may have more than the three system fonts installed, your\\napplication shouldn\\'t make any font-related assumptions. You can\\'t be sure every\\nuser has a non-system font your application uses; some users may experience\\nunpredictable results when running your application. If you want your program to\\ndisplay text that looks different from the global fonts (such as a very large font like\\n48 points), you can still use a global font to do so, as the next section illustrates.\\n\\nYour program shouldn\\'t force the user to have a particular nonsystem font on his or her machine, but it can give the user the\\noption of displaying text in a non-system font. Consider a word processor you\\'re developing. The default font should be be_plain_\\nfont. But your application could have a Font menu that allows for\\nthe display of text in any font on the user\\'s computer. Querying the\\nuser\\'s machine for available fonts is a topic covered in the BFont\\nsection of the Interface Kit chapter of the Be Book.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nGlobal fonts are not modifiable\\nA global font is an object defined to be constant, so it can\\'t be altered by an application. If a program could alter a global font, the look of text in other applications\\nwould be affected. Instead, programs work with copies of global fonts. While calling a BView function such as SetFontSize() may seem to be changing the size\\nof a font, it\\'s not. A call to SetFontSize() simply specifies the point size at\\nwhich to display characters. The font itself isn\\'t changed--the system simply calculates a new size for each character and displays text using these new sizes. Consider this snippet:\\nMyDrawView\\nMyDrawView\\n\\n\\ndrawView1->DrawString(\"This will be bold, 24 point text\");\\ndrawView2->DrawString(\"This will be bold, 12 point text\");\\n\\nThis code specifies that the MyDrawView object drawView1 use the be_bold_\\nfont in the display of characters. The code also sets this object to display these\\ncharacters in a 24-point size. The second MyDrawView object, drawView2, also\\nuses the be_bold_font. When drawing takes place in drawView1, it will be 24\\npoints in size. A call to DrawString() from drawView2 doesn\\'t result in 24-point\\ntext, though. That\\'s because the call to SetFontSize() didn\\'t alter the font be_\\nbold_font itself. Instead, it only marked the drawView2 object to use 24 points\\nas the size of text it draws.\\nMaking global fonts unmodifiable is a good thing, of course. Having a global font\\nremain static means that from the time your application launches until the time it\\nterminates, you can always rely on the font having the same look. Of course, there\\nwill be times when your application will want to display text in a look that varies\\nfrom that provided by any of the three global fonts. That\\'s the topic of the next\\nsection.\\n\\nAltering Font Characteristics\\nIf you want to display text in a look that doesn\\'t match one of the system fonts,\\nand you want to be able to easily reuse this custom look, create your own BFont\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nobject. Pass the BFont constructor one of the three global system fonts and the\\nconstructor will return a copy of it to your application:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\nThe BFont object theFont is a copy of the font referenced by be_bold_font, so\\ntheFont can be modified. To do that, invoke the BFont member function appropriate for the characteristic to change. For instance, to set the font\\'s size, call\\nSetSize():\\n\\nA look at the BFont class declaration in the Font.h BeOS API header file hints at\\nsome of the other modifications you can make to a BFont object. Here\\'s a partial\\nlisting of the BFont class:\\nclass BFont {\\npublic:\\nBFont();\\nBFont(const BFont &font);\\nBFont(const BFont *font);\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n...\\nvoid\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n...\\nfloat\\n...\\n\\nSetFamilyAndStyle(const font_family family,\\nconst font_style style);\\nSetSize(float size);\\nSetShear(float shear);\\nSetRotation(float rotation);\\nGetFamilyAndStyle(font_family *family, font_style *style)\\nconst;\\nFamilyAndStyle() const;\\nSize() const;\\nShear() const;\\nRotation() const;\\nSpacing() const;\\nEncoding() const;\\nFace() const;\\nStringWidth(const char *string) const;\\n\\n}\\n\\nFor each member function that sets a font trait, there is a corresponding member\\nfunction that returns the same trait. An examination of a few of these font characteristics provides a basis for understanding how fonts are manipulated.\\nFont size\\nAn example of setting a BFont object\\'s point size was shown above. An example\\nof determining the current point size of that same BFont object follows.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nfloat\\n\\ntheSize;\\n\\ntheSize = theFont.Size();\\n\\nYou\\'ve already seen that in order for a view to make use of a font, that font needs\\nto become the view\\'s current font. The BView function SetFont() performs that\\ntask. Numerous examples have demonstrated this routine\\'s use in setting a view\\'s\\nfont to one of the global system fonts, but you can use SetFont() with any\\nBFont object. Here, one view is having its font set to the global system font be_\\nplain_font, while another is having its font set to an application-defined BFont\\nobject:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\n\\nThis snippet demonstrates how to replace whatever font a view is currently using\\nwith another font--the drawView1 view was making use of some font before the\\ncall to SetFont(). There will be times when you won\\'t want to replace a view\\'s\\nfont, but rather simply alter one or more of the traits of the view\\'s current font. To\\ndo that, call the BView function GetFont() to first get a copy of the view\\'s current font. Make the necessary changes to this copy, then call SetFont() to make\\nit the view\\'s new current font. Here, a view\\'s current font has its size changed:\\nBFont\\n\\ntheFont;\\n\\ntheDrawView->GetFont(&theFont);\\ntheDrawView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFont shear\\nA font\\'s shear is the slope, or angle, at which the font\\'s characters are drawn. Pass\\nthe BFont function SetShear() a value in degrees and the routine will use it to\\nadjust the amount of slope characters have. The range of values SetShear()\\naccepts is 45.0 to 135.0. As Figure 8-3 shows, this angle is relative to the baseline\\non which characters are drawn. You\\'ll also note that the degrees are measured\\nclockwise. A value of 45.0 produces the maximum slant to the left, while a value\\nof 135.0 produces the maximum slant to the right. The following code generates\\nthe three strings shown in Figure 8-3:\\nBFont theFont(be_plain_font);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFigure 8-3. Output of text when the font\\'s shear is varied\\n\\nFont rotation\\nThe SetRotation() function in the BFont class makes it easy to draw text that\\'s\\nrotated to any degree. Pass SetRotation() a value in degrees, and subsequent\\ntext drawn to the view will be rotated. The degrees indicate how much the baseline on which text is drawn should be rotated. Figure 8-4 shows that the angle is\\nrelative to the original, horizontal baseline. Degrees are measured clockwise: a\\npositive rotation means that subsequent text will be drawn at an angle upward,\\nwhile a negative rotation means that text will be drawn at an angle downward.\\nThis next snippet produces the text shown in the window in Figure 8-4:\\nBFont theFont(be_plain_font);\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\ntheView->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nFigure 8-4. Output of text when the font\\'s rotation is varied\\n\\nFonts Example Project\\nThe FontSetting project demonstrates how to create BFont objects and use them\\nas a view\\'s current font. As Figure 8-5 shows, this example also demonstrates how\\nto set the angle at which text is drawn, as well as how to rotate text.\\n\\nFigure 8-5. The FontSetting example program\\'s window\\n\\nI won\\'t need a sophisticated program to show off a few of the things that can be\\ndone with fonts; a single menuless window will do. The FontSetting project\\'s\\nMyHelloWindow class has only one data member: the familiar drawing view\\nfMyView. The MyDrawView class has no data members. Both the MyDrawView\\n\\x0cFonts\\n\\n\\nconstructor and the MyDrawView function AttachedToWindow() are empty. The\\nonly noteworthy function is the MyDrawView routine Draw(), shown here:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nSetFont(be_plain_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point plain font\");\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point bold font\");\\nSetFont(be_fixed_font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point fixed font\");\\nBFont font;\\nGetFont(&font);\\nSetFont(&font);\\nDrawString(\"18 point 60 shear fixed font\");\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nGetFont(&font);\\nSetFont(&font);\\nDrawString(\"rotated\");\\n}\\n\\nThe code in Draw() falls into five sections, each section ending with a call to\\nDrawString(). Each of the first three sections:\\n\\n\\nSets the view\\'s font to one of the three system fonts\\n\\n\\n\\nSets the view to draw text in 18-point size\\n\\n\\n\\nMoves the pen to the starting location for drawing\\n\\n\\n\\nDraws a string\\n\\nTo draw each of the first three lines of text in 18-point size, note that after each\\ncall to SetFont(), SetFontSize() needs to be called. That\\'s because a call to\\nSetFont() uses all of the characteristics of the passed-in font. Thus, the second\\ncall to SetFont()--the call that sets the drawing view to draw in be_bold_\\nfont--sets the view to draw text in whatever point size the user defines for the\\nbe_bold_font (defined for the bold font in the FontPanel preferences window).\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe fourth code section demonstrates how to change one aspect of a view\\'s current font without affecting the font\\'s other attributes. A call to GetFont() returns a\\ncopy of the view\\'s current font. A call to the BFont function SetShear() alters\\nthe shear of the font. A call to SetFont() then establishes this font as the view\\'s\\nnew current font.\\nThe final section of code provides a second example of changing some characteristics of a view\\'s current font without overwriting all of its traits. Here the view\\'s\\nfont is set to be_bold_font, a copy is retrieved, and the size and rotation of the\\ncopied font are changed. This new font is then used as the view\\'s current font\\nbefore drawing the string \"rotated.\"\\n\\nSimple Text\\nThroughout this book you\\'ve seen that you can draw a string in any view by\\ninvoking the BView\\'s DrawString() function. DrawString() is a handy routine\\nbecause it\\'s easy to use--just call MovePenTo() or MovePenBy() to establish the\\nstarting point for a string, then pass DrawString() the text to draw. Drawing text\\nwith DrawString() has one distinct shortcoming, though. Unless the call is made\\nfrom within the view\\'s Draw() function, the text drawn by DrawString() won\\'t\\nautomatically be updated properly whenever all or part of the text comes back\\ninto view after being obscured. A call to DrawString() simply draws text--it\\ndoesn\\'t create a permanent association between the text and the view, and it\\ndoesn\\'t create any kind of string object with the power to update itself. The\\nBStringView class exists to overcome these deficiencies.\\nA BStringView object draws a single line of text, just as DrawString() does.\\nUnlike the DrawString() text, however, the BStringView object\\'s text automatically gets updated whenever necessary. While the text displayed by the\\nBStringView object can be changed during runtime (see the \"Setting the text in a\\nstring\" section ahead), it isn\\'t user-editable. It also doesn\\'t word-wrap, and it can\\'t\\nbe scrolled. That makes a BStringView object ideal for creating simple, static text\\nsuch as that used for a label, but undesirable for displaying large amounts of text\\nor user-editable text. For working with more sophisticated text objects, refer to the\\ndescription of the BTextView class in this chapter\\'s \"Editable Text\" section.\\n\\nThe BStringView Class\\nCreate a BStringView object by invoking the BStringView constructor. The\\nBStringView class is derived from the BView class. In creating a new string view\\nobject, the BStringView constructor passes all but its text parameter on to the\\nBView constructor:\\nBStringView(BRect frame,\\nconst char *name,\\n\\x0cSimple Text\\n\\nconst char *text,\\nuint32 resizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nuint32 flags = B_WILL_DRAW)\\n\\nThe frame parameter is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of the view. The\\ntext displayed by the BStringView object won\\'t word wrap within this rectangle,\\nso it must have a width sufficient to display the entire string. The name parameter\\ndefines a name by which the view can be identified at any time. The\\nresizingMode parameter specifies the behavior of the view in response to a\\nchange in the size of the string view\\'s parent view. The flags parameter is a\\nmask consisting of one or more Be-defined constants that determine the kinds of\\nnotifications the view is to respond to.\\nThe text parameter establishes the text initially displayed by the BStringView\\nobject. The text can be passed between quotes or, as shown below, a variable of\\ntype const char * can be used as the text argument. After creating the string\\nview object, call AddChild() to add the new object to a parent view:\\nBStringView\\nBRect\\nconst char\\n\\n*theString;\\n*theText = \"This string will be automatically updated\";\\n\\ntheString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\", theText);\\nAddChild(theString);\\n\\nFor simplicity, this snippet hardcodes the string view\\'s boundary. Alternatively,\\nyou could rely on the StringWidth() function to determine the pixel width of\\nthe string and then use that value in determining the coordinates of the view rectangle. In Chapter 7, Menus, this routine was introduced and discussed as a BView\\nmember function. Here you see that the BFont class also includes such a function. By default, a new BStringView object uses the be_plain_font (which is a\\nglobal BFont object), so that\\'s the object to use when invoking StringWidth().\\nHere, I\\'ve modified the preceding snippet to use this technique:\\n#define\\n\\nFRAME_LEFT\\n\\n\\nBStringView\\nBRect\\nconst char\\nfloat\\n\\n*theString;\\nstringFrame;\\n*theText = \"This string will be automatically updated\";\\ntextWidth;\\n\\ntextWidth = be_plain_font->StringWidth(theText);\\nstringFrame.Set(FRAME_LEFT, 10.0, FRAME_LEFT + textWidth, 30.0);\\ntheString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\", theText);\\nAddChild(theString);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nManipulating the Text in a String\\nOnce a string view object is created, its text can be altered using a variety of\\nBStringView member functions.\\nSetting the text in a string\\nThe text of a BStringView object isn\\'t directly editable by the user, but the program can change it. To do that, invoke the BStringView function SetText(),\\npassing the new text as the only parameter. In the following snippet, the text of\\nthe string view object created in the previous snippet is changed from \"This string\\nwill be automatically updated\" to \"Here\\'s the new text\":\\ntheString->SetText(\"Here\\'s the new text\");\\n\\nTo obtain the current text of a string view object, call the BStringView member\\nfunction Text():\\nconst char\\n\\n*stringViewText;\\n\\nstringViewText = theString->Text();\\n\\nAligning text in a string\\nBy default, the text of a BStringView object begins at the left border of the\\nobject\\'s frame rectangle. You can alter this behavior by invoking the BStringView\\nmember function SetAlignment(). This routine accepts one of three Be-defined\\nalignment constants: B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_ALIGN_RIGHT, or B_ALIGN_CENTER. Here\\nthe left-aligned default characteristic of the text of the BStringView object\\ntheString is altered such that it is now right-aligned:\\ntheString->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_RIGHT);\\n\\nYou can obtain the current alignment of a BStringView object\\'s text by invoking\\nthe BStringView function Alignment(). This routine returns a value of type\\nalignment. Unsurprisingly, the constants B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_ALIGN_RIGHT, and\\nB_ALIGN_CENTER are of this type, so you can compare the returned value to one\\nor more of these constants. Here, the alignment of the text in a BStringView\\nobject is checked to see if it is currently centered:\\nalignment\\n\\ntheAlignment;\\n\\ntheAlignment = theString->Alignment();\\nif (theAlignment == B_ALIGN_CENTER)\\n// you\\'re working with text that is centered\\n\\x0cSimple Text\\n\\n\\nChanging the look of the text in the string\\nA new BStringView object\\'s text is displayed in black and in the system plain\\nfont. A BStringView object is a BView object, so BView member functions such\\nas SetHighColor(), SetFont(), and SetFontSize() can be invoked to change\\nthe characteristics of a string view object\\'s text. Here, the color of the text of a\\nBStringView object is changed from black to red by altering the string view\\'s\\nhigh color. The text\\'s font and size are changed as well:\\ntheString->SetHighColor(redColor);\\ntheString->SetFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\nYou can make more sophisticated changes to the look of the text displayed in a\\nBStringView object by creating a BFont object, modifying any of the font\\'s characteristics (using the techniques shown in this chapter\\'s \"Fonts\" section), and then\\nusing that font as the BStringView object\\'s font. Here, the font currently used by\\na string view object is retrieved, its shear changed, and the altered font is again\\nused as the string view object\\'s font:\\nBFont theFont;\\ntheString->GetFont(&theFont);\\ntheString->SetFont(&theFont);\\n\\nString View Example Project\\nThe StringView project produces the window shown in Figure 8-6. The \"Here\\'s the\\nnew text\" string is a BStringView object, so the text is automatically redrawn\\nafter the user obscures the window and then reveals it again. The Text menu\\nholds a single item named Test that, when selected, does nothing more than generate a system beep. Subsequent examples in this chapter add to this menu.\\n\\nFigure 8-6. The StringView example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe BStringView object will be added to the window\\'s main view--the window\\'s one MyDrawView object. To make it easy for you to manipulate the string\\nlater in the program, I keep track of the string by making it a data member in the\\nMyDrawView class.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBStringView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fString;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe BStringView object\\'s frame rectangle has a left boundary of 10 pixels. The\\nBStringView object\\'s parent view is the window\\'s fMyView view. The width of\\nthe MyDrawView fMyView is the same as the window, so the default state for the\\nBStringView text has the text starting 10 pixels from the left edge of the window. Figure 8-6 makes it clear that this isn\\'t the starting point of the text. A call to\\nSetAlignment() is responsible for this discrepancy--the string view object\\'s text\\nhas been changed to right-aligned. The text\\'s look has been changed from its\\ndefault state by calling the BView functions SetFont() and SetFontSize(). You\\ncan\\'t tell from Figure 8-6 that the text appears in red rather than black. It\\'s a call to\\nSetHighColor() that makes this color change happen. Here\\'s the StringView\\nproject\\'s MyDrawView constructor, which shows all the pertinent code:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect\\nfString = new BStringView(stringFrame, \"MyString\",\\n\"This string will be automatically updated\");\\nAddChild(fString);\\nfString->SetText(\"Here\\'s the new text\");\\nfString->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_RIGHT);\\nfString->SetHighColor(redColor);\\nfString->SetFont(be_bold_font);\\n}\\n\\nEditable Text\\nA BStringView object is ideal for displaying a small amount of uneditable text.\\nWhen your application needs to display a larger amount of text that is usereditable, though, it\\'s time to switch to a BTextView object. A BTextView object\\nautomatically implements keyboard editing, and makes it easy to add menu edit-\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\ning. And while a text view object initially displays all its text in a single font and a\\nsingle color, you can easily alter the object to support multiple fonts and multiple\\ncolors--even within the same paragraph.\\n\\nThe BTextView Class\\nThe BTextView class used to create an editable text object is derived from the\\nBView class. So, as expected, several of the BTextView constructor parameters\\nwill be immediately familiar to you:\\nBTextView(BRect\\nconst char\\nBRect\\n\\nframe,\\n*name,\\ntextRect,\\nresizingMode,\\nflags)\\n\\nThe frame, name, and resizingMode parameters serve the same purposes as they\\ndo for the BView class. The flags parameter is made up of one or more Bedefined constants that determine the kinds of notifications the view is to respond\\nto. Regardless of which constant or constants you pass as the flags parameter,\\nthe BTextView constructor goes behind your back to add a couple more constants before forwarding flags to the BView constructor it invokes. These two\\nBTextView-added constants are B_FRAME_EVENTS, to allow the BTextView object\\nto reformat its text when it is resized, and B_PULSE_NEEDED, to allow the text\\ninsertion caret to blink properly.\\nThe one BTextView constructor parameter unique to the BTextView class is\\ntextRect. This rectangle specifies the boundaries for the text that will eventually\\nbe placed in the BTextView object.\\nBTextView frame and text rectangles\\nAt first glance, the purpose of the BTextView constructor\\'s textRect rectangle\\nmay seem to be redundant--the frame parameter is also a boundary-defining rectangle. Here\\'s the difference: the frame rectangle defines the size of the\\nBTextView object, as well as where the BTextView object resides in its parent\\nview. The textRect parameter defines the size of the text area within the\\nBTextView object, and where within the BTextView object this text area is to be\\nsituated. By default, a BTextView object has a frame the size of the frame rectangle drawn around it. The textRect rectangle doesn\\'t have a frame drawn around\\nit. Thus, the textRect rectangle provides for a buffer, or empty space, surrounding typed-in text and the BTextView object\\'s frame. Figure 8-7 illustrates this.\\nIn Figure 8-7, the dark-framed rectangle represents the frame rectangle, the first\\nparameter to the BTextView constructor. The light-framed rectangle represents the\\ntextRect rectangle. Neither of these rectangles would be visible to the user; I\\'ve\\nshown them in the figure only to make it obvious where their boundaries are in\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nFigure 8-7. A BTextView object consists of two rectangles\\n\\nthis particular example. The arrows would not be in the window either--I\\'ve\\nadded them to make it clear that the coordinates of the textBounds rectangle are\\nrelative to the viewFrame rectangle. Here\\'s the code that sets up a BTextView\\nobject like the one shown in Figure 8-7:\\nBTextView\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\n*theTextView;\\n\\ntheTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(theTextView);\\n\\nIn this snippet, the viewFrame rectangle defines the text view object frame to be\\n170 pixels wide by 80 pixels high. The textBounds rectangle specifies that the\\nfirst character typed into the text view object will have 20 pixels of white space\\nbetween the object\\'s left edge and the character and 20 pixels of white space\\nbetween the object\\'s top edge and the top of the character. The textBounds rectangle\\'s right boundary, 130, means there will be 40 pixels of white space between\\nthe end of a line of text and the text object\\'s right boundary (see Figure 8-7).\\nWhile I\\'ve discussed at length the BTextView constructor parameters, I\\'m compelled to elaborate just a bit more on the two rectangles. Figure 8-7 and the\\naccompanying code snippet exhibit a text object whose text area rectangle provides large and non-uniform borders between it and the text object itself. But it\\'s\\nmuch more typical to define a text area rectangle that has a small, uniform border. This example exaggerated the border size simply to make the relationship\\nbetween the two rectangles clear.\\nAnother point to be aware of is that the top and bottom coordinates of the text\\narea rectangle become unimportant as the user enters text that exceeds the size of\\nthe text area rectangle. The bottom coordinate of the text area rectangle is always\\nignored--the text view object will accept up to 32K of text and will automatically\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nscroll the text as the user types, always displaying the currently typed characters.\\nAnd as the text scrolls, the top coordinate of the text area rectangle becomes\\nmeaningless; the text view object will display the top line of scrolling text just a\\npixel or so away from the top of the text view object.\\nText view example project\\nThe TextView project displays a window like the one shown in Figure 8-8. To\\nmake the text view object\\'s boundaries clear, the program outlines the object with\\na line one pixel in width. As it did for the StringView project, the Text menu holds\\na single item named Test. Choosing this item simply generates a system beep.\\n\\nFigure 8-8. The TextView example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe text view object will be added to the window-filling MyDrawView, so I\\'ve\\nadded a BTextView data member to the MyDrawView class:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBTextView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe normally empty MyDrawView constructor now holds the code to create a\\nBTextView object. The viewFrame rectangle defines the size and placement of\\nthe text view object. This rectangle is declared outside of the MyDrawView constructor because, as you see ahead, it sees additional use in other MyDrawView\\nmember functions. The TEXT_INSET constant is used in establishing the boundaries of the text view object\\'s text area; that area will have a 3-pixel inset from\\neach side of the text view object itself:\\n#define\\nBRect\\n\\nTEXT_INSET\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\n}\\n\\nAfter using viewFrame to establish the size and placement of the text view object,\\nthis rectangle\\'s size is expanded by 2 pixels in each direction (recall from\\nChapter 5, Drawing, that a negative number as an argument to the BView member function InsetBy() moves the affected view\\'s frame outward in one direction). This is done in preparation for drawing a border around the text view area.\\nClicking on a text view object causes a blinking insertion point caret to appear in\\nthe text area of that object. The programmer can \"jump start,\" or force, this caret to\\nappear in a text view object by making the object the focus view. The final setup\\nwork for a MyDrawView object takes place in the AttachedToWindow() member\\nfunction, so that\\'s an appropriate enough place to make a call to the BView function MakeFocus():\\nvoid MyDrawView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\nfTextView->MakeFocus();\\n}\\n\\nThe AttachedToWindow() calls to SetFont() and SetFontSize()\\ndon\\'t affect the font used in the text view object. They\\'re called by\\nthe MyDrawView object, so they affect text drawn directly in such an\\nobject (there just doesn\\'t happen to be any text drawn in this example\\'s MyDrawView object). To change the font of a text view object,\\ninvoke the BTextView function SetFontAndColor() from the text\\nview object. Refer to \"Text Characteristics,\" in this chapter.\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor ended with the coordinates of the rectangle\\nviewFrame being enlarged a couple of pixels in each direction. This was done to\\ndefine a rectangle with boundaries just outside the boundaries of the text view\\nobject. When used as an argument to StrokeRect(), this rectangle provides a\\nframe for the text view object. I\\'ve placed the call to StrokeRect() in the\\nMyDrawView Draw() function so that this frame always gets appropriately\\nupdated:\\nvoid MyDrawView::Draw(BRect)\\n{\\nStrokeRect(viewFrame);\\n}\\n\\nYou might be tempted to try to surround a text view object with a frame by simply calling StrokeRect() from the text view object. This won\\'t work, because the\\ntext view object holds text, not graphics. Instead, draw the frame in the text view\\nobject\\'s parent view as I\\'ve done above. The fTextView object was added to the\\nMyDrawView object, so I draw the text view object\\'s border in the MyDrawView\\nobject.\\n\\nText Editing\\nBy default, the user can select and edit some or all of the text that appears in a\\ntext view object. BTextView member functions, along with several Be-defined\\nmessage constants, provide you with a great degree of control over the level of\\nediting you want to allow in each text view object in a window.\\nDefault text editing\\nRegardless of which editing menu items you choose to include or not include in\\nthe menubar of the text object object\\'s parent window, the following text editing\\nshortcut keys are automatically supported:\\n\\n\\nCommand-x: Cut\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-c: Copy\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-v: Paste\\n\\n\\n\\nCommand-a: Select All\\n\\nYou can verify that this notion of automatic text editing is true in practice by running the previous example program, TextView. Then type a few characters, select\\nsome or all of it, and press the Command and \"X\" keys. Even though the TextView project includes no text editing menu items and no text editing code, the\\nselected text will be cut.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nYou can deny the user the ability to edit text in the text view object by calling the\\nBTextView function MakeEditable(), passing a value of false:\\nfTextView->MakeEditable(false);\\n\\nAfter disabling text editing, you can again enable editing by calling\\nMakeEditable() with an argument of true. You can check the current editing\\nstate of a text object by calling IsEditable():\\nbool\\n\\ncanEdit;\\n\\ncanEdit = fTextView->IsEditable();\\n\\nIf you disable text editing for a text object, you may also want to disable text\\nselection. Like text editing, by default, text in a text object can be selected by\\nclicking and dragging the mouse. If you disable text editing, the user will be able\\nto select any number of characters in the text object. Since the user will be able to\\nselect and copy text, but won\\'t be able to paste copied text back into the view,\\nthis could lead to some confusion. To prevent the user from selecting text by\\ninvoking the BTextView member function MakeSelectable(), pass a value of\\nfalse as the sole argument:\\nfTextView->MakeSelectable(false);\\n\\nYou can enable text selection by again calling MakeSelectable(), this time with\\nan argument of true. You can check the current text selection state of a text view\\nobject by calling IsSelectable():\\nbool\\n\\ncanSelect;\\n\\ncanSelect = fTextView->IsSelectable();\\n\\nMenu items and text editing\\nUsers may not intuitively know that a text object automatically handles keyboard\\nshortcuts for copying, cutting, pasting, and selecting all of the object\\'s text. When\\nit comes time to perform text editing, the user will no doubt look in the menus of\\na window\\'s menubar for the basic editing menu items: the Cut, Copy, Paste, and\\nSelect All items. If you include one or more BTextView objects in a window of\\nyour program, you\\'d be wise to include these four menu items in an Edit menu.\\nAs you\\'ve seen, a BTextView object automatically provides shortcut key editing--\\nyou don\\'t need to write any code to enable the shortcut key combinations to\\nwork. The system also automatically supports menu item editing--menu item editing is easy to enable on a text view object, but you do need to write a little of\\nyour own code. While you don\\'t do any work to give a text view object shortcut\\nkey editing, you do need to do a little work to give that same object menu editing. All you need to do is build a menu with any or all of the four basic editing\\nitems. If you include the proper messages when creating the menu items, editing\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nwill be appropriately handled without any other application-defined code being\\npresent.\\nYou\\'re most familiar with the system message: a message that has a corresponding\\nhook function to which the system passes the message. A different type of message the system recognizes and reacts to is the standard message. A standard message is known to the system, and may be issued by the system, but it doesn\\'t have\\na hook function. Among the many standard messages the BeOS provides are four\\nfor editing, represented by the Be-defined constants B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE,\\nand B_SELECT_ALL. This brief definition of the standard message should tide you\\nover until Chapter 9, Messages and Threads, where this message type is described\\nin greater detail. The following snippet demonstrates how an Edit menu that holds\\na Cut menu item could be created. Assume that this code was lifted from the constructor of a BWindow-derived class constructor, and that a menubar referenced by\\na BMenuBar object named fMenuBar already exists:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Edit\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nRecall from Chapter 7 that the first parameter to the BMenuItem constructor,\\nlabel, specifies the new menu item\\'s label--the text the user sees in the menu.\\nThe second parameter, message, associates a message with the menu item. The\\nthird parameter, shortcut, assigns a shortcut key to the menu item. To let the\\nmenu item be responsible for cutting text, you must pass the Be-defined B_CUT\\nstandard message constant as shown above. The other required step is to set the\\ncurrently selected text view object as the destination of the message.\\nThe BInvoker class exists to allow objects to send a message to a BHandler\\nobject. The BMenuItem class is derived from the BInvoker class, so a menu item\\nobject can be invoked to send a message to a target. That\\'s exactly what happens\\nwhen the user selects a menu item. A window object is a type of BHandler (the\\nBWindow class is derived from BHandler), so it can be the target of a menu item\\nmessage. In fact, by default, the target of a menu item is the window that holds\\nthe menu item\\'s menubar. Typically, a menu item message is handled by the target window object\\'s MessageReceived() function, as has been demonstrated at\\nlength in Chapter 7. While having the window as the message recipient is often\\ndesirable, it isn\\'t a requirement. The BInvoker function SetTarget() can be\\ninvoked by a BInvoker object (such as a BMenuItem object) to set the message\\ntarget to any other BHandler object. The above snippet calls SetTarget() to set\\nthe active text view object to be the Cut menu item\\'s target.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe first parameter to SetTarget() is a BHandler object, while the second is a\\nBLooper object. Only one of these two parameters is ever used; the other is\\nalways passed a value of NULL. I\\'ll examine both possibilities next.\\nIf the target object is known at compile time, you can pass it as the first argument\\nand pass NULL as the second argument. If the window involved in the previous\\nsnippet had a single text view object referenced by an fMyText data member, the\\ncall to SetTarget() could look like this:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(fMyText, NULL);\\n\\nIf the window has more than one text view object, however, setting an editing\\nmenu item message to target one specific text view object isn\\'t desirable--selecting the menu item won\\'t have any effect on text that is selected in a text view\\nobject other than the one referenced by fMyText. The remedy in such a case is to\\ncall SetTarget() as shown here:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nWhen SetTarget() is called with a first argument of NULL, the second argument\\nis a BLooper object. Passing a looper object doesn\\'t set the looper object itself as\\nthe target--it sets the looper object\\'s preferred handler to be the target. An object\\'s\\npreferred handler is dependent on the object\\'s type, and can vary as the program\\nruns. If the above line of code appears in a BWindow-derived class constructor, the\\nthis argument represents the BWindow-derived object being created. In the case\\nof a BWindow-derived object, the preferred handler is whichever of the window\\'s\\nBHandler objects is the focus object when the window receives a message. For\\nediting, this makes perfect sense--you\\'ll want an editing operation such as the cutting of text to affect the text in the current text view object.\\n\\nEarlier I mentioned that the default target of a menu item message is\\nthe menu\\'s window. In the previous call to SetTarget(), the second argument is this, which is the menu\\'s window. If that makes it\\nseem like the call to SetTarget() is redundant, keep in mind that\\nthe object passed as the second argument to SetTarget() doesn\\'t\\nbecome the new target. Instead, that object\\'s preferred handler\\nbecomes the target.\\n\\nOther editing menu items are implemented in a manner similar to the Cut menu\\nitem. This next snippet adds Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All menu items to an Edit\\nmenu and, at the same time, provides a fully functional Edit menu that supports\\nediting operations in any number of text view objects:\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Edit\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Copy\", new BMessage(B_COPY), \\'C\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE), \\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nThe handling of an edit item comes from the standard message (such\\nas B_CUT) that you use for the message parameter in the invocation\\nof the BMenuItem constructor--not from the string (such as \"Cut\")\\nthat you use for the label parameter. While the user will be expecting to see the familiar Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All menu item\\nnames, you could just as well give these items the names Expunge,\\nMimic, Inject, and Elect Every. From a more practical standpoint, a\\nprogram designed for non-English speaking people can include\\nnative text in the edit menu.\\n\\nText editing menu item example project\\nThe TextViewEdit project is a modification of this chapter\\'s TextView project. As\\nshown in Figure 8-9, four menu items have been added to the already present Test\\nitem in the Text menu. For simplicity, I\\'ve added these four editing items to the\\nexisting Text menu, but your application should stick with convention and include\\nthese items in a menu titled Edit.\\n\\nFigure 8-9. The TextViewEdit example program\\'s window\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nFor this TextViewEdit project, the MyDrawView class and the implementation of\\nthe MyDrawView member functions are all unchanged from the TextView project:\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView class has a BTextView data member named fTextView.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor creates a BTextView object and assigns it to\\nfTextView.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachedToWindow() sets the focus view and sets up a rectangle to serve as\\na border for the text view object.\\n\\n\\n\\nDraw() draws the text view object\\'s border.\\n\\nThe modifications to the project are all found in the MyHelloWindow constructor.\\nHere, the four editing menu items are added to the already present Test menu\\nitem:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"Text\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Test\", new BMessage(TEST_MSG)));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Copy\", new BMessage(B_COPY),\\n\\'C\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE),\\n\\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow class includes a MessageReceived() member function that\\nhandles only the first menu item in the Test menu: the Text item. If\\nMessageReceived() receives a TEST_MSG message, a call to beep() is made.\\nThe system routes the other message types (B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_\\nSELECT_ALL) to the focus view (which in this example is the one text view object)\\nfor automatic handling by that view.\\n\\nText Characteristics\\nWhile the characteristics of the text displayed by a BStringView object can be\\naltered by invoking BView functions such as SetFont() and SetHighColor(),\\nthe characteristics of the text displayed by a BTextView object should be altered\\nby invoking member functions of the BTextView class. For instance, to change\\neither the color or font, or both, of a BTextView object\\'s text, invoke the\\nBTextView function SetFontAndColor().\\nGetting BTextView text characteristics\\nA new BTextView object\\'s text is displayed in black and in the system\\'s current\\nplain font. A BTextView object is a BView object, so you might expect that\\nchanges to the object\\'s text would be carried out by BView member functions such\\nas SetHighColor() and SetFont(). While this is in fact true, it\\'s important to\\nnote that the calls to these BView functions are made indirectly. That is, the\\nBTextView class provides its own set of graphics member functions that a\\nBTextView object should invoke in order to affect the object\\'s text. Each of these\\nBTextView functions in turn invokes whatever BView functions are needed in\\norder to carry out its specific task. The BTextView functions GetFontAndColor()\\nand SetFontAndColor() are of primary importance in changing the characteristics of text displayed in a text view object.\\nGetFontAndColor() is your means to accessing a text view object\\'s current font\\nso that you can alter its properties. Here\\'s the prototype:\\nvoid GetFontAndColor(BFont\\nrgb_color\\nbool\\n\\n*font,\\n*sameProperties,\\n*color = NULL,\\n*sameColor = NULL)\\n\\nGetFontAndColor() returns information about BTextView in its four parameters. After you call GetFontAndColor(), the font parameter holds a copy of the\\ntext view object\\'s font. The sameProperties parameter is a mask that specifies\\nwhich of a number of the text view object\\'s font properties apply to all of the\\ncharacters in the current selection. GetFontAndColor() combines a number of\\nBe-defined constants to create the mask. For instance, if all of the characters in the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nselected text are the same size, a test of the returned value of sameProperties\\nwill reveal that it includes the value of the Be-defined constant B_FONT_SIZE:\\n// invoke GetFontAndColor() here\\nif (sameProperties && B_FONT_SIZE)\\n// all characters are the same size\\n\\nIf no text is currently selected at the time of the call to\\nGetFontAndColor(), the sameProperties mask will be set such\\nthat all of the properties test true. This makes sense because all of\\nthe selected characters--all none of them--do indeed share the\\nsame properties!\\n\\nThe third parameter, color, specifies the RGB color in which the text view\\nobject\\'s text is to be displayed. The color returned in this parameter is that of the\\nfirst character in the selected text (or the character following the insertion point if\\nno text is currently selected). The sameColor parameter indicates whether or not\\nall of the selected text (or all characters if no text is currently selected) is of the\\ncolor returned by the color parameter.\\nIf your only interest is in the font of a text view object, the color and sameColor\\nparameters can be safely ignored--these two parameters have a default value of\\nNULL. Here\\'s an example:\\nBFont\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\nfTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\n\\nIf, instead, your only interest is in the color of a text view object\\'s text, pass NULL\\nas the font parameter:\\nrgb_color\\nbool\\n\\nsameProperties;\\ncolor;\\nsameColor;\\n\\nfTextView->GetFontAndColor(NULL, &sameProperties, &color, &sameColor);\\n\\nAlternatively, you can pass a variable for each of the four arguments, then simply\\nignore the returned values of the variables that aren\\'t of interest.\\nA call to GetFontAndColor() doesn\\'t affect a text view object\\'s text in any way--\\nit simply returns to your program information about the text. Once you\\'ve\\nobtained a font and color, you\\'ll want to make changes to one or the other, or\\nboth.\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nSetting BTextView text characteristics\\nAfter obtaining a copy of a BTextView object\\'s font, you can make any desired\\nchanges to the font and then pass these changes back to the text view object. The\\nsame applies to the text\\'s color. The BTextView function SetFontAndColor()\\ntakes care of both of these tasks:\\nvoid SetFontAndColor(const BFont\\nrgb_color\\n\\n*font,\\nproperties = B_FONT_ALL,\\n*color = NULL)\\n\\nThe font, properties, and color parameters are the variables filled in by a previous call to GetFontAndColor(). In between the calls to GetFontAndColor()\\nand SetFontAndColor(), invoke one or more BFont functions to change the\\ndesired font trait. For instance, to change the size of the font used to display the\\ntext of a BTextView object named theTextView, invoke the BFont function\\nSetSize() as shown in the following snippet. Note that because this snippet isn\\'t\\nintended to change the color of the text in the theTextView text view object, the\\ncall to GetFontAndColor() omits the color and sameColor parameters:\\nBFont\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\ntheTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL);\\n\\nIn this snippet, the BFont object font gets its value from GetFontAndColor(), is\\naltered by the call to SetSize(), and then is passed back to the theTextView\\nobject by a call to SetFontAndColor(). The process is not, however, the same\\nfor the sameProperties variable.\\nRecall that the GetFontAndColor() uint32 parameter sameProperties returns\\na mask that specifies which font properties apply to all of the characters in the\\ncurrent selection. The SetFontAndColor() uint32 parameter properties, on\\nthe other hand, is a mask that specifies which properties of the BFont parameter\\npassed to SetFontAndColor() should be used in the setting of the text view\\nobject\\'s font.\\nConsider the following example: your program declares a BFont variable named\\ntheBigFont and sets a variety of its properties (such as size, rotation, and shear),\\nbut you\\'d only like SetFontAndColor() to apply this font\\'s size property to a\\nview object\\'s font (perhaps your program has set other characteristics of\\ntheBigFont because it plans to use the font elsewhere as well). To do that, pass\\nthe Be-defined constant B_FONT_SIZE as the second argument to\\nSetFontAndColor():\\nBFont\\n\\ntheBigFont(be_plain_font);\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&theBigFont, B_FONT_SIZE);\\n\\nIn this snippet, you\\'ll note that there\\'s no call to GetFontAndColor(). Unlike previous snippets, this code doesn\\'t obtain a copy of the current font used by\\ntheTextView, alter it, and pass the font back to theTextView. Instead, it creates\\na new font based on the system font be_plain_font, changes some of that font\\'s\\ncharacteristics, then passes this font to SetFontAndColor(). The important point\\nto note is that passing B_FONT_SIZE as the second properties mask tells\\nSetFontAndColor() to leave all of the characteristics of the font currently used\\nby theTextView unchanged except for its size. The new size will be that of the\\nfirst parameter, theBigFont. The font control definitions such as B_FONT_SIZE\\nare located in the View.h header file.\\nTo change the color of a BTextView object\\'s text, assign an rgb_color variable\\nthe desired color and then pass that variable as the third parameter to\\nSetFontAndColor(). Here, the BTextView theTextView is set to display the\\ncharacters in the current selection in red:\\nBFont\\nrgb_color\\n\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\n\\ntheTextView->GetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\ntheTextView->SetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL, &redColor);\\n\\nAllowing multiple character formats in a BTextView\\nBy default, all of the text that is typed or pasted into a BTextView object shares\\nthe same characteristics. That is, it all appears in the same font, the same size, the\\nsame color, and so forth. If the object is left in this default state, user attempts to\\nchange the characteristics of some of the text will fail--all of the text in the object\\nwill take on whatever change is made to any selected text. To allow for multiple\\ncharacter formats in a single text view object, pass a value of true to the\\nBTextView function SetStylable().\\ntheTextView->SetStylable(true);\\n\\nTo reverse the setting and prevent multiple character formats in a text view object,\\npass SetStylable() a value of false. Note that in doing this any styles that\\nwere previously applied to characters in the text view will now be lost. To test a\\ntext view object\\'s ability to support multiple character formats, call the BTextView\\nfunction IsStylable():\\nbool\\n\\nsupportsMultipleStyles;\\n\\nsupportsMultipleStyles = theTextView->IsStylable();\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nChanging the background color in a BTextView\\nChanges to the characteristics of text in a BTextView object are achieved by using\\na number of BFont functions in conjunction with the BTextView functions\\nGetFontAndColor() and SetFontAndColor(). Changes to the background color\\nof the text view object itself are accomplished by calling an inherited BView function rather than a BTextView routine. The BView function SetViewColor(),\\nwhich was introduced in Chapter 5, is called to change a text view object\\'s background. The call changes the background color of the entire text view object (that\\nis, it changes the background color of the text view object\\'s boundary or framing\\nrectangle--a rectangle that includes the text area rectangle). Here, the background of a BTextView object is changed to pink:\\ntheTextView->SetViewColor(pinkColor);\\n\\nAligning text in a BTextView\\nA characteristic of the text in a BTextView that isn\\'t dependent on the font is the\\ntext\\'s placement within the text area of the text view object. By default, the text\\nthe user enters into a BTextView object is left-aligned. You can change the alignment by invoking the BTextView member function SetAlignment(). This routine works just like the BStringView version described earlier in this chapter: it\\naccepts one of the three Be-defined alignment constants. Pass B_ALIGN_LEFT, B_\\nALIGN_RIGHT, or B_ALIGN_CENTER and the text that\\'s currently in the text view\\nobject\\'s text rectangle will be appropriately aligned: each line in the text view\\nobject will start at the alignment indicated by the constant. Here, a BTextView\\nobject named theText has its alignment set to centered:\\ntheText->SetAlignment(B_ALIGN_CENTER);\\n\\nAny text subsequently entered in the affected BTextView object continues to follow the new alignment.\\nThe BTextView member function Alignment() is used to obtain the current\\nalignment of a text view object\\'s text. The BTextView version of Alignment()\\nworks just like the BStringView version. In this next snippet, the alignment of\\nthe text in a BTextView object is compared to the B_ALIGN_RIGHT constant to\\nsee if the text is currently right-aligned:\\nalignment\\n\\ntheAlignment;\\n\\ntheAlignment = theText->Alignment();\\nif (theAlignment == B_ALIGN_RIGHT)\\n// the text in this object is right-aligned\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nAnother BTextView function that affects text placement is SetWordWrap(). By\\ndefault, the text in a text view object word wraps: typed or pasted text fills the\\nwidth of the object\\'s text rectangle and then continues on the following line. Text\\ncan instead be forced to remain on a single line until a newline character (a hard\\nreturn established by a press of the Return key) designates that a new line be\\nstarted. Passing SetWordWrap() a value of false turns word wrapping off for a\\nparticular text view object, while passing a value of true turns word wrapping on.\\nTo test the current word wrapping state of a text view object, call the BTextView\\nfunction DoesWordWrap().\\n\\nWhile you can change the font characteristics (such as size and\\ncolor) of individual characters within a BTextView object, you can\\'t\\nchange the alignment of individual characters, words, or lines of text\\nwithin a single BTextView object. The setting of a BTextView\\nobject\\'s alignment or wrapping affects all characters in the view.\\n\\nText characteristics example project\\nThe TextViewFont project demonstrates how to add support for multiple character formats in a BTextView object. Figure 8-10 shows a window with a Text menu\\nand a BTextView object similar to the one appearing in this chapter\\'s TextView\\nand TextViewEdit example projects. Making a text selection and then choosing\\nAlter Text from the Text menu increases the size of the font of the selected text.\\nFor good measure (and to demonstrate the use of color in a BTextView), the Alter\\nText menu also changes the color of the selected text from black to red. In\\nFigure 8-10, the current selection consists of parts of the first and second words of\\ntext, and the Alter Text item has just been selected.\\n\\nFigure 8-10. The TextViewFont example program\\'s window\\n\\x0cEditable Text\\n\\n\\nA menu item named Alter Text is fine for this simple example, but is\\na bit ambiguous for a real-world application. If your own program\\nincludes stylable text, then it should of course include separate\\nmenu items for each possible action. For instance, if your program\\nallows the user to change the size of selected text, it should have\\nIncrease Size and Decrease Size menu items, or a menu item for\\neach possible font point size. Similarly, if your program allows the\\ncolor of text to be changed, it should have either a separate menu\\nitem for each possible color, or a menu item that brings up a color\\ncontrol (see Chapter 5 for a discussion of the BColorControl class).\\n\\nEarlier in this chapter, you saw that a standard editing message such as B_CUT is\\nassigned to the focus view by using menu-creation code like that shown here:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Cut\", new BMessage(B_CUT), \\'X\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nYou can set application-defined messages to go directly to the focus view in a similar manner. Here, FONT_TEST_MSG is an application-defined message type:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Alter Text\",\\nnew BMessage(FONT_TEST_MSG)));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nFor a standard editing message such as B_CUT, the work in handling the message\\nis done; the system knows what to do with a Be-defined standard message. For\\nmy own application-defined message, however, a bit more code is needed\\nbecause BTextView won\\'t know how to handle an application-defined FONT_\\nTEST_MSG. To create a BTextView object that can respond to an applicationdefined message, I defined a MyTextView class derived from BTextView. From\\nMyTextView.h, here\\'s the new class and the definition of the new message type:\\n#define\\n\\nFONT_TEST_MSG\\n\\n\\'fntt\\'\\n\\nclass MyTextView : public BTextView {\\npublic:\\nMyTextView(BRect viewFrame, char *name, BRect textBounds);\\nvirtual void\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n};\\n\\nThe MyTextView class consists of just two functions: a constructor to create a new\\nobject and a version of MessageReceived() that will be capable of handling the\\napplication-defined message. The implementation of these new functions can be\\nfound in MyTextView.cp. From that file, here\\'s the MyTextView constructor:\\nMyTextView::MyTextView(BRect viewFrame, char *name, BRect textBounds)\\n: BTextView(viewFrame, name, textBounds, B_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nThe MyTextView constructor is empty--it does nothing more than invoke the\\nBTextView constructor. For this example, I\\'m satisfied with how a BTextView\\nobject looks and works, so I\\'ve implemented the MyTextView constructor such\\nthat it simply passes the arguments it receives on to the BTextView constructor.\\nThe real purpose of creating the BTextView-derived class is to create a class that\\noverrides the BTextView version of MessageReceived(). The new version of\\nthis routine handles messages of the application-defined type FONT_TEST_MSG:\\nvoid MyTextView::MessageReceived(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase FONT_TEST_MSG:\\nBFont\\nfont;\\nsameProperties;\\nGetFontAndColor(&font, &sameProperties);\\nSetFontAndColor(&font, B_FONT_ALL, &redColor);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nMessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhen an object of type MyTextView receives a FONT_TEST_MSG message,\\nGetFontAndColor() is called to obtain a copy of the object\\'s font. The size of the\\nfont is set to 24 points and SetFontAndColor() is called to pass the font back to\\nthe MyTextView object. When calling SetFontAndColor(), the rgb_color variable redColor is included in the parameter list in order to set the MyTextView\\nobject to use a shade of red in displaying text.\\nAs is always the case, it\\'s important that MessageReceived() include the default\\ncondition that invokes the inherited version of MessageReceived(). The\\nMyTextView version of MessageReceived() handles only the application-defined\\nFONT_TEST_MSG, yet a MyTextView object that is the focus view will also be\\nreceiving B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL messages. When the\\nMyTextView version of MessageReceived() encounters a message of one of\\nthese Be-defined types, it passes it on to the BTextView version of\\nMessageReceived() for handling.\\nIn this chapter\\'s previous two examples, TextView and TextViewEdit, the\\nMyDrawView class included a data member of type BTextView. Here I also\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\ninclude a data member in the MyDrawView class, but I change it to be of type\\nMyTextView:\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyTextView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nLike the previous example versions of the MyDrawView constructor, the TextViewFont project\\'s version of the MyDrawView constructor creates a text view object.\\nHere, however, the object is of the new MyTextView class type. Before exiting,\\nthe constructor calls the BTextView function SetStylable() to give the new\\nMyTextView object support for multiple character formats. That ensures that\\nchanges made to the MyTextView object\\'s text apply to only the current selection--not to all of the text in the object.\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new MyTextView(viewFrame, \"TextView\", textBounds);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\nfTextView->SetStylable(true);\\n}\\n\\nScrolling\\nText or graphics your application uses may not always fit within the confines of a\\nview. Enter the scrollbar. The APIs for other operating systems that employ a\\ngraphical user interface include routines to work with scrollbars, but few implement this interface element as elegantly as the BeOS API does. The BScrollBar\\nclass makes it easy to add one or two scrollbars to any view. Better still, the\\nBScrollView class creates a bordered object with one or two BScrollBar\\nobjects already properly sized to fit any view you specify. Best of all, scrollbar\\noperation and updating is all automatic. Scrollbar objects are unique in that they\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\ndon\\'t receive drawing or mouse down messages--the Application Server intercepts these messages and responds accordingly.\\nAs part of the automatic handling of a scrollbar, the Application Server is responsible for changing the highlighting of a scrollbar. In Figure 8-11, you see the same\\nscrollbar with two different looks. When the contents of the view a scrollbar is\\nattached to exceed the size of the view, the scrollbar\\'s knob appears and the\\nscrollbar becomes enabled. As the content of the view increases, the scrollbar\\nknob automatically decreases in size to reflect the lessening amount of the total\\ntext being displayed within the view.\\n\\nFigure 8-11. A scrollbar\\'s look changes as the scrolled view\\'s content increases\\n\\nKeep in mind that from the ScrollBar preferences application the\\nuser can control the look and behavior of the scrollbars present in\\nall applications that run on his or her machine. For instance, the\\nScrollBar preferences control whether programs display a scrollbar\\nwith a pair of scroll arrows on each end, or just one. With that in\\nmind, you\\'ll note that the look of the scrollbars in this chapter\\'s figures differs (compare Figure 8-11 with Figure 8-13).\\n\\nScrollbars\\nTo make use of a scrollbar, create a BScrollBar object, designate a different view\\nto be the scrollbar\\'s target--the thing to be scrolled--and add the BScrollBar\\nobject to the same parent view as the target view. Or, more likely, create a\\nBScrollView object and let it do this work for you. Because the scrolling view is\\nso handy, the \"Scrolling\" section\\'s emphasis is on the BScrollView class. A\\nBScrollView object includes one or two BScrollBar objects, though, so a study\\nof the BScrollBar class won\\'t prove to be time wasted.\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nThe BScrollBar class\\nA scrollbar object is an instance of the BScrollBar class. Pass six arguments to its\\nconstructor, the prototype of which is shown here:\\nBScrollBar(BRect\\nframe,\\nconst char *name,\\nBView\\n*target,\\nfloat\\nmin,\\nfloat\\nmax,\\norientation posture)\\n\\nThe first parameter, frame, is a rectangle that defines the boundaries of the scrollbar. The coordinates of the rectangle are relative to the scrollbar\\'s parent view, not\\nto the thing that is to be scrolled. User interface guidelines state that scrollbars\\nshould be of a uniform thickness. That is, all horizontal scrollbars should be of the\\nsame height, and all vertical scrollbars should be of the same width. Use the Bedefined constants B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT and B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH to\\nensure that your program\\'s scrollbars have the same look as those used in other\\nBe applications. For instance, to set up the rectangle that defines a horizontal\\nscrollbar to run along the bottom of a text object, you might use this code:\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nThe second parameter serves the same purpose as the name parameter in other\\nBView-derived classes: it allows the view to be accessed by name using the BView\\nfunction FindView().\\nA scrollbar acts on a target--a view associated with the scrollbar. The target is\\nwhat gets scrolled, and is typically an object that holds text or graphics. To bind a\\nscrollbar to the object to be scrolled, follow these steps:\\n1. Create the target object.\\n2. Add the target object to a view (its parent view).\\n3. Create a scrollbar object, using the target object as the target parameter in\\nthe BScrollBar constructor.\\n4. Add the scrollbar object to the view that serves as the target object\\'s parent.\\nFor a target that displays graphics, the min and max parameters determine how\\nmuch of the target view is displayable. The values you use for these two parameters will be dependent on the total size of the target. If the target view is a\\nBTextView object, the values assigned to min and max are inconsequential--the\\nscrollbar is always aware of how much text is currently in the target view and\\nadjusts itself accordingly. The exception is if both min and max are set to 0. In\\nsuch a case, the scrollbar is disabled and no knob is drawn, regardless of the target view\\'s contents. Refer to the \"Scrollbar range\" section just ahead for more\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\ndetails on choosing values for these two parameters when the target consists of\\ngraphics.\\nThe last parameter, posture, designates the orientation of the scrollbar. To create\\na horizontal scrollbar, pass the Be-defined constant B_HORIZONTAL. For a vertical\\nscrollbar, pass B_VERTICAL.\\nThe following snippet provides an example of a call to the BScrollBar constructor. Here a horizontal scrollbar is being created for use with a previously created\\nBTextView object named theTextView. Because the target is a text object, the\\nvalues of min and max are arbitrarily selected:\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*horizScrollBar;\\n50.0 + B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT);\\nmin = 1.0;\\nmax = 1.0;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar = new BScrollBar(scrollFrame, \"ScrollBar\", theTextView,\\nmin, max, B_HORIZONTAL);\\n\\nScrollbar example project\\nThis chapter\\'s TextView example project demonstrated how a window can support editable text through the use of a BTextView object. Because the topic of\\nscrollbars hadn\\'t been presented when TextView was developed, the program\\'s\\ntext view didn\\'t include them. Now you\\'re ready to add a vertical scrollbar, a horizontal scrollbar, or both to a text view. As shown in Figure 8-12, for the TextViewScrollBar project I\\'ve elected to add just a vertical scrollbar to the window\\'s\\nBTextView object.\\n\\nFigure 8-12. The TextViewScrollBar example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe TextView example project shows how to set up viewFrame and textBounds,\\nthe rectangles that define the boundary of the window\\'s BTextView object and\\nthe area that displays text in that object. Here I\\'ll discuss only the code that\\'s been\\nadded to the TextView project to turn it into the TextViewScrollBar project. All\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nthose additions appear in the MyDrawView constructor. The new code involves the\\ncreation of a vertical scrollbar, and appears following the call to InsetBy():\\nBRect\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nAddChild(fTextView);\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*verticalBar;\\nscrollFrame;\\nmin = 1.0;\\nmax = 1.0;\\n\\nscrollFrame = viewFrame;\\nscrollFrame.left = scrollFrame.right;\\nscrollFrame.right = scrollFrame.left + B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\nverticalBar = new BScrollBar(scrollFrame, \"VerticalBar\", fTextView,\\nmin, max, B_VERTICAL);\\nAddChild(verticalBar);\\nverticalBar->SetResizingMode(B_FOLLOW_NONE);\\n}\\n\\nThe scrollbar will be added to the target\\'s parent view (MyDrawView), so the coordinates of the scrollbar\\'s rectangle are relative to the parent view, not to the target\\nview. The scrollFrame rectangle coordinates are first set to those of the target\\nview. That gives the scrollbar the same top and bottom coordinates as the target,\\nas desired. Then the scrollbar\\'s left and right side coordinates are adjusted so that\\nthe scrollbar lies flush on the right side of the target view. The scrollFrame rectangle is then used as the first parameter to the BScrollBar constructor. The previously created BTextView object fTextView is specified as the scrollbar\\'s target.\\nThe scrollbar is then added to MyDrawView, just as the target was previously\\nadded.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nGraphical user interface conventions dictate that a vertical scrollbar\\nbe located flush against the right side of the area that is scrollable,\\nand that a horizontal scrollbar be located flush against the bottom of\\nthe area that\\'s scrollable. But nothing in the BScrollBar class forces\\nyou to follow that convention. A scrollbar is associated with a view\\nto scroll by naming the view as the target in the BScrollBar constructor. Depending on the coordinates you choose for the frame\\nrectangle parameter of the BScrollBar constructor, the scrollbar\\ncan be placed anywhere in the parent view and it will still scroll the\\ncontents of the target view.\\n\\nNotice that in this example the resizing mode of the scrollbar is adjusted. The\\nBScrollBar constructor doesn\\'t include a sizing mode parameter. Instead, the\\nspecification of the scrolling bar\\'s orientation (the last parameter to the\\nBScrollBar constructor) defines a default behavior for the scrollbar. A vertically\\noriented scrollbar (like the one created here) resizes itself vertically. As the parent\\nview changes in size vertically, the vertical scrollbar will grow or shrink vertically.\\nAs the parent view changes in size horizontally, the vertical scrollbar will follow\\nthe parent view.\\nIn many cases these default characteristics are appropriate. In this project, they\\naren\\'t. I\\'ve given the BTextView object a resizing mode of B_FOLLOW_NONE, indicating that the text view object will remain a fixed size as the parent view changes\\nsize. In such a case, I want the target view\\'s scrollbar also to remain fixed in size\\nand location. A call to the BView function SetResizingMode() takes care of that\\ntask.\\nScrollbar range\\nIf a scrollbar\\'s target is a view that holds a graphical entity, such as a BView object\\nthat includes a BPicture object, the BScrollBar constructor min and max parameters take on significance. Together, min and max define a range that determines\\nhow much of the target view is displayable. Consider a view that is 250 pixels in\\nwidth and 200 pixels in height, and is to be displayed in a view that is 100 pixels\\nby 100 pixels in size. If this 100-by-100 pixel view has two scrollbars, and it\\'s\\ndesired that the user be able to scroll the entire view, the range of the horizontal\\nscrollbar should be 150 and the range of the vertical scrollbar should be 100.\\nFigure 8-13 illustrates this.\\nIn Figure 8-13, 100 pixels of the 250-pixel width of the view will always be displayed, so the horizontal range needs to be only 150 in order to allow the horizontal scrollbar to bring the remaining horizontal portions of the view through the\\ndisplay area. Similarly, 100 of the 200 vertical pixels will always be displayed in\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-13. An example of determining the range of a pair of scrollbars\\n\\nthe view, so the vertical range needs to be 100 in order to pass the remaining 100\\npixels through the display area. Assuming a graphics-holding view named\\ntheGraphicView, derived from a BView object, exists (as shown in Figure 8-13),\\nthe two scrollbars could be set up as shown in the following snippet. To see the\\nrelationship of the coordinates of the scrollbars to the view, refer to Figure 8-14.\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nBScrollBar\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\n*horizScrollBar;\\n300.0 + B_H_SCROLL_BAR_HEIGHT);\\nhorizMin =\\nhorizMax = 150.0;\\n*vertScrollBar;\\nvertMin =\\nvertMax = 100.0;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar = new BScrollBar(horizScrollFrame, \"HScrollBar\",\\ntheGraphicView,\\nhorizMin, horizMax, B_HORIZONTAL);\\nvertScrollBar = new BScrollBar(vertScrollFrame, \"VScrollBar\",\\ntheGraphicView,\\nvertMin, vertMax, B_VERTICAL);\\n\\nIf the target view changes size during program execution (for instance, your program may allow the user to replace the currently displayed contents of the view\\nwith different graphic), the range of any associated scrollbar should change, too.\\nThe BScrollBar function SetRange() exists for this purpose:\\nvoid SetRange(float\\nfloat\\n\\nmin,\\nmax)\\n\\nThe example just discussed has a horizontal scrollbar with a range of 0 to 150 pixels. If for some reason I wanted to allow the user to be able to scroll beyond the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-14. The coordinates of a pair of scrollbars and the picture to be scrolled\\n\\nright edge of the view, I could increase the scrollbar\\'s maximum value. Here I\\nchange the scrollbar\\'s range to allow the user to view 50 pixels of white space\\npast the view\\'s right edge:\\n\\nThe companion function to SetRange() is GetRange(). As expected, this function returns the current minimum and maximum scrolling values of a scrollbar:\\nvoid GetRange(float\\nfloat\\n\\n*min,\\n*max)\\n\\nIf this next snippet is executed after the preceding call to SetRange(), min should\\nhave a value of 0.0 and max should have a value of 200.0:\\nfloat\\nfloat\\n\\nmin;\\nmax;\\n\\nhorizScrollBar->GetRange(&min, &max);\\n\\nThe ScrollViewPicture example near the end of this chapter provides an example\\nof setting the scrollbar range for a BView object that\\'s used as the target for a\\nBScrollView object--a view that has built-in scrollbars.\\n\\nScrolling View\\nIt\\'s a relatively easy assignment to add scrollbars to a view, as just demonstrated in\\nthe TextViewScrollBar project. However, the BeOS API makes it easier still. The\\nBScrollView class creates a scroll view object that serves as a container for\\nanother view. This contained view can hold either text (as a BTextView does) or\\ngraphics (as a BPicture does). Regardless of the content of its contained view,\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nthe BScrollView object is responsible for adding scrollbars that allow for scrolling through the entire content and for making itself the parent of the contained\\nview.\\nThe BScrollView class\\nThe seven parameters of the BScrollView constructor make it possible to create a\\nscrolling view object that has one, two, or even no scrollbars:\\nBScrollView(const char\\nBView\\nbool\\nbool\\nborder_style\\n\\n*name,\\n*target,\\nresizingMode = B_FOLLOW_LEFT | B_FOLLOW_TOP,\\nflags = 0,\\nhorizontal = false,\\nvertical = false,\\nborder = B_FANCY_BORDER)\\n\\nThe name, resizingMode, and flags parameters serve the purposes expected of\\na BView-derived class. The name parameter allows the scroll view object to be\\naccessed by its name. The resizingMode specifies how the object is to be resized\\nas the parent view changes size: the default value of B_FOLLOW_LEFT |\\nB_FOLLOW_TOP indicates that the distance from the scroll view\\'s left side and its\\nparent\\'s left side will be fixed, as will the distance from the scroll view\\'s top and\\nits parent\\'s top. The flags parameter specifies the notification the scroll view\\nobject is to receive. The default value of 0 means that the object isn\\'t to receive\\nany notification.\\nThe target parameter specifies the previously created view object to be surrounded by the scroll view object. The contents of the target view are what is to\\nbe scrolled. There\\'s no need to specify any size for the new scroll view object. It\\nwill automatically be given a framing rectangle that accommodates the target view,\\nany scrollbars that may be a part of the scroll view object, and a border (if\\npresent).\\nA scroll view object can have a horizontal scrollbar, a vertical scrollbar, both, or\\nneither. The horizontal and vertical parameters specify which scrollbar or\\nbars should be a part of the scroll view object. By default, the object includes no\\nscrollbars (meaning the object serves as nothing more than a way to draw a border around a different view, as discussed in the border parameter description\\nnext). To include a scrollbar, simply set the appropriate horizontal or vertical\\nparameter to true.\\nThe border parameter specifies the type of border to surround the scroll view\\nobject. By default, a scroll view object has a fancy border; the appearance of a\\ngroove surrounds the object. To specify a plain line border, pass the Be-defined\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nconstant B_PLAIN_BORDER as the last argument to the BScrollView constructor.\\nTo omit the border completely, pass B_NO_BORDER instead.\\nIn this next snippet, a scroll view object is created with a plain border and a vertical scrollbar. Here it\\'s assumed that theTextView is a BTextView object that isn\\'t\\nresizable. Because the target is fixed in the window in which it resides, the scroll\\nview too can be fixed. As evidenced by the value of the resizingMode parameter (B_FOLLOW_NONE), theScrollView won\\'t be resizeable:\\nBScrollView\\n\\n*theScrollView;\\n\\ntheScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", theTextView, B_FOLLOW_NONE,\\n0, false, true, B_PLAIN_BORDER);\\n\\nScroll view example project\\nThis chapter\\'s TextViewScrollBar project modified the TextView example project to\\ndemonstrate how a BScrollBar object can be used to scroll the contents of a\\nBTextView object. This latest project, ScrollViewText, achieves the same effect.\\nHere, however, a BScrollView object is used to create the BTextView object\\'s\\nscrollbar. The resulting window looks similar to the one generated by the TextViewScrollBar project (refer back to Figure 8-12). Thanks to the BScrollView,\\nhowever, here the border around the text view object has shading, as shown in\\nFigure 8-15.\\n\\nFigure 8-15. The ScrollViewText example program\\'s window\\n\\nWhile the results of the TextViewScrollBar and ScrollView Text projects are similar, the effort expended to obtain the results differs. Using a BScrollView object\\nto supply the scrollbar (as done here) rather than using a BScrollBar object\\nmeans there\\'s no need to supply the scrollbar\\'s coordinates. The BScrollView\\nobject takes care of the scrollbar\\'s placement based on the location of the designated target. Additionally, there\\'s no need to draw a border around the text view;\\nthe BScrollBar object takes care of that task too.\\nThe MyDrawView class declaration is the same as it was for the original TextView\\nproject, with the addition of a BScrollView object:\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor holds the scroll view code:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect textBounds;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView, B_FOLLOW_NONE,\\n0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n}\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor begins by setting up and creating a BTextView\\nobject. This code is the same as the code that appears in the TextView version of\\nthe MyDrawView constructor, with one exception. Here, a call to AddChild()\\ndoesn\\'t immediately follow the creation of the text view object. The newly created\\nBTextView object isn\\'t added to the drawing view because it is instead added to\\nthe BScrollView object when it is passed to the scroll view\\'s constructor. The\\nBScrollView object is then added to the drawing view. When the program creates a window, that window\\'s view hierarchy will look like the one pictured in\\nFigure 8-16. In this figure, you see that the BScrollView object fScrollView is\\nthe parent to two views: the target view fMyTextView and a BScrollBar object\\ncreated by the BScrollView constructor. Later, in the ScrollViewPicture project,\\nyou\\'ll see how your code can easily access this implicitly created scrollbar.\\nThe implementation of this project\\'s AttachedToWindow() function is identical to\\nthe TextView projects: call SetFont() and SetFontSize() to specify font information for the drawing view, then call fTextView->MakeFocus() to start the cursor blinking in the BTextView object. The implementation of Draw() is simple--\\nhere it\\'s an empty function. In the TextView project, StrokeRect() was invoked\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 8-16.

Typically, a simple text editor displays a resizable window bordered by a vertical scrollbar and possibly a horizontal scrollbar. Figure 8-17 shows such a window--the window displayed by the\\nScrollViewWindow project.\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-17. The ScrollViewWindow example program\\'s window\\n\\nThe ScrollViewWindow project includes only slight modifications to the TextViewScrollBar project. All the changes are found in the MyDrawView constructor:\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nBRect viewFrame;\\nBRect textBounds;\\nviewFrame = Bounds();\\nviewFrame.right -= B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\ntextBounds.left = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.right = viewFrame.right - viewFrame.left - TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.top = TEXT_INSET;\\ntextBounds.bottom = viewFrame.bottom - viewFrame.top - TEXT_INSET;\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, 0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n}\\n\\nA call to the BView function Bounds() sets the coordinates of what is to be the\\nBScrollView target, the BTextView view object, to the coordinates of the drawing view. The drawing view itself is the same size as the content area of the window it resides in, so this brings me close to my goal of making the entire content\\narea of the window capable of holding user-entered text. The exception is that\\nroom needs to be allowed for the vertical scrollbar. Subtracting the width of this\\nscrollbar results in a viewFrame rectangle with the desired size.\\nThe other changes to the MyDrawView constructor involve the resizingMode\\nparameter to both the BTextView constructor and the BScrollView constructor.\\nIn the previous example, the scroll view was fixed in size, so neither the scroll\\nview nor its target needed to be concerned with resizing. Here I want the text area\\nof the window to always occupy the entire content area of the window, less\\nthe window\\'s scrollbar area. A resizingMode of B_FOLLOW_ALL (rather than\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\n\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE) tells both the BScrollView object and its BTextView target that\\nthey should automatically resize themselves as the user changes the parent window\\'s size.\\nAccessing a BScrollView scrollbar\\nThe BScrollView constructor lets you specify whether a BScrollView object\\nshould include a horizontal scrollbar, a vertical scrollbar, or both. The constructor\\nis responsible for creating the appropriate number of BScrollBar objects and\\nplacing them within the BScrollView object. The BScrollView constructor gives\\neach of its BScrollBar objects a default range of 0.0 to 1000.0. If the\\nBScrollView object\\'s target is a BTextView, these default minimum and maximum values always suffice--the BTextView object makes sure that the ranges of\\nthe scrollbars that target it are adjusted accordingly. If the BScrollView object\\'s\\ntarget is instead a view that holds graphics, you\\'ll need to adjust the range of each\\nscrollbar so that the user is guaranteed visual access to the entire target view.\\nThis chapter\\'s \"Scrollbar range\" section describes how to determine the range for a\\nscrollbar to scroll graphics, as well as how to use the BScrollBar function\\nSetRange() to set a scrollbar\\'s minimum and maximum values. After determining\\nthe range a scroll view object\\'s scrollbar should have, invoke the BScrollView\\nfunction ScrollBar() to gain access to the scrollbar in question. Pass\\nScrollBar() the type of scrollbar (B_HORIZONTAL or B_VERTICAL) to access,\\nand the routine returns the BScrollBar object. Then invoke that object\\'s\\nSetRange() function to reset its range. Here, access to the vertical scrollbar of a\\nBScrollView object named theScrollView is gained, and the scrollbar\\'s range is\\nthen set to a minimum of 0.0 and a maximum of 340.0:\\nBScrollBar\\n\\n*scrollBar;\\n\\nscrollBar = theScrollView->ScrollBar(B_VERTICAL);\\n\\nScrollbar access example project\\nWhile topics such as the BStringView class and the BTextView class have made\\nthe display of text the focus of this chapter, I\\'ll close with an example that demonstrates how to scroll a picture. The BScrollView class (covered later in this section) places no restrictions on what type of view is to be the designated target, so\\nthe differences between scrolling text and scrolling graphics are minimal. As\\nshown in Figure 8-18, the ScrollViewPicture project demonstrates how to use a\\nBPicture object as the target of a BScrollView object.\\nThis example would work just fine with a very simple picture, such as one created by drawing a single large rectangle. I\\'ve opted to instead create a slightly\\nmore complex picture, and at the same time set up the project such that it\\'s an\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nFigure 8-18. The ScrollViewPicture example program\\'s window\\n\\neasy task to make the picture far more complex. I\\'ve done that by creating a\\nBView-derived class named MyPictureView. The declaration of this new class\\nappears in the MyPictureView.h header file, while the implementations of the class\\nmember functions can be found in MyPictureView.cpp. Here\\'s the MyPictureView\\ndeclaration:\\nclass MyPictureView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBPicture\\n\\nMyPictureView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPicture;\\n\\n};\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see in this example, a MyPictureView object will become the target of a\\nBScrollView object. That means the MyPictureView class could include any\\nnumber of graphics, and the scroll view object will view them all as a single entity.\\nSo while I\\'ve included a single BPicture data member in the MyPictureView,\\nyour BView-derived class could hold two, three, or three hundred pictures, along\\nwith other graphic data members such as polygons or bitmaps (see Chapter 5 for\\nshape-drawing information and Chapter 10, Files, for bitmap details).\\nThe AttachedToWindow() routine sets up the picture. Recall that such code can\\'t\\nappear in the constructor of the picture\\'s parent view. That\\'s because the\\nBPicture definition relies on the current state of the picture\\'s parent view, and\\nthe parent view\\'s state isn\\'t completely set up until the execution of\\nAttachedToWindow().\\nvoid MyPictureView::AttachedToWindow()\\n{\\nSetFont(be_bold_font);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 8: Text\\nBeginPicture(new BPicture);\\nBRect aRect;\\nfor (i=0; i<100; i++) {\\nStrokeRect(aRect);\\n}\\nfPicture = EndPicture();\\n}\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that your own BView class could contain more\\nthan one BPicture data member. Looking at the above version of\\nAttachedToWindow(), you might think that\\'s unnecessary because\\nyou can define a single BPicture object to include all the graphics\\na view needs. That may be the case--or it may not be. Your program might construct a BView-derived class by piecing together multiple BPicture objects. For instance, your application may give the\\nuser the opportunity to define a single large graphic by selecting\\nnumerous small pictures.\\n\\nThe BScrollView object will exist in a MyDrawView object, and will have a\\nBScrollView object as its target. I\\'ve included MyPictureView and\\nBScrollView data members in the MyDrawView class to keep track of these\\nobjects.\\nclass MyDrawView : public BView {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyPictureView\\nBScrollView\\n\\nMyDrawView(BRect frame, char *name);\\nAttachedToWindow();\\nDraw(BRect updateRect);\\n\\n*fPictureView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyDrawView constructor begins by creating what will be the target view:\\nfPictureView. Next, it creates a BScrollView object with fPictureView as the\\ntarget. After adding the scroll view to the drawing view, the default ranges of the\\nscroll view\\'s two scrollbars are altered. Looking back at the MyPictureView version of AttachedToWindow(), you\\'ll note that the BPicture object will be 300\\npixels wide and 300 pixels high. Yet the width and height of the viewFrame rectangle that is to display this picture are each only 100 pixels. The difference in the\\nactual size of the picture and the size of the rectangle the picture\\'s displayed in is\\nused in resetting the scrollbar ranges:\\n\\x0cScrolling\\n\\n\\nMyDrawView::MyDrawView(BRect rect, char *name)\\n: BView(rect, name, B_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW)\\n{\\nfPictureView = new MyPictureView(viewFrame, \"MyPictureView\");\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fPictureView,\\nB_FOLLOW_NONE, 0, true, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\nBScrollBar\\n\\n*scrollBar;\\n\\nscrollBar = fScrollView->ScrollBar(B_VERTICAL);\\nscrollBar = fScrollView->ScrollBar(B_HORIZONTAL);\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nMessages and Threads\\n\\nIn this chapter:\\n The Application Kit\\nand Messages\\n Application-Defined\\nMessages\\n\\n9.\\n\\nSeveral years ago Be, Inc. set out to develop a new operating system--one they\\neventually dubbed the Media OS. The goal was to create an operating system that\\ncould keep up with the computationally intensive demands of media professionals who routinely worked with complex and resource-hungry graphics and audio\\nfiles. From the start, Be knew that threads and messages would be of paramount\\nimportance. A multithreaded environment means that a single application can\\nsimultaneously carry out multiple tasks. On a single-processor machine, CPU idle\\ntime is reduced as the processor services one thread followed by another. On a\\nmultiprocessor machine, task time really improves as different CPUs can be dedicated to the servicing of different threads.\\nThreads can be considered roadways that allow the system to communicate with\\nan object, one object to communicate with another object, and even one application to communicate with another application. Continuing with the analogy, messages are the vehicles that carry the information, or data, that is to be passed from\\none entity to another. Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, introduced messages, and seldom since then have a couple of pages passed without a direct or\\nindirect reference to messages. In this chapter, I\\'ll formally explain of how messages and threads work. In doing so, you\\'ll see how your application can create its\\nown messages and use them to let one object tell another object what to do. You\\'ll\\nsee how sending a message can trigger an object to perform some desired action.\\nYou\\'ll also see how a message can be filled with any manner of data before it\\'s\\nsent. Once received, the recipient object has access to any and all of the data held\\nwithin the message.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nThe Application Kit and Messages\\nServers are background processes that exist to serve the basic, low-level needs of\\napplications. The BeOS end user makes indirect use of servers every time he or\\nshe runs a Be application. As a Be programmer, you make more direct use of servers by using the BeOS application programming interface. The classes of the API\\nare organized into the software kits that have been discussed at length throughout\\nthis book. The most basic, and perhaps most important, of these kits is the Application Kit. Among the classes defined in this kit is the BApplication class. Your\\napplication begins by creating a BApplication object. When an instance of that\\nclass is created, your application connects to the Application Server, and can make\\nuse of all the services provided by that server. Tasks handled by the Application\\nServer include the provision of windows, the handling of the interaction between\\nthese windows, and the monitoring and reporting of user events such as mouse\\nbutton clicks. In short, the Application Server, and indirectly the classes of the\\nApplication Kit, allow the system to communicate with an application. This communication takes place via messages that travel by way of threads.\\nThe classes of the Application Kit (shown in Figure 9-1) fall into the four categories listed below. Of these groupings, it\\'s messaging that\\'s the focus of this chapter.\\nMessaging\\nThe Application Server delivers system messages to an application. Additionally, an application can send application-defined messages to itself (the purpose being to pass information from one object to another). The Application\\nKit defines a number of message-related classes that are used to create,\\ndeliver, and handle these messages. Among these classes are: BMessage,\\nBLooper, and BHandler.\\nBApplication class\\nAn application\\'s single BApplication object is the program\\'s interface to the\\nApplication Server.\\nBRoster class\\nThe system keeps a roster, or list, of all executing applications. Upon the\\nlaunch of your application, a BRoster object is automatically created. In the\\nevent that your program needs to communicate with other running applications, it can do so by accessing this BRoster object.\\nBClipboard class\\nThe system keeps a single clipboard as a repository for information that can\\nbe shared--via copying, cutting, and pasting--between objects in an application and between distinct applications. Upon launch, your application automatically creates a BClipboard object that is used to access the systemwide\\nclipboard.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBRoster\\nBRoster\\n\\nSupport Kit\\nBObjects\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nBApplication\\n\\nInterface Kit\\nBWindow\\n\\nBMessenger\\nBMessageFiller\\n\\nApplication Kit\\nBMessageQueue\\n\\nOther Be Kit\\n\\nFigure 9-1. The inheritance hierarchy for the Application Kit\\n\\nMessaging\\nThe Application Kit defines the classes that allow an application to be multithreaded. While threads run independently, they do need a means of communicating with one another. So the Application Kit also defines classes that allow for the\\ncreation and delivery of messages.\\nThe BMessage class is used to create message objects. A single message can contain as little or as much information as appropriate for its purpose. Once created\\nwithin one thread, a message can be delivered to the same thread, a different\\nthread in the same application, or to a thread in a different application altogether.\\nHow a thread obtains a message and then handles that message is determined by\\nthe Application Kit classes BLooper and BHandler. A BLooper object runs a message loop in a thread. This message loop receives messages and dispatches each\\nto a BHandler object. The handler object is responsible for handling the message\\nas appropriate for the message type. Notice in Figure 9-1 that the BLooper class is\\nderived from the BHandler class. This means that a looper object is also a handler object, and can thus pass a message to itself. While this may sound selfdefeating, it actually serves as a quite useful mechanism for initiating and carrying\\nout a task from within one object, such as a window (which, as shown in\\nFigure 9-1, is both a looper and a handler). Throughout this chapter you\\'ll see several examples of the creating of messages and the dispatching of these messages\\nboth by the object that created them and by other objects.\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nBecause an application is multithreaded, more than one thread may attempt to\\naccess the same data. For read-only data (data that can\\'t be written to or altered),\\nthat\\'s not a problem. For read-write data, a problem could exist; if both accessing\\nobjects try to alter the same data at the same time, the result will be at best unpredictable and at worst disastrous. To prevent simultaneous data access, the BeOS\\nallows for the locking of data. When one thread is about to access data, it can first\\nlock it. While locked, other threads are prevented access. When a thread encounters locked data, it finds itself waiting in queue. Only after the thread that locked\\nthe data later unlocks it will other threads get a chance at access.\\nIn many instances, the locking and unlocking of data is handled by the system.\\nFor instance, when a window receives a message (when a message enters the window thread\\'s message loop), the BWindow object is locked until the message is\\nhandled. From Chapter 4 you know that a window object has a host of characteristics, such as size, that can be altered at runtime. If the window wasn\\'t locked during message handling, and the message indicated that, say, the window should be\\nresized, the possibility exists for a second such message to arrive at the same time\\nand also attempt to change the values of the window object\\'s screen coordinates.\\nOccasionally there\\'ll be cases where your application is responsible for the locking and unlocking of data. For such occasions, the object to be locked will have\\nLock() and Unlock() member functions in its class definition. This chapter provides one such instance of manually locking and unlocking an object. If your program wants to add data to the clipboard (as opposed to the user placing it there\\nby a copy or cut), it should first lock the clipboard (in case the user does in fact\\nperform a copy or cut while your program is in the process of placing data on the\\nclipboard!). This chapter\\'s ClipboardMessage project shows how this is done.\\n\\nApplication Kit Classes\\nThe previous section described the Application Kit classes directly involved with\\nmessages--the BMessage, BLooper, and BHandler classes. Other Application Kit\\nclasses, while not as important in terms of messaging, are still noteworthy. Be suggests that the collective message-related classes make up one of four Application\\nKit categories. The other three each contain a single class--BApplication,\\nBRoster, and BClipboard class. Those three classes are discussed next.\\nBApplication class\\nBy now you\\'re quite familiar with the notion that every program must create a single instance of the BApplication class (or of an application-defined\\nBApplication-derived class). The BApplication class is derived from the\\nBLooper class, so an object of this class type runs its own message loop. A program\\'s application object is connected to the Application Server, and system\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nmessages sent to the program enter the application object\\'s message loop. If a\\nmessage is a system message (such as a B_QUIT_REQUESTED), it is eventually handled by a BApplication hook function (such as QuitRequested()). The\\nBApplication class defines a MessageReceived() function that augments the\\nBHandler version of this routine. If your program wants the application object to\\nhandle application-defined messages, it should override and augment the\\nBApplication version MessageReceived(). To do that, your program defines a\\nmessage constant, declares MessageReceived() in the BApplication-derived\\nclass declaration, and implements MessageReceived():\\n#define\\n\\nMY_APP_DEFINED_MSG\\n\\n\\'mymg\\'\\n\\nclass MyAppClass : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyAppClass();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nvoid MyAppClass::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MY_APP_DEFINED_MSG:\\n// handle this type of message\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\ninherited::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nPrevious example projects haven\\'t made direct use of MessageReceived() in the\\napplication object. This chapter\\'s AlertMessage project (discussed in the \"Messageposting example project\" section) provides a specific example.\\n\\nLike the BApplication class, the BWindow class is derived from\\nBLooper. So, like an application object, a window object runs a\\nmessage loop. And, again like an application object, a window\\nobject has a connection to the Application Server--so a window can\\nbe the recipient of system messages. Examples of these interface system messages include B_QUIT_REQUESTED, B_ZOOM, B_MOUSE_DOWN,\\nB_KEY_DOWN, and B_WINDOW_RESIZED messages.\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\n\\n\\nBRoster class\\nThe system, of course, keeps track of all running applications. Some of the information about these processes is stored in a roster, or table, in memory. Much of\\nthis information about other executing applications is available to your executing\\napplication. Your program won\\'t access this roster directly, though. Instead, it will\\nrely on the be_roster global variable. When an application launches, an object of\\nthe BRoster class is automatically created and assigned to be_roster.\\nTo garner information about or communicate via messages with another application, you simply refer to be_roster and invoke one of the BRoster member\\nfunctions. Some of the important BRoster functions and their purposes include:\\nGetAppList()\\nReturns an identifier for each running application.\\nGetAppInfo()\\nProvides information about a specified application.\\nActivateApp()\\nActivates an already running application by bringing one of its windows to the\\nfront and activating it.\\nBroadcast()\\nBroadcasts, or sends, a message to all currently running applications.\\nIsRunning()\\nDetermines if a specified application is currently running.\\nLaunch()\\nLocates an application on disk and launches it.\\nFindApp()\\nLocates an application (as Launch() does), but doesn\\'t launch it.\\nOne of the ways be_roster identifies an application is by the program\\'s signature (presenting you with another reason to make sure your application\\'s signature is unique--as mentioned in Chapter 2, BeIDE Projects). The very simple RosterCheck example project in this chapter takes advantage of this in order to see\\nhow many instances of the RosterCheck program are currently running. RosterCheck allows itself to be launched more than once, but not more than twice.\\n\\nWhen creating an application that is to allow for multiple instances\\nof the program, you need make sure that the application flags field\\nresource is set to multiple launch. Chapter 2 discusses this resource\\nand how to set it. In short, you double-click on the project\\'s\\nresource file to open it, then click the Multiple Launch radio button\\nin the Application Flags section.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nThe roster keeps track of each application that is running, including multiple\\ninstances of the same application. To check the roster and make use of the results,\\njust a few lines of code in the application constructor are all that\\'s needed:\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\")\\n{\\nBList theList;\\nlong\\nnumApps;\\nbe_roster->GetAppList(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\", &theList);\\nnumApps = theList.CountItems();\\nif (numApps > 2) {\\nPostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn;\\n}\\nBRect\\n\\naRect;\\n\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nWhen passed an application signature and a pointer to a BList object, the\\nBRoster function GetAppList() examines the roster and fills in the list object\\nwith an item for each currently running application with the matching signature.\\nTo know what to do next, you need at least a passing familiarity with the BList\\nclass, a class not yet mentioned in this book.\\nThe BList class is a part of the Support Kit, which defines datatypes, classes, and\\nutilities any application can use. An instance of the BList class is used to hold a\\nlist of data pointers in an orderly fashion. Keeping data in a BList is handy\\nbecause you can then use existing BList member functions to further organize or\\nmanipulate the data. The partial listing of the BList class hints at the things a list\\ncan do:\\nclass BList {\\npublic:\\n\\nvirtual\\n\\nBList(const BList&);\\n~BList();\\n\\nBList\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nbool\\nvoid\\nbool\\n\\n&operator=(const BList &from);\\nAddItem(void *item);\\nAddItem(void *item, int32 atIndex);\\nAddList(BList *newItems);\\nAddList(BList *newItems, int32 atIndex);\\nRemoveItem(void *item);\\n\\x0cThe Application Kit and Messages\\nbool\\nvoid\\n\\nReplaceItem(int32 index, void *newItem);\\nMakeEmpty();\\n\\nvoid\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nSortItems(int (*cmp)(const void *, const void *));\\n\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\nvoid\\n\\n*FirstItem() const;\\n*LastItem() const;\\n*Items() const;\\n\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nHasItem(void *item) const;\\nIndexOf(void *item) const;\\nCountItems() const;\\nIsEmpty() const;\\n\\n\\n...\\n}\\n\\nThe pointers that are stored in a list can reference any type of data, so the\\nBRoster function GetAppList() stores a reference to each running application\\nwith the specified signature. After calling GetAppList() you can find out how\\nmany instances of the application in question are currently running--just invoke\\nCountItems() to see how many items are in the list. That\\'s exactly what I do in\\nthe RosterCheck project:\\nBList\\nlong\\n\\ntheList;\\nnumApps;\\n\\nbe_roster->GetAppList(\"application/x-dps-twoapps\", &theList);\\nnumApps = theList.CountItems();\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, numApps holds the number of executing instances\\nof the RosterCheck program (including the instance that\\'s just been launched and\\nis executing the above code). The following code limits the number of times the\\nuser can execute RosterCheck to two; if you try to launch RosterCheck a third\\ntime, the program will immediately quit:\\nif (numApps > 2) {\\nPostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn;\\n}\\n\\nA more well-behaved version of RosterCheck would post an alert explaining why\\nthe program quit. It would also have some reason for limiting the number of\\ninstances of the program--my arbitrary limit of two exists so that I can demonstrate that the roster in general, and a BRoster member function in particular,\\nwork!\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBClipboard class\\nThe previous section described the system\\'s application roster, the be_roster global object used to access the roster, and the BRoster class that defines the type of\\nobject be_roster is. The clipboard works in a similar vein: there\\'s one system\\nclipboard, it\\'s accessed by a be_clipboard global object, and that object is of the\\nBe class BClipboard.\\nObjects of some class types make use of be_clipboard without any intervention\\non your part. For instance, in Chapter 8, Text, you saw that a BTextView object\\nautomatically supports the editing functions cut, copy, paste, and select all. When\\nthe user cuts text from a BTextView object, the object places that text on the system clipboard. Because this clipboard is global to the system, the cut data\\nbecomes available to both the application from which the data was cut and any\\nother application that supports the pasting of data.\\nAs you may suspect, when editing takes place in a BTextView object, messages\\nare involved. In particular, the BTextView object responds to B_CUT, B_COPY,\\nB_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL messages. The B_CUT and B_COPY messages add to\\nthe clipboard the currently selected text in the text view object that\\'s the focus\\nview. The B_PASTE message retrieves text from the clipboard and pastes it to the\\ninsertion point in the text view object that\\'s the focus view. If you want your program to manually force other text to be added to the clipboard, or if you want\\nyour program to manually retrieve the current text from the clipboard without\\npasting it anywhere, you can do so by directly accessing the clipboard.\\nTo fully appreciate how to work with the clipboard, you\\'ll want to read this chapter\\'s \"Working with BMessage Objects\" section. In particular, the \"Data, messages,\\nand the clipboard\" subsection discusses messages as they pertain to the clipboard,\\nand the \"Clipboard example project\" subsection provides an example of adding\\ntext directly to the clipboard without any intervention on the part of the user.\\n\\nApplication-Defined Messages\\nUp to this point, you\\'ve dealt mostly with system messages--messages generated\\nand dispatched by the system. The Message Protocols appendix of the Be Book\\ndefines all the system messages. In short, system messages fall into the following\\ncategories:\\nApplication system messages\\nSuch a message concerns the application itself, and is delivered to the\\nBApplication object. The application handles the message by way of a hook\\nfunction, as described in Chapter 4. B_QUIT_REQUESTED is one application\\nmessage with which you\\'re familiar.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nInterface system messages\\nSuch a message concerns a single window, and is delivered to a BWindow\\nobject. The window handles the message by way of a hook function, or, if the\\nmessage affects a view in the window, passes it on to the BView object, which\\nhandles it by way of a hook function. A B_WINDOW_ACTIVATED message is an\\nexample of an interface message that would be handled by a window, while a\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN message is an example of an interface message that would be\\npassed on to a view (the view the cursor was over at the time of the mouse\\nbutton click) for handling.\\nStandard messages\\nSuch a message is produced by either the system or application, but isn\\'t handled by means of a hook function. The editing messages covered in\\nChapter 8B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALLare examples of\\nstandard messages. When a user selects text in a BTextView object and\\npresses Command-x, the affected window generates a B_CUT message that is\\nsent to the text view object. That object automatically handles the text cutting\\nby invoking the BTextView function Cut().\\nThe system and standard messages are important to making things happen in your\\napplication--they allow the user to interact with your program. But these messages are only a part of the powerful Be messaging system. Your application is\\nalso free to define its own message constants, create messages of these application-defined types, add data to these messages, and then pass the messages on to\\nother object or even other applications.\\n\\nMessage Handling\\nAn application-defined message can be issued automatically in response to a user\\naction such as a menu item selection or a control activation. Your application can\\nalso issue, or post, a message explicitly without any user intervention. Before\\ngoing into the details of application-defined messages, a quick review of system\\nmessages will minimize confusion between how these different types of messages\\nare handled.\\nSystem message handling\\nWhen an application receives a system message, it is dispatched by sending the\\nmessage to the affected BHandler object. That object then invokes a hook function--a function specifically implemented to handle one particular type of system\\nmessage.\\nA system message is the result of an action external to the application. The message is generated by the operating system, and is delivered to an application\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nobject or a window object. That object, or an object the message is subsequently\\npassed to, invokes the appropriate hook function.\\nAs an example, consider a mouse button click. The click of a mouse button\\ninspires the Application Server to generate a B_MOUSE_DOWN message. The server\\npasses this message to the affected window (the window under the cursor at the\\ntime of the mouse button click). A BWindow object is a looper, so the window has\\nits own thread that runs a message loop. From this loop, the message is dispatched to a handler, which in this example is the affected view (the view under\\nthe cursor at the time of the mouse button click). A BView object is a handler, so it\\ncan be the recipient of a passed message. A handler object in general, and a\\nBView-derived object in particular, has its own hook functions (either inherited\\nfrom the BView class or overridden). For a B_MOUSE_DOWN message, the pertinent\\nfunction the view invokes is the BView hook function MouseDown(). Figure 9-2\\nillustrates system message dispatching for this situation.\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nB_MOUSE_DOWN\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-2. A message moves from the Application Server to a view\\n\\nIn Figure 9-2, you see that the window invokes a function named\\nDispatchMessage(). This is a BLooper function that BWindow augments (overrides in order to add window-specific functionality, and then invokes the inherited version as well). DispatchMessage() is responsible for forwarding a system\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nmessage to the affected view. While your application can override\\nDispatchMessage(), it should seldom need to. Similarly, while\\nDispatchMessage() can be invoked directly, it\\'s best to leave the timing of the\\ncall to the system. Leave it to the looper object (whether the application or a window) to automatically use this message-forwarding routine as it sees fit. In this\\nexample, DispatchMessage() will make sure that the BView object\\'s version of\\nthe hook function MouseDown() is invoked.\\nChapter 4 provided a variety of examples that demonstrated system message handling, including B_MOUSE_DOWN and B_KEY_DOWN messages. If you refer back to\\nany of these examples, you\\'ll see that each uses a hook function.\\nApplication-defined message handling and implicitly generated messages\\nAn application-defined message isn\\'t handled by means of a hook function. The\\nvery fact that your application defines the message means that no pre-existing\\nhook function could be included in whatever BHandler-derived class the recipient object belongs to. Instead, an application-defined message is always dispatched by way of a call to MessageReceived(). The looper object that receives\\nthe message passes it to a handler object, which uses its version of\\nMessageReceived() to carry out the message\\'s action. That leads to the distinction that a system message is usually handled by a hook function (some systemgenerated messages, such as the standard messages resulting from text edits, need\\nto be handled by a version of MessageReceived()), while an application-defined\\nmessage is always handled by a MessageReceived() function.\\nYou\\'ve seen several examples of how an application works with applicationdefined messages--most notably in the chapters that deal with controls and menus\\n(Chapter 6, Controls and Messages, and Chapter 7, Menus). For instance, a program that implements message handling through a menu item first defines a message constant:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_ADV_HELP_MSG\\n\\n\\'help\\'\\n\\nThe program then includes this message constant in the creation of a new\\nBMessage object--as is done here as part of the process of creating a new\\nBMenuItem:\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Advanced Help\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG)));\\n\\nFinally, the message constant appears in a case section in the BWindow object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function--as in this snippet:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\ncase MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG:\\nOpenHelpWindow(MENU_ADV_HELP_MSG);\\nbreak;\\n// other case sections here\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nLike a system message, an application-defined message relies on the BLooperinherited function DispatchMessage() to transfer the application-defined message from the looper to the handler. Again, your code shouldn\\'t ever have to redefine DispatchMessage() or invoke it directly. As shown in Figure 9-3, in this\\nexample the BWindow object is both the looper and handler. The menu item\\ngenerated message is placed in the window\\'s message loop, and the window\\nobject sends the message to itself and invokes the window\\'s version of\\nMessageReceived() via the BWindow version of DispatchMessage().\\nApplication\\nserver\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nMENU_ADV_HELP_MSG\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBLooper\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-3. A message moves from a window back to that window\\n\\nWhile the window generates the message and delivers it to itself, the\\nApplication Server may play a role in the act. This is most evident\\nfor a message generated by a menu item or control. In each case,\\nthe Application Server inserts when data into the message so the\\napplication knows at what instant the event (generally a mouse button click) that initiated the message occurred.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nApplication-defined message handling and explicitly generated messages\\nA user request, such as menu item selection or control activation, is one way an\\napplication-defined message gets generated and MessageReceived() gets\\ninvoked. In this case, the message is created and passed automatically. You may\\nencounter other instances where it\\'s appropriate for one object in a program to\\nreceive information, or take some action, based on circumstances other than a user\\naction. To do that, your program can have an object (such as a window) create a\\nmessage object, and then have that message posted to a looper object.\\nAs an example, consider a window that needs to pass some information to the\\napplication. Perhaps the window is performing some lengthy task, and it wants the\\napplication to know when the task is completed. The window could create a\\nBMessage object and send it to the application. In a simple case, the arrival of the\\nmessage might be enough information for the application. However, a message\\ncan contain any amount of information, so a more sophisticated example might\\nhave the message holding information about the completed task, such as the\\nlength of time it took to execute the task.\\nWhen PostMessage() is called, the specified message is delivered to the looper\\nthe function is called upon. You\\'ve seen this in all of the example projects to this\\npoint. When the user clicks on a window\\'s close button, the window\\'s\\nQuitRequested() hook function is invoked. In that function, the application\\nobject invokes PostMessage(). Here the application object acts as a looper to\\npost the message, then acts as a handler to dispatch the message to its\\nMessageReceived() function:\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\nA message posted to a looper via a call to PostMessage() gets delivered, or dispatched, via the DispatchMessage() function. When it comes time to send a\\nmessage, the sender (the looper object) calls PostMessage(). PostMessage() in\\nturn calls DispatchMessage(). In the above version of QuitRequested(), the\\nmessage posted is a Be-defined message, but that needn\\'t be the case--it could be\\nan application-defined one. In such a case, an object such as a window would create the message using new and the BMessage constructor (as discussed ahead). If\\nthe message was to be delivered to the application, the message could then be\\nposted just as it was in QuitRequested(). Figure 9-4 illustrates the process.\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nBWindow\\nobject\\n\\nBApplication\\nobject\\n\\nnew BMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nnew BMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nBLooper\\n\\nDispatchMessage()\\nMY_MESSAGE\\n\\nBApplication\\nobject\\n\\nBHandler\\n\\nMessageReceived()\\n\\nFigure 9-4. A message moves from a window to the application\\n\\nWorking with BMessage Objects\\nThe preceding section served as an introduction to how an application might create a message object and send it to another object. That section was just that--an\\nintroduction. Here you\\'ll see the details--and code--for creating, posting, and\\nhandling BMessage objects.\\nCreating a message\\nThe BMessage constructor has a single parameter--a uint32 value represents the\\nnew message object\\'s command constant. System message command constants\\nalways begin with B_, as in B_QUIT_REQUESTED and B_MOUSE_DOWN, so to be\\nquickly recognized as an application-defined message, your application-defined\\ncommand constants should begin with any other combination of characters. Additionally, each system message\\'s command constant is defined to be a four-character string that consists of only uppercase characters and, optionally, underscore\\ncharacters. Defining an application-defined message by any other scheme (such as\\nusing all lowercase characters) ensures that the message won\\'t be misinterpreted\\nas a system message. Here\\'s an example of the creation of a BMessage object:\\n#define\\n\\nWAGER_MSG\\n\\n\\'wger\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nfirstRaceWagerMsg = new BMessage(WAGER_MSG);\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nThe BMessage constructor sets the what data member of the new message object\\nto the value of the command parameter. As you\\'ve seen, it\\'s the value of what\\nthat\\'s used by MessageReceived():\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WAGER_MSG:\\n// handle message;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nA message always has a command constant, and it may include data. Regardless of\\nwhether a message holds data, it\\'s posted to a looper, and dispatched to a handler, in the same way. The firstRaceWagerMsg consists of nothing more than a\\ncommand constant, but it is nonetheless a complete message. So before increasing the complexity of message-related discussions by examining how data is\\nadded to and extracted from a message object, let\\'s use the simple message to see\\nhow a message is posted to a looper and then dispatched to a handler.\\nPosting and dispatching a message\\nOnce created, a message needs to be placed in the message loop of a looper\\'s\\nthread and then delivered to a handler. The looper is an object of the BLooper\\nclass or an object of a BLooper-derived class, such as the application object or a\\nwindow object. The handler is an object of the BHandler class or an object of a\\nBHandler-derived class, such as, again, the application object or a window object\\n(refer back to Figure 9-1 to see the pertinent part of the BeOS API class hierarchy). A call to PostMessage() places a message in the queue of the looper\\nwhose PostMessage() function is called, and optionally specifies the handler to\\nwhich the message is to be delivered. This BLooper member function has the following parameter list:\\nstatus_t PostMessage(BMessage\\nBHandler\\nBHandler\\n\\n*message,\\n*handler,\\n*replyHandler = NULL)\\n\\nThe first parameter, message, is the BMessage object to post. The second parameter, handler, names the target handler--the BHandler object to which the message is to be delivered. The replyHandler, which is initialized to NULL, is of\\ninterest only if the target handler object is going to reply to the message (more\\ntypically the target handler simply handles the message and doesn\\'t return any\\ntype of reply). While the poster of the message and the target of the message don\\'t\\nhave to be one and the same, they can be--as shown in this snippet (read the\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\n\"Menu Items and Message Dispatching\" sidebar for a look at how previous example projects have been doing this):\\n#define\\n\\nWAGER_MSG\\n\\n\\'wger\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\nfirstRaceWagerMsg = new BMessage(WAGER_MSG);\\n\\ntheWindow->PostMessage(firstRaceWagerMsg, theWindow);\\n\\nA posted message is placed in the looper\\'s message queue, where it takes its place\\nbehind (possibly) other messages in the queue in preparation to be delivered to\\nthe target handler object. The looper object continually checks its queue and calls\\nthe BLooper function DispatchMessage() for the next message in the queue.\\nWhen your posted message becomes the next in the queue, the looper invokes\\nDispatchMessage() to pass the message to the target handler. The effect is for\\nthe posted message to reach the target handler\\'s MessageReceived() function. If\\nthat routine has a case label that matches the message\\'s what data member, the\\nhandler acts on the message. Since the above code names a window as both the\\nlooper and the target handler, the window must have a MessageReceived()\\nfunction set up to take care of a message of type WAGER_MSG (if it doesn\\'t, the program won\\'t fail--the posted message simply isn\\'t acted upon):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WAGER_MSG:\\n// handle message;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe BLooper class provides another way to call PostMessage()--a sort of shorthand method that in many cases saves you the (admittedly simple) step of creating a BMessage object. Instead of passing a BMessage object as the first\\nPostMessage() parameter, simply pass the command constant that represents the\\ntype of message to be posted. Here\\'s how a WAGER_MSG could be posted:\\ntheWindow->PostMessage(WAGER_MSG, theWindow);\\n\\nWhen a command constant is passed in place of a BMessage object, the\\nPostMessage() function takes it upon itself to do the work of creating the\\nBMessage object and initializing the new object\\'s what data member to the value\\nof the passed command constant. This method of invoking PostMessage() is\\nacceptable only when the message to be created contains no data (other than the\\ncommand constant itself). If a posted message object is to include additional data,\\nthen PostMessage() won\\'t know how to add it to the newly created message\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nMenu Items and Message Dispatching\\nThe code in this section shows that the poster of the message and the target of\\nthe message can be the same object. You\\'ve already seen this situation several\\ntimes when working with menus, though the comparison may not be immediately noticeable. When a new menu item is created and added to a menu, a\\nnew BMessage object is created and associated with the new menu item:\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_OPEN_MSG\\n\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\n\\n\\'open\\'\\n\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nmenuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\", new BMessage(MENU_OPEN_MSG));\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem);\\n\\nWhen the user selects the Open menu item, the MENU_OPEN_MSG message is\\nsent to the message loop of the window that holds the menu item. No call to\\nPostMessage() is needed, as the system implicitly dispatches the message by\\nway of a call to DispatchMessage(). By default, the BMenuItem constructor\\nhas made this same window the handler of this message, so the message typically gets dispatched to the MessageReceived() function of the window\\n(though it could end up going to a hook function if the menu item message\\nwas a system message such as B_QUIT_REQUESTED):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_OPEN_MSG:\\n// open a file;\\nbreak;\\n...\\n}\\n}\\n\\nWhile the system takes care of menu handling without your code needing to\\ninclude an explicit call to PostMessage(), the effect is the same.\\nWhile the target handler for a menu item-associated message is the window\\nthat holds the menu, you can change this default condition. A BMenuItem is\\nderived from the BInvoker class (a simple class that creates objects that can\\nbe invoked to send a message to a target), so you can call the BInvoker function SetTarget() to make the change. After the following call, an Open menu\\nitem selection will send a MENU_OPEN_MSG to the application\\'s version of\\nMessageReceived() rather than to the window\\'s version of this function:\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(be_app);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nobject. Working with more complex messages--messages that hold data--is the\\nsubject of the next section.\\nMessage-posting example project\\nThe WindowMessage1 project demonstrates one way to stagger windows. Moving\\nwindows about the screen is a trivial task that doesn\\'t necessarily require the use\\nof messages. That\\'s all the better reason to choose this chore for a message-related\\nexample--it lets me concentrate on working with messages rather than on solving\\na difficult problem!\\nA new WindowMessage1 window has a File menu that consists of a single item: a\\nNew item that creates a new window. The program begins by opening a single\\nwindow near the upper-left corner of the screen. When the user chooses New\\nfrom the File menu, all open windows jump 30 pixels down and 30 pixels to the\\nright of their current locations. Thus, if a user chooses New a number of times\\n(without moving the windows as they\\'re created), the windows end up staggered\\n(as shown in Figure 9-5) rather than piled up like cards in a deck.\\n\\nFigure 9-5. The staggered windows of the WindowMessage1 program\\n\\nThe WindowMessage1 project defines two application-defined message constants.\\nA message of type MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG is implicitly generated whenever the\\nuser selects the New menu item. A message of type MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG is explicitly posted as a part of carrying out a New menu item selection:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG\\nMOVE_WINDOWS_MSG\\n\\n\\'nwwd\\'\\n\\'anwd\\'\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor adds a menubar with the single menu to a new\\nwindow. The AddItem() function that adds the menu item is responsible for associating a BMessage of type MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG with the menu item:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nframe.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nframe.top += MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nfMyView = new MyDrawView(frame, \"MyDrawView\");\\nAddChild(fMyView);\\nBMenu\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"New Window\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nEach time the New menu item is selected, a copy of the menu item\\'s message is\\ncreated. A message object of this type consists of nothing more than the message\\nconstant MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG. The new message object is sent to the message\\'s handler. By default, this handler is the window the menu item appears in.\\nSo it is the MessageReceived() function of the MyHelloWindow class that\\nbecomes responsible for handling the message generated by a New menu item\\nselection:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG, be_app);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIf I wanted the New menu item to simply create a new MyHelloWindow, I could\\ndo that with just a few lines of code. But besides creating a new window, the handling of this menu item choice might affect a number of existing windows. Keeping track of the windows that are currently open is the responsibility of the\\nBApplication object, so I create a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG and pass it to the application as a means of signaling the application to offset each open window. Including the message constant MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG in the call to PostMessage() tells\\nthis routine to create a new message object and assign the message constant\\nMOVE_WINDOWS_MSG to the new message object\\'s what data member. Since my\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nmessages of type MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG won\\'t contain any additional data, this\\nmessage-creation shortcut is appropriate. The new message object is then posted\\nto the application object (per the second PostMessage() parameter).\\nThe MyHelloApplication class is to handle application-defined messages, so the\\nclass now needs to override MessageReceived(). Since the program allows multiple windows and doesn\\'t keep constant track of which window is active, the\\nMyHelloWindow data member fMyWindow that appears in similar examples has\\nbeen eliminated:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe MyHelloApplication version of MessageReceived() uses the Chapter 4\\nmethod of repeatedly calling the BApplication function WindowAt() to gain a\\nreference to each currently open window. Once found, a window is moved by\\ninvoking the BWindow function MoveBy(). After all existing windows have been\\nmoved, a new window is opened near the upper-left corner of the screen.\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG:\\nBWindow *oldWindow;\\ni = 0;\\nwhile (oldWindow = WindowAt(i++)) {\\n}\\nBRect\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\ntheRect;\\n*newWindow;\\n\\nnewWindow = new MyHelloWindow(theRect);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\ninherited::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nThe BApplication function WindowAt() returns a BWindow object--so that\\'s\\nwhat I\\'ve declared oldWindow to be. The only action I take with the returned window is to call the BWindow function MoveBy(). If I needed to perform some\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nMyHelloWindow-specific action on the window (for instance, if the\\nMyHelloWindow class defined a member function that needed to be invoked),\\nthen I\\'d first need to typecast oldWindow to a MyHelloWindow object.\\nAdding and retrieving message data\\nA number of BMessage member functions make it possible to easily add information to any application-defined message object. The prototypes for several of these\\nroutines are listed here:\\nstatus_t AddBool(const char\\nbool\\n\\n*name,\\naBool)\\n\\nstatus_t AddInt32(const char\\n\\n*name,\\n\\nstatus_t AddFloat(const char\\nfloat\\n\\n*name,\\naFloat)\\n\\nstatus_t AddRect(const char\\nBRect\\n\\n*name,\\nrect)\\n\\nstatus_t AddString(const char\\nconst char\\n\\n*name,\\n*string)\\n\\nstatus_t AddPointer(const char\\nconst void\\n\\n*name,\\n*pointer)\\n\\nTo add data to a message, create the message object and then invoke the\\nBMessage function suitable to the type of data to add to the message object. The\\nfollowing snippet adds a pair of numbers, each stored as a 32-bit integer, to a\\nmessage:\\n#define\\nBMessage\\n\\nHI_LOW_SCORE_MSG\\n\\n\\'hilo\\'\\n\\n*currentScoreMsg = new BMessage(HI_LO_SCORE_MSG);\\nhighScore = 96;\\nlowScore = 71;\\n\\n\\nAfter the above code executes, a new message object exists--one that is referenced by the variable currentScoreMsg. This message has a what data member\\nvalue of HI_LO_SCORE_MSG, and holds integers with values of 96 and 71.\\nFor each Add function, the BMessage class defines a Find function. Each Find\\nfunction is used to extract one piece of information from a message:\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindBool(const char *name,\\nbool\\n*value) const;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindInt32(const char *name,\\n*val) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindFloat(const char *name,\\nfloat\\n*f) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindRect(const char *name,\\nBRect\\n*rect) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindString(const char *name,\\nconst char **str) const;\\n\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindPointer(const char *name,\\nvoid\\n**ptr) const;\\n\\nTo make use of data in a message, the originating object creates the message,\\ninvokes Add functions to add the data, and posts the message using\\nPostMessage(). The receiving object invokes Find functions to extract any or all\\nof the message\\'s data from the object that receives the message.\\nData added to a message always has both a name and a type. These traits alone\\nare usually enough to extract the data--it\\'s not your program\\'s responsibility to\\nkeep track of data ordering in a message object (the exception being arrays, which\\nare covered just ahead). To access the two integers stored in the previous snippet\\'s currentScoreMsg message object, use this code:\\n\\nhighestValue;\\nlowestValue;\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s worthwhile to note that when adding data to a message, you can use the same\\nname and datatype for more than one piece of information. For instance, two high\\nscore values could be saved in one message object as follows:\\n\\nIn such a situation, an array of the appropriate datatype (32-bit integers in this\\nexample) is set up and the values are inserted into the array in the order they are\\nadded to the message. As expected, array element indices begin at 0. There is a\\nsecond version of each Find routine, one that has an index parameter for finding\\na piece of information that is a part of an array. For instance, the FindInt32()\\nfunction used for accessing an array element looks like this:\\nstatus_t\\n\\nFindInt32(const char *name,\\nindex,\\n*val) const;\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nTo access an array element, include the index argument. Here the value of 96 (the\\nsecond element, with an index of 1) is being retrieved from the\\ncurrentScoreMsg message:\\n\\nsecondHighValue;\\n\\n\\nMake sure to check out the BMessage class description in the Application Kit\\nchapter of the Be Book. There you\\'ll find descriptions for other Add and Find routines, such as AddInt16() and FindPoint(). You\\'ll also see the other variants of\\neach of the Add and Find routines I\\'ve listed. The Be Book also discusses the universal, or generic, AddData() member function. You can optionally use this routine in place of any of the type-specific functions (such as AddInt32() or\\nAddFloat()) or for adding data of an application-defined type to a message\\nobject.\\nMessage data example project\\nThe WindowMessage2 project does the same thing as the WindowMessage1\\nproject--it offsets all open windows when a new window is opened. Like\\nWindowMessage1, this latest project uses messages to carry out its task. Let\\'s look\\nat the different approach used by the two projects.\\nRecall that when the WindowMessage1 program opened a new window, the active\\nwindow created a single message and sent it to the application object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function. It was then the responsibility of the application\\nobject to locate and move each window. The application did that by looping\\nthrough the window list and calling MoveBy() for each window it encountered.\\nIn the WindowMessage2 program, the active window\\'s MessageReceived() function cycles through the window list. When a window is encountered, a reference\\nto it is stored as data in a message, and that message is posted to the application.\\nWhen the application object\\'s MessageReceived() function gets the message, it\\nretrieves the window reference and moves that one window. Thus the window\\nthat holds the selected New menu item may generate numerous messages (one for\\neach window that\\'s already open). The WindowMessage1 project may have acted\\na little more efficiently, but WindowMessage2 gives me the opportunity to post a\\nslew of messages! It also gives me an excuse to store some data in each message--something the WindowMessage1 project didn\\'t do.\\nWindowMessage2 defines the same two application-defined messages as the\\nWindowMessage1 project--a MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG issued by a selection of the\\nNew menu item, and a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG created by the window and sent to\\nthe application. This latest version of the MyHelloWindow constructor is identical\\nto the version in the WindowMessage1 project--refer back to that example to see\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nthe listing. The MyHelloWindow version of MessageReceived(), however, is different. Instead of simply creating a new MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG and sending it to the\\napplication, this function now repeatedly calls the BApplication function\\nWindowAt(). For each open window, the loop creates a new message, adds a\\nwindow reference to the message, and posts the message to the application:\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MENU_NEW_WINDOW_MSG:\\nBRect\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBWindow\\nBMessage\\n\\ntheRect;\\n*newWindow;\\n*oldWindow;\\ni = 0;\\n*newWindowMsg;\\n\\nwhile (oldWindow = be_app->WindowAt(i++)) {\\nnewWindowMsg = new BMessage(MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG);\\nnewWindowMsg->AddPointer(\"Old Window\", oldWindow);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(newWindowMsg, be_app);\\n}\\nnewWindow = new MyHelloWindow(theRect);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nEach posted MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG message has the application as the designated\\nhandler. When a message reaches the application object, that object\\'s\\nMessageReceived() function calls FindPointer() to access the window of\\ninterest. The BMessage function name (FindPointer()), along with the data\\nname (\"Old Window\"), indicates that the message object data should be searched\\nfor a pointer stored under the name \"Old Window.\" Of course, in this example,\\nthat one piece of information is the only data stored in a MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG message, but the technique applies to messages of any size. A window object is a\\npointer, so the returned value can be used as is--a call to the BWindow function\\nMoveBy() is all that\\'s needed to relocate the window:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase MOVE_WINDOWS_MSG:\\nBWindow *theWindow;\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nmessage->FindPointer(\"Old Window\", &theWindow);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nIf you enable the debugger and run the program, you might be able\\nto see multithreading in action. If you set a breakpoint in the\\nMyHelloApplication version of MessageReceived(), you\\'ll note\\nthat, as expected, the function gets called once for each already\\nopen window. You may be surprised to see the new window open\\nbefore the last of the already opened windows is moved. With several windows open, a number of messages are posted to the application. One by one the application pulls these messages from its\\nqueue and handles each by moving one window. While that\\'s going\\non, the code that creates the new window may very well execute.\\n\\nA second message data example project\\nThe previous two projects both relied on the user making a menu selection to\\ntrigger the posting of a message to the application object--it was a menu itemgenerated message handled in a window\\'s MessageReceived() function that in\\nturn created another message. While it may in fact be a menu item selection or\\nother user action that causes your program to create still another message, this\\ndoesn\\'t have to be the case. The stimulus may be an event unrelated to any direct\\naction by the user that causes your program to create and post a message. Here, in\\nthe AlertMessage project, the launching of an application may result in that program creating a message.\\nAll Be applications can be launched by either double-clicking on the program\\'s\\nicon or by typing the program\\'s name from the command line. Like any of the\\nexamples in this book, the AlertMessage program can be launched by opening a\\nterminal window: run the Terminal application from the Tracker\\'s app menu,\\nmove to the directory that holds the AlertMessage program, and type the program\\nname. Regardless of whether AlertMessage launches from the desktop or from the\\ncommand line, a single window opens. If the program starts up from the command line, however, the option exists to choose the number of windows that will\\nautomatically open. To take advantage of this option, the user need simply follow\\nthe program name with a space and the desired number of windows. Figure 9-6\\nshows how I worked my way into the folder that holds my copy of AlertMessage,\\nand how I then indicated that the program should start with three windows open.\\nThe AlertMessage program allows at most five windows to be opened at application launch. If you launch AlertMessage from the command line and enter a value\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nFigure 9-6. Launching the AlertMessage program from the command line\\n\\ngreater than 5, the program will execute, but only five windows will open. In such\\na case, the program gives the user an indication of what happened by displaying\\nan alert like the one shown in Figure 9-7.\\n\\nFigure 9-7. The windows of the AlertMessage program\\n\\nThe alert in Figure 9-7 is displayed thanks to a message the application posts to\\nitself. When the AlertMessage program launches from the command line, a check\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nis made to see if the user-specified window value is greater than 5. If it is, an\\napplication-defined WINDOW_MAX_MSG is created:\\n#define\\n\\nWINDOW_MAX_MSG\\n\\n\\'wdmx\\'\\n\\nBMessage\\n\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\n\\nThe WindowMessage2 project demonstrated how to add a pointer to a message.\\nHere you see how to add a Boolean value and a string. The means are BMessage\\nAdd functions--data of other types is added in a similar manner:\\nbool\\nconst char\\n\\nbeepOnce = true;\\n*alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\n\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"Alert String\", alertString);\\n\\nThe beepOnce variable will be used to specify whether or not a beep should\\naccompany the display of the alert. The alertString holds the text to be displayed. Once created and set up, the message is posted to the application:\\nbe_app->PostMessage(maxWindowsMsg, be_app);\\n\\nPostMessage() specifies that the application be the message handler, so it\\'s the\\napplication object\\'s version of MessageReceived() that gets this WINDOW_MAX_\\nMSG message:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch (message->what) {\\ncase WINDOW_MAX_MSG:\\nbool\\nbeepOnce;\\nconst char *alertString;\\nBAlert\\n*alert;\\nlong\\nresult;\\nbeepOnce = message->FindBool(\"Beep\");\\nalertString = message->FindString(\"Alert String\");\\nif (beepOnce)\\nbeep();\\nalert = new BAlert(\"MaxWindowAlert\", alertString, \"OK\");\\nresult = alert->Go();\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nMessageReceived() handles the message by first accessing its data. If beepOnce\\nis true, a system beep is sounded. The text of the string alertString is used as\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nthe text displayed in the alert (refer to Chapter 4 for information about alerts and\\nthe BAlert class).\\nAlertMessage is this book\\'s first example that uses a command-line argument in\\nthe launching of a program, so a little extra explanation on how a program\\nreceives and responds to such input is in order.\\nCommand-line arguments\\nAn application message (a system message that affects the application itself rather\\nthan one particular window) is both received and handled by a program\\'s\\nBApplication object. A B_ARGV_RECEIVED message is such an application message. When a program is launched with one or more arguments from the command line, a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message is delivered to the application. Unlike\\nmost application messages, a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message holds data. In particular, it holds two pieces of data. The first, argc, is an integer that specifies how\\nmany arguments the program receives. The second, argv, is an array that holds\\nthe actual arguments. Because the program name itself is considered an argument, the value of argc will be one greater than the number of arguments the\\nuser typed. The array argv will thus always have as its first element the string that\\nis the name of the program. Consider the case of the user launching the justdiscussed AlertMessage program as follows:\\n$ AlertMessage 4\\n\\nHere the value of argc will be 2. The string in argv[0] will be \"AlertMessage\"\\nprefaced with the pathname, while the string in argv[1] will be \"4\". Because all\\narguments are stored as strings, you\\'ll need to convert strings to numbers as necessary. Here I\\'m using the atoi() string-to-integer function from the standard C++\\nlibrary to convert the above user-entered argument from the string \"4\" to the integer 4:\\n\\nThe fact that the program\\'s path is included as part of the program\\nname in the string argv[0] is noteworthy if you\\'re interested in\\ndetermining the program\\'s name (remember--from the desktop the\\nuser is free to change the name of your application!). If the user is\\nkeeping the AlertMessage program in the computer\\'s root directory,\\nand launches it from the command line while in a subdirectory, the\\nvalue of argv[0] will be \"/root/AlertMessage\". If your program is to\\nderive its own name from argv[0], it should strip off leading characters up to and including the final \"/\" character.\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nWhen a program receives a B_ARGV_RECEIVED message, it dispatches it to its\\nArgvReceived() function. I\\'ve yet to discuss this BApplication member function because up to this point none of my example projects have had a provision\\nfor handling user input at application launch. The AlertMessage program does\\naccept such input, so its application object needs to override this routine:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage* message);\\nArgvReceived(int32 argc, char **argv);\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe program relies on a number of constants in opening each window. WINDOW_\\nWIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT define the size of each window. WINDOW_1_LEFT and\\nWINDOW_1_TOP establish the screen position of the first window. The two offset\\nconstants establish how each subsequent window is to be staggered from the previously opened window:\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nWINDOW_WIDTH\\nWINDOW_HEIGHT\\nWINDOW_H_OFFSET\\nWINDOW_V_OFFSET\\n\\n\\nRegardless of whether the user launches AlertMessage from the desktop or from\\nthe shell, one window is always opened. The AlertMessage version of\\nArgvReceived() looks at the value the user typed in following the program\\nname and uses that number to determine how many additional windows to open.\\nArgvReceived() thus opens the user-entered value of windows, less one. Before\\ndoing that, however, the user\\'s value is checked to verify that it doesn\\'t exceed\\n5--the maximum number of windows AlertMessage allows. If the value is greater\\nthan 5, ArgvReceived() creates a WINDOW_MAX_MSG, supplies this message with\\nsome data, and posts the message. After posting the message, the number of windows to open is set to the maximum of 5:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::ArgvReceived(int32 argc, char **argv)\\n{\\nif (userNumWindows > 5) {\\nbool\\nbeepOnce = true;\\nconst char *alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\nBMessage\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"AlertString\", alertString);\\nbe_app->PostMessage(maxWindowsMsg, be_app);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nuserNumWindows = 5;\\n}\\nBRect\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nfloat\\nMyHelloWindow\\n\\naRect;\\nleft = WINDOW_1_LEFT + WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\nright = left + WINDOW_WIDTH;\\ntop = WINDOW_1_TOP + WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\nbottom = top + WINDOW_HEIGHT;\\n*theWindow;\\ni;\\n\\nfor (i = 2; i <= userNumWindows; i++) {\\naRect.Set(left, top, right, bottom);\\ntheWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\nleft\\n+= WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\nright += WINDOW_H_OFFSET;\\ntop\\n+= WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\nbottom += WINDOW_V_OFFSET;\\n}\\n}\\n\\nAs mentioned in the description of the AlertMessage project, a posted WINDOW_\\nMAX_MSG is handled by the application object\\'s MessageReceived() function.\\nThere the message data is accessed and an alert posted.\\nAdding data of any type to a message\\nThe BMessage Add routines, such as AddBool() and AddString(), serve as a\\nsort of shorthand notation for the more generic BMessage function AddData().\\nAddData() can be used to add data of any type to a message. Thus, AddData()\\ncan be used to add data of an application-defined type, or data of any of the types\\nthat can be added using a specific Add function. Here\\'s the declaration for\\nAddData():\\nstatus_t AddData(const char\\ntype_code\\nconst void\\nssize_t\\nbool\\n\\n*name,\\ntype,\\n*data,\\nnumBytes,\\nfixedSize = true,\\nnumItems = 1)\\n\\nThe name and data parameters serve the same purposes as their counterparts in\\nthe other Add routines--name serves as an identifier that\\'s used when later accessing the data through the use of a Find function, while data holds the data itself.\\nUnlike most Add functions, though, in AddData() the data parameter is a pointer\\nto the data rather than the data itself.\\nBecause AddData() can accept data of any type, you need to specify both the\\nkind of data to add and the size, in bytes, of data that is to be added. Use the\\nappropriate Be-defined type constant for the type parameter. The third column of\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nTable 9-1 lists these constants for commonly used Add routines--make sure to turn\\nto the BMessage class description in the Application Kit chapter of the Be Book\\nfor more Add routines and corresponding type constants.\\nTable 9-1.

Both\\nthese parameters help AddData() work with data more efficiently. If the array is\\nto hold items that are identical in size (such as an array of integers), pass true for\\nfixedSize. If you have an idea of how many items will eventually be in the\\narray, pass that value as numItems. An inaccurate value for numItems just diminishes slightly the efficiency with which AddData() utilizes memory--it won\\'t\\ncause the routine to fail.\\nThe just-described AlertMessage example project created a message object and\\nadded a bool value and a string to that message:\\nbool\\nconst char\\nBMessage\\n\\nbeepOnce = true;\\n*alertString = \"Maximum windows open\";\\n*maxWindowsMsg = new BMessage(WINDOW_MAX_MSG);\\n\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddBool(\"Beep\", beepOnce);\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddString(\"AlertString\", alertString);\\n\\nBecause AddBool() and AddString() are simply data-type \"tuned\" versions of\\nAddData(), I could have added the data using two calls to AddData(). To do\\nthat, I\\'d replace the last two lines in the above snippet with this code:\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddData(\"Beep\", B_BOOL_TYPE, &beepOnce, sizeof(bool));\\nmaxWindowsMsg->AddData(\"AlertString\", B_STRING_TYPE,\\nalertString, strlen(alertString));\\n\\nAddData() accepts a pointer to the data to add, so the bool variable beepOnce is\\nnow prefaced with the \"address of\" operator. The string alertString is already\\nin the form of a pointer (char *), so it can be passed as it was for AddString().\\nAs shown in the above snippet, if you\\'re adding a bool value, pass B_BOOL_TYPE\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\n\\nas the second AddData() parameter. You generally determine the size of the data\\nto add through the standard library function sizeof() or, as in the case of a\\nstring, the strlen() routine.\\nLike the other Add functions, AddData() has a companion Find function--\\nFindData(). Here\\'s that routine\\'s prototype:\\nstatus_t FindData(const char\\ntype_code\\nconst void\\nssize_t\\n\\n*name,\\ntype,\\n**data,\\n*numBytes)\\n\\nFindData() searches a message for data that is of the type specified by the type\\nparameter and that is stored under the name specified by the name parameter.\\nWhen it finds it, it stores a pointer to it in the data parameter, and returns the\\nnumber of bytes the data consists of in the numBytes parameter. An example of\\nthe use of FindData() appears next.\\nData, messages, and the clipboard\\nEarlier in this chapter, I discussed the clipboard, but held off on presenting an\\nexample project. Here\\'s why: the clipboard holds its data in a BMessage object,\\nand the details of accessing message data weren\\'t revealed until well past this\\nchapter\\'s first mention of the clipboard. Now that you\\'ve been introduced to the\\nclipboard and have a background in BMessage basics, working with the clipboard will seem simple.\\nThe clipboard is represented by a BClipboard object that includes a data member that is a BMessage object. Items on the clipboard are all stored as separate\\ndata in this single clipboard message object. This is generally of little importance\\nto you because most program interaction with the clipboard is transparent. For\\ninstance, when you set up a Paste menu item, the B_PASTE message is associated\\nwith the menu item, and your work to support pasting is finished. Here\\'s the pertinent code:\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Paste\", new BMessage(B_PASTE), \\'V\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\n\\nIf your program has cause to add data to, or retrieve data from, the clipboard by\\nmeans other than the standard Be-defined messages, it can. Only then is it important to understand how to interact with the clipboard\\'s data.\\nBecause the clipboard object can be accessed from any number of objects\\n(belonging to your application or to any other running application), the potential\\nfor clipboard data to be accessed by two threads at the same time exists. Clipboard access provides a specific example of locking and unlocking an object, the\\ntopic discussed in this chapter\\'s \"Messaging\" section. Before working with the clipboard, call the BClipboard function Lock() to prevent other access by other\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nthreads (if the clipboard is in use by another thread when your thread calls\\nLock(), your thread will wait until clipboard access becomes available). When finished, open up clipboard access by other threads by calling the BClipboard function Unlock():\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\n// access clipboard data here\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nThe global clipboard is typically used to hold a single item--the most recent item\\ncopied by the user. Adding a new item generally overwrites the current item\\n(which could be any manner of data, including that copied from a different application). If your thread is adding data to the clipboard, it should first clear out the\\nexisting clipboard contents. The BClipboard function Clear() does that. After\\nadding its own data, your thread needs to call the BClipboard function Commit()\\nto confirm that this indeed is the action to perform. So while the above snippet\\nworks fine for retrieving clipboard data, it should be expanded a bit for adding\\ndata to the clipboard:\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\n// add clipboard data here\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nTo actually access the clipboard\\'s data, call the BClipboard function Data(). This\\nfunction obtains a BMessage object that you use to reference the clipboard\\'s data.\\nThis next snippet shows that here you don\\'t use new to create the message--the\\nData() function returns the clipboard\\'s data-holding message:\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\nAt this point, clipboard data can be accessed using BMessage functions such as\\nAddData() and FindData(). Here the text \"Testing123\" replaces whatever currently resides on the clipboard:\\nconst char *theString = \"Testing123\";\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nclipMessage->AddData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, theString,\\nstrlen(theString));\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nThe clipboard exists for data exchange--including interapplication exchange. So\\nyou might not be surprised to see that MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) may be involved in clipboard usage. When you pass AddData() a type\\nparameter of B_MIME_TYPE, you\\'re specifying that the data to be added is of the\\nMIME main type and subtype listed in the name parameter. For adding text, use\\ntext as the main type and plain as the subtype--resulting in \"text/plain\" as the\\nfirst AddData() parameter.\\nTo retrieve data from the clipboard, use the BMessage function FindData(). This\\nsnippet brings whatever text is currently on the clipboard into a string variable\\nnamed clipString. It also returns the number of bytes of returned text in the\\nvariable numBytes:\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nBMessage\\nconst char\\nssize_t\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n*clipString;\\nnumBytes;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\nclipMessage->FindData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, &clipString, &numBytes);\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\n\\nClipboard example project\\nThe ClipboardMessage project provides a simple example of adding text to the\\nclipboard. This project adds just a few changes to the Chapter 8 project TextViewEdit. Recall that TextViewEdit displayed a window that included a single\\nmenu with a Test item that sounds the system beep, and the four standard textediting items. The window also included one BTextView object. Figure 9-8 shows\\nthat for the new ClipboardMessage project a new Add String menu item has been\\nadded. Choosing Add String clears the clipboard and places the text \"Testing123\"\\non it. Subsequent pastes (whether performed by choosing the Paste menu item or\\nby pressing Command-v) place this string at the insertion point in the window\\'s\\ntext view object.\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor associates a new application-defined message\\nconstant, ADD_STR_MSG, with the new Add String menu item. Except for the new\\nAddItem() line before the call to Show(), the MyHelloWindow constructor is\\n\\x0cApplication-Defined Messages\\n\\n\\nFigure 9-8. The window of the ClipboardMessage program\\n\\nidentical to the version used in the Chapter 8 TextViewEdit project on which this\\nnew project is based, so only a part of the constructor is shown here:\\n#define\\n\\nADD_STR_MSG\\n\\n\\'adst\\'\\n\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\n...\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Select All\",\\nnew BMessage(B_SELECT_ALL), \\'A\\'));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(NULL, this);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Add String\",\\nnew BMessage(ADD_STR_MSG)));\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe MessageReceived() function holds the new clipboard code. Selecting Add\\nString locks and clears the clipboard, accesses the clipboard data-holding message, adds a string to the clipboard, commits that addition, then unlocks the clipboard for use by other threads. Here\\'s MessageReceived() in its entirety (recall\\nthat the text-editing commands B_CUT, B_COPY, B_PASTE, and B_SELECT_ALL are\\nstandard messages that are automatically handled by the system):\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase ADD_STR_MSG:\\nconst char *theString = \"Testing123\";\\nbe_clipboard->Lock();\\nbe_clipboard->Clear();\\nBMessage\\n\\n*clipMessage;\\n\\nclipMessage = be_clipboard->Data();\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 9: Messages and Threads\\nclipMessage->AddData(\"text/plain\", B_MIME_TYPE, theString,\\nstrlen(theString));\\nbe_clipboard->Commit();\\nbe_clipboard->Unlock();\\nbreak;\\ncase TEST_MSG:\\nbeep();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cIn this chapter:\\n Files and the Storage\\nKit\\n Using Standard Open\\nand Save Panels\\n Onward\\n\\n10.\\n\\nFiles\\n\\nMany utility programs don\\'t involve file handling, but almost all real-world, fullfeatured applications do. Before your own best-selling Be application can be considered complete, it will no doubt need to have the capability to open files, save\\nfiles, or both. In this chapter, you\\'ll see how these file-handling techniques are\\nimplemented. To open a file, your program will need to find it on disk; and to\\nsave a file, your program will need to specify a location on disk. So before getting\\ninto the actual manipulation of files, this chapter introduces you to the BeOS file\\nhierarchy.\\n\\nFiles and the Storage Kit\\nUp to this point, we\\'ve managed to avoid the Storage Kit. Now that we\\'re about to\\nwork with persistent data, though, it\\'s time to dig into a number of the classes in\\nthis useful kit. The classes of the Storage Kit allow you to write programs that recognize the hierarchy of files on disk, read from and write to files, and study or\\nchange file attributes.\\nThere are a number of Storage Kit classes that aid in working with files, including,\\nunsurprisingly, the BFile class. But Be also tips its hat to Unix programmers by\\nsupporting standard POSIX file functions such as open(), close(), read(), and\\nwrite(). If you have a Unix programming background, you\\'ll feel right at home\\nusing POSIX functions to implement file-handling tasks such as saving a document\\'s data to a file. If you aren\\'t comfortable with Unix, you probably aren\\'t\\nfamiliar with POSIX. That\\'s okay, because the Storage Kit also defines classes (such\\nas BFile) that let you work with files outside the realm of POSIX. In this chapter\\nI\\'ll cover file manipulation using both techniques.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nPOSIX, or Portable Operating System Interface for Unix, is a standard\\ndeveloped so that buyers (particularly the U.S. government) could be\\nassured of purchasing programs that ran on a variety of systems and\\nconfigurations. A POSIX-compliant program is written to a strict standard so that it is easily ported. It\\'s also designed to run on any\\nPOSIX-compliant operating system, which includes most variants of\\nUnix.\\n\\nFile Organization\\nThe BeOS, like the Mac OS, Windows, and Unix, organizes files hierarchically.\\nFiles, and the directories (or folders) that hold files, are organized in a hierarchy or\\ntree. Each directory may hold files, other directories, or both. Each item (file or\\ndirectory) has a single parent directory--a directory in which the item resides. The\\nparent directory of an item may, of course, have a parent of its own. Thus the creation of a hierarchy. The common ancestor for all the files and directories in the\\nhierarchy is a directory referred to as the root directory.\\nA single file, regardless of its place in the hierarchy, is considered to have both an\\nentry and a node. In short, a file\\'s entry is its pathname, or location in the hierarchy, while the file\\'s node is the actual data that makes up the file. These two parts\\nof a file serve different purposes, and one part can be manipulated without affecting the other part. For instance, a file\\'s entry (its pathname) can be altered without changing the file\\'s node (its contents, or data).\\nEntries\\nSearching, opening, and saving a file all involve an entry. Your program needs to\\nknow, or establish, the location of a file before it can work with it. The entry_\\nref data structure is used to keep track of the entry, or entries, your program is to\\nwork with. A Be program relies on an object of the BEntry class if it needs to\\nmanipulate an entry. In this chapter, you\\'ll see examples that use both the entry_\\nref data structure and the BEntry class.\\nNodes\\nTo manipulate a file\\'s contents--something done during reading and writing a\\nfile--a program works with the file\\'s node. For this purpose, the BeOS defines a\\nnode_ref data structure and a BNode class. The BFile class is derived from\\nBNode, and it is the BFile class that I\\'ll use in this chapter\\'s examples.\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\nAn operating system with a graphical user interface typically provides standardized means for opening and saving files. That maintains consistency from program to program, and allows the user to work intuitively with files regardless of\\nthe program being used. The BeOS is no exception. In Figure 10-1, you see the\\nstandard Save file panel. The Open file panel looks similar to the Save file panel,\\nwith the primary difference being the Open file panel\\'s omission of the text view\\nused in the Save file panel to provide a name for a file.\\n\\nFigure 10-1. The standard Save file panel\\n\\nUsing BFilePanel to Create a Panel\\nThe Storage Kit defines a single BFilePanel class that\\'s used to create both a\\nSave file panel object and an Open file panel object. The BFilePanel constructor, shown below, is a bit scary-looking, but as you\\'ll soon see, most of the arguments can be ignored and left at their default values:\\nBFilePanel(file_panel_mode\\nBMessenger\\nentry_ref\\nbool\\nBMessage\\nBRefFilter\\nbool\\nbool\\n\\nmode = B_OPEN_PANEL,\\n*target = NULL,\\n*start_directory = NULL,\\nnode_flavors = 0,\\nallow_multiple_selection = true,\\n*message = NULL,\\n*filter = NULL,\\nmodal = false,\\nhide_when_done = true);\\n\\nOf the numerous arguments, by far the one of most importance is the first--mode.\\nThe type of panel the BFilePanel constructor creates is established by the value\\nof mode. Once a BFilePanel object is created, there\\'s no way to change its type,\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nso you need to know in advance what purpose the panel is to serve. To specify\\nthat the new BFilePanel object be a Save file panel, pass the Be-defined constant B_SAVE_PANEL:\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\nsavePanel = new BFilePanel(B_SAVE_PANEL);\\n\\nTo instead specify that the new object be an Open file panel, pass the Be-defined\\nconstant B_OPEN_PANEL. Or, simply omit the parameter completely and rely on\\nthe default value for this argument (see the above constructor definition):\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\nfOpenPanel = new BFilePanel();\\n\\nCreating a new panel doesn\\'t display it. This allows your program to create the\\npanel at any time, then display it only in response to the user\\'s request. For an\\nOpen file panel, that\\'s typically when the user chooses the Open item from the\\nFile menu. For the Save file panel, the display of the panel comes when the user\\nchooses the Save As item from the File menu. In response to the message issued\\nby the system to the appropriate MessageReceived() function, your program will\\ninvoke the BFilePanel function Show(), as done here for the fOpenPanel\\nobject:\\nfOpenPanel->Show();\\n\\nAssuming you follow normal conventions, the files shown are the contents of the\\ncurrent working directory. When a panel is displayed, control is in the hands of\\nthe user. Once the user confirms a choice (whether it\\'s a file selection in the Open\\nfile panel, a click on the Save button in the Save file panel, or a click on the Cancel button in either type of panel), a message is automatically sent by the system\\nto the panel\\'s target. By default the panel\\'s target is the application object, but this\\ncan be changed (either in the BFilePanel constructor or by invoking the panel\\nobject\\'s SetTarget() function). The message holds information about the\\nselected file or files (for an Open file panel) or about the file that\\'s to be created\\nand used to hold a document\\'s data (for a Save file panel). The details of how to\\nhandle the message generated in response to a user\\'s dismissing a panel appear in\\nthe next sections.\\n\\nThe File-Handling Base Project\\nIn Chapter 8, Text, you saw ScrollViewWindow, a program that displays a window with a text area that occupies the entire content area of the window. A simple text editor lends itself well to file opening and saving, so in this chapter I\\'ll\\nmodify ScrollViewWindow to make it capable of opening existing text files and\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nsaving the current document as a text file. Figure 10-2 shows the window the new\\nFileBase program displays.\\n\\nFigure 10-2. The window of the FileBase program\\n\\nWhile the FileBase program includes menu items for opening and saving files,\\nyou\\'ll soon see that the program isn\\'t up to handling those chores yet. Choosing\\nthe Open menu item displays the Open file panel, but selecting a file from the\\npanel\\'s list has no effect--the panel is simply dismissed. The Save As menu item\\ndisplays the Save file panel, but typing a name and clicking the Save button does\\nnothing more than dismiss the panel. FileBase serves as the basis (hence the\\nname) for a file-handling program. I\\'ll revise FileBase twice in this chapter: once to\\nadd file-saving abilities, and one more time to include file-opening powers. With\\nthe preliminaries taken care of here in FileBase, those two examples can focus\\nstrictly on the tasks of saving and opening a file.\\nThe Application class\\nFileBase is a spin-off of ScrollViewWindow. A quick look at how that Chapter 8\\nprogram has been enhanced makes it easier to follow the upcoming file saving\\nand opening changes. While looking over the old code, I\\'ll insert a few changes\\nhere and there to ready the program for the file-handling code. The changes begin\\nin the MyHelloApplication class definition. In any Be program, a Save file panel\\nis associated with a particular window--the user will choose Save As to save the\\ncontents of the frontmost window to a file on disk. An Open file panel, though, is\\ntypically associated with the application itself. In the MyHelloApplication class,\\na BFilePanel data member has been added to serve as the Open file panel\\nobject, while a MessageReceived() function has been added to support the handling of the message generated by the user choosing the Open menu item:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBFilePanel\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe main() function remains untouched--it still serves as the vehicle for creating\\nthe application object and starting the program running:\\nmain()\\n{\\nMyHelloApplication\\n\\n*myApplication;\\n\\nmyApplication = new MyHelloApplication();\\nmyApplication->Run();\\ndelete(myApplication);\\n}\\n\\nThe application constructor now includes the single line of code needed to create\\na new BFilePanel object. No mode parameter is passed, so by default the new\\nobject is an Open file panel. Recall that the BFilePanel constructor creates the\\npanel, but doesn\\'t display it.\\nMyHelloApplication::MyHelloApplication()\\n: BApplication(\"application/x-dps-mywd\")\\n{\\nBRect aRect;\\nfOpenPanel = new BFilePanel();\\nfMyWindow = new MyHelloWindow(aRect);\\n}\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see ahead, when the user chooses Open from the File menu, the application generates a message that\\'s delivered to the application object. Thus the need\\nfor a MessageReceived() function for the application class. Here the choosing of\\nthe Open menu item does nothing more than display the previously hidden Open\\nfile panel:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::MessageReceived(BMessage *message) {\\nswitch(message->what) {\\ncase MENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG:\\nfOpenPanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBApplication::MessageReceived(message);\\nbreak;\\n}\\n}\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nThe window class\\nThe window\\'s one menu now holds an Open item and a Save As item, so two\\nmessage constants are necessary:\\n#define\\n#define\\n\\nMENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG\\nMENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG\\n\\n\\'opEN\\'\\n\\'svAs\\'\\n\\nThe window class functions are the same, but the data members are a bit different. The Chapter 8 incarnation of the text editing program defined a BViewderived class that filled the window and contained the window\\'s text view and\\nscroll view. Here I\\'m content to place the BTextView and BScrollView objects\\ndirectly in the window\\'s top view. Thus the MyHelloWindow class doesn\\'t include\\na MyDrawView member (there is no longer a MyDrawView class), but it does\\ninclude the fTextView and fScrollView members that were formerly a part of\\nMyDrawView. The class now also defines a BFilePanel object to serve as the\\nwindow\\'s Save file panel:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhich is the better way to include views in a window--by defining\\nan all-encompassing view to nest the other views in, or by simply\\nrelying on the window\\'s top view? It\\'s partially a matter of personal\\npreference. It\\'s also a matter of whether your program will make\\nchanges that affect the look of a window\\'s background. The FileBase program won\\'t change the overall look of its window (that is, it\\nwon\\'t do something such as change the window\\'s background\\ncolor), so simply including the views in the window\\'s top view\\nmakes sense. It also allows for a good example of an alternate\\nimplementation of the Chapter 8 way of doing things!\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor begins in typical fashion with the setup of the\\nmenu and its items:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n{\\nBMenu\\nBMenuItem\\nBRect\\n\\n*menu;\\n*menuItem;\\nmenuBarRect;\\n\\nfMenuBar = new BMenuBar(menuBarRect, \"MenuBar\");\\nAddChild(fMenuBar);\\nmenu = new BMenu(\"File\");\\nfMenuBar->AddItem(menu);\\nmenu->AddItem(menuItem = new BMenuItem(\"Open\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_FILE_OPEN_MSG)));\\nmenuItem->SetTarget(be_app);\\nmenu->AddItem(new BMenuItem(\"Save As\",\\nnew BMessage(MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG)));\\n\\nIf you\\'re referencing the Chapter 8 program from which FileBase is\\nderived, you\\'ll see that the MyHelloWindow constructor just lost a\\nfew lines of code. The ScrollViewWindow version of the constructor\\nstarted with code to resize the window size-defining rectangle\\nframe. Since the FileBase window no longer includes a MyDrawView\\nunder the menubar, there\\'s no need to resize the frame such that it\\nfills the window, less the menubar area.\\n\\nThe MyHelloWindow constructor next establishes the size of the text view and the\\ntext rectangle nested in that view. The constructor creates the BTextView object,\\nmakes it a part of a BScrollView object, and then adds the scroll view to the\\nwindow:\\nBRect\\nBRect\\n\\nviewFrame;\\ntextBounds;\\n\\nviewFrame = Bounds();\\nviewFrame.top = MENU_BAR_HEIGHT + 1.0;\\nviewFrame.right -= B_V_SCROLL_BAR_WIDTH;\\ntextBounds = viewFrame;\\ntextBounds.OffsetTo(B_ORIGIN);\\ntextBounds.InsetBy(TEXT_INSET, TEXT_INSET);\\nfTextView = new BTextView(viewFrame, \"MyTextView\", textBounds,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, B_WILL_DRAW);\\nfScrollView = new BScrollView(\"MyScrollView\", fTextView,\\nB_FOLLOW_ALL, 0, false, true);\\nAddChild(fScrollView);\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nFinally, the Save file panel is created and the window displayed:\\nfSavePanel = new BFilePanel(B_SAVE_PANEL, BMessenger(this), NULL,\\nB_FILE_NODE, false);\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nUnlike the creation of the Open file panel, the creation of the Save file panel\\nrequires that a few parameters be passed to the BFilePanel constructor. You\\nalready know that the first BFilePanel argument, mode, establishes the type of\\npanel to be created. The other parameters are worthy of a little explanation.\\nThe second argument, target, is used to define the target of the message the system will deliver to the application in response to the user\\'s dismissal of the panel.\\nThe default target is the application object, which works well for the Open file\\npanel. That\\'s because the Open file panel affects the application, and is referenced by an application data member. The Save file panel, on the other hand,\\naffects the window, and is referenced by a window data member. So I want the\\nmessage sent to the window object rather than the application object. Passing\\nBMessenger with the window object as the target makes that happen. There\\'s no\\nneed to preface BMessenger() with new, as the BFilePanel constructor handles\\nthe task of allocating memory for the message.\\nThe other argument that needs to be set is the fifth one--allow_multiple_\\nselection. Before passing a value for the fifth argument, I need to supply values\\nfor the third and fourth arguments. The third argument, panel_directory, specifies the directory to list in the Open file panel when that panel is first displayed.\\nPassing a value of NULL here keeps the default behavior of displaying the current\\nworking directory. The fourth argument, node_flavors, is used to specify the\\ntype of items considered to be valid user selections. The Be-defined constant\\nB_FILE_NODE is the default flavor--it specifies that a file (as opposed to, say, a\\ndirectory) is considered an acceptable user choice. The argument I\\'m really interested in is the fifth one--allow_multiple_selection. The default value for this\\nargument is true. FileBase doesn\\'t support the simultaneous opening of multiple\\nfiles, so a value of false needs to be passed here.\\nFileBase terminates when the user closes a window. As you\\'ve seen before, that\\naction results in the hook function QuitRequested() being invoked:\\nbool MyHelloWindow::QuitRequested()\\n{\\nbe_app->PostMessage(B_QUIT_REQUESTED);\\nreturn(true);\\n}\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nAn application-defined message is issued in response to the user choosing Save As\\nfrom the File menu. In response to that message, the program shows the alreadycreated Save file panel by invoking the BFilePanel function Show().\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG:\\nfSavePanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nSaving a File\\nConverting FileBase to a program that fully supports file saving is a straightforward process. No changes are needed in the MyHelloApplication class. The\\nMyHelloWindow class needs one new member function, a routine that implements the saving of a window\\'s data to a file in response to the user\\'s dismissing\\nthe Save file panel. The SaveAsFile example program adds that one function--the\\nSave() routine holds the code that implements the saving of a document\\'s text to\\ndisk. So the class declaration now contains a public declaration of Save():\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nstatus_t\\nprivate:\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nSave(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhen a Save file panel is dismissed, the system sends a B_SAVE_REQUESTED message to the affected application. This message is directed to the\\nMessageReceived() function of the Save file panel\\'s target. Recall that in the\\nFileBase program the second parameter passed to the BFilePanel constructor\\nspecified that the window be the target of the Save file panel. So the window\\'s\\nimplementation of MessageReceived() receives the message. Embedded in this\\nmessage is the pathname at which the file is to be saved. MessageReceived()\\npasses this information on to the application-defined routine Save():\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)\\n{\\nswitch(message->what)\\n{\\ncase MENU_FILE_SAVEAS_MSG:\\nfSavePanel->Show();\\nbreak;\\ncase B_SAVE_REQUESTED:\\nSave(message);\\nbreak;\\ndefault:\\nBWindow::MessageReceived(message);\\n}\\n}\\n\\nOn the following pages we\\'ll look first at saving a file using POSIX, then at saving\\na file with the Storage Kit.\\nUsing POSIX to save a file\\nTo work with files, you can use either the BFile class or a POSIX file of type\\nFILE. Here file-saving will be performed using the FILE type--see the sections\\n\"Using the Storage Kit to save a file\" and \"Opening a File,\" for examples of working with the BFile class.\\nThe Save() function begins with a number of local variable declarations. Each is\\ndescribed as it\\'s encountered in the Save() routine:\\nstatus_t MyHelloWindow::Save(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nentry_ref\\nref;\\nconst char *name;\\nBPath\\npath;\\nBEntry\\nentry;\\nstatus_t\\nerr = B_OK;\\nFILE\\n*f;\\n\\nThe message received by MessageReceived() and passed on to Save() has a\\nwhat field of B_SAVE_REQUESTED, a directory field that holds an entry_ref,\\nand a name field that holds the user-entered filename string describing a single\\nentry in a directory. The directory field\\'s entry_ref structure points to the\\ndirectory to which the user specified the file is to be saved. Invoking the\\nBMessage function FindRef() strips out this reference and saves it to the entry_\\nref variable ref:\\nif (err = message->FindRef(\"directory\", &ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nNext, the filename is retrieved from the message. The BMessage function\\nFindString() saves the message\\'s name field to the string variable name:\\nif (err = message->FindString(\"name\", &name) != B_OK) {\\nreturn err;\\n\\nThe next several steps are performed to get the directory and name into a form\\nthat can be passed to a file-opening routine. Recall that a file consists of an entry\\n(a location) and a node (data). The entry can be represented by an entry_ref or\\na BEntry object. Currently the entry is in the form of an entry_ref. Here the\\nentry is stored in a BEntry object. The BEntry function SetTo() handles that\\ntask:\\nif (err = entry.SetTo(&ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nA BPath object normalizes a pathname. That is, it reformats a pathname to clean it\\nup by, say, excluding a trailing slash (such as /boot/myDir/). The BEntry function GetPath() is used to store the BEntry information as a BPath object. Here\\nthe BPath object path is first set to the directory, then the filename is appended\\nto the directory:\\nentry.GetPath(&path);\\npath.Append(name);\\n\\nThe somewhat convoluted journey from the message\\'s entry_ref to a BEntry\\nobject to a BPath object is complete. Now the file directory and name appear\\ntogether in a form that can be used in the POSIX file opening function fopen():\\nif (!(f = fopen(path.Path(), \"w\")))\\nreturn B_ERROR;\\n\\nWith a new file opened, it\\'s safe to write the window\\'s data. The POSIX file function fwrite() can be used for that job. The data to write is the text of the window\\'s text view. That text is retrieved by calling the BTextView function Text().\\nThe number of bytes the text occupies can be obtained from the BTextView function TextLength(). After writing the data to the file, call the POSIX file function\\nfclose():\\nerr = fwrite(fTextView->Text(), 1, fTextView->TextLength(), f);\\nfclose(f);\\nreturn err;\\n}\\n\\nUsing the Storage Kit to save a file\\nUsing POSIX is straightforward, but so too is using the Storage Kit. Here I\\'ll modify the previous section\\'s version of the application-defined Save() function so\\nthat saving the file is done with a reliance on the Storage Kit rather than on\\nPOSIX:\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nstatus_t MyHelloWindow::Save(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nentry_ref\\nref;\\nconst char *name;\\nstatus_t\\nerr;\\n\\nThe ref and name variables are again declared for use in determining the directory to save the file to and the name to give that file. The err variable is again\\npresent for use in error checking. Gone are the BPath variable path, the BEntry\\nvariable entry, and the FILE variable f.\\nThe above code is unchanged from the previous version of Save(). First,\\nFindRef() is used to strip the directory in which the file should be saved from\\nthe message that was passed to Save(). Then FindString() is invoked to\\nretrieve the filename from the same message:\\nif (err =\\nreturn\\nif (err =\\nreturn\\n\\nmessage->FindRef(\"directory\", &ref) != B_OK)\\nerr;\\nmessage->FindString(\"name\", &name) != B_OK) {\\nerr;\\n\\nNow comes some new code. The location to which the file is to be saved is contained in the entry_ref variable ref. This variable is used as the argument in the\\ncreation of a BDirectory object. To ensure that the initialization of the new directory was successful, call the inherited BNode function InitCheck():\\nBDirectory dir(&ref);\\nif (err = dir.InitCheck() != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nA BFile object can be used to open an existing file or to create and open a new\\nfile. Here we need to create a new file. Passing the directory, filename, and an\\nopen mode does the trick. The open mode value is a combination of flags that\\nindicate such factors as whether the file is to have read and/or write permission\\nand whether a new file is to be created if one doesn\\'t already exist in the specified directory. After creating the new file, invoke the BFile version of\\nInitCheck() to verify that file creation was successful:\\nBFile file(&dir, name, B_READ_WRITE | B_CREATE_FILE);\\nif (err = file.InitCheck() != B_OK)\\nreturn err;\\n\\nWith a new file opened, it\\'s time to write the window\\'s data. Instead of the POSIX\\nfile function fwrite(), here I use the BFile function Write(). The first argument is the text to write to the file, while the second argument specifies the number of bytes to write. Both of the BView functions Text() and TextLength()\\nwere described in the POSIX example of file saving. After the data is written\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nthere\\'s no need to explicitly close the file--a file is automatically closed when its\\nBFile object is deleted (which occurs when the Save() function exits):\\nerr = file.Write(fTextView->Text(), fTextView->TextLength());\\nreturn err;\\n}\\n\\nOpening a File\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to save a file\\'s data using Be classes to work with the file\\'s\\npath and standard POSIX functions for performing the actual data writing. Here I\\'ll\\ndispense with the POSIX and go with the BFile class. The last example, SaveAsFile, was derived from the FileBase program. I\\'ll carry on with the example by\\nnow adding to the SaveAsFile code such that the OpenSaveAsFile example\\nbecomes capable of both saving a text file (using the already developed POSIX\\nfile-saving code) and opening a text file (using the BFile class).\\nWhen an Open file panel is dismissed, the system responds by sending the application a B_REFS_RECEIVED message that specifies which file or files are to be\\nopened. Rather than appearing at the target\\'s MessageReceived() routine,\\nthough, this message is sent to the target\\'s RefsReceived() function. The Open\\nfile panel indicates that the application is the panel\\'s target, so a RefsReceived()\\nfunction needs to be added to the application class:\\nclass MyHelloApplication : public BApplication {\\npublic:\\nvirtual void\\nvirtual void\\nprivate:\\nMyHelloWindow\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloApplication();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nRefsReceived(BMessage *message);\\n\\n*fMyWindow;\\n*fOpenPanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nThe implementation of RefsReceived() begins with the declaration of a few\\nlocal variables:\\nvoid MyHelloApplication::RefsReceived(BMessage *message)\\n{\\nBRect\\naRect;\\nref_num;\\nentry_ref ref;\\nstatus_t\\nerr;\\n\\nThe rectangle aRect defines the boundaries of the window to open:\\n\\x0cUsing Standard Open and Save Panels\\n\\n\\nThe integer ref_num serves as a loop counter. While the Open file panel used in\\nthe OpenSaveAsFile example allows for only one file selection at a time, the program might be adapted later to allow for multiple file selections in the Open file\\npanel. Creating a loop that opens each file is an easy enough task, so I\\'ll prepare\\nfor a program change by implementing the loop now:\\nref_num = 0;\\ndo {\\nif (err = message->FindRef(\"refs\", ref_num, &ref) != B_OK)\\nreturn;\\nnew MyHelloWindow(aRect, &ref);\\nref_num++;\\n} while (1);\\n}\\n\\nThe message received by RefsReceived() has a what field of B_REFS_RECEIVED\\nand a refs field that holds an entry_ref for each selected file. Invoking the\\nBMessage function FindRef() strips out one reference and saves it to the entry_\\nref variable ref. The ref_num parameter serves as an index to the refs array of\\nentry_refs. After the last entry is obtained (which will be after the first and only\\nentry in this example), an error occurs, breaking the otherwise infinite do-while\\nloop.\\nWith an entry obtained, a new window is created. Note that the MyHelloWindow\\nconstructor now receives two parameters: the boundary-defining rectangle the\\nconstructor always has, and a new entry_ref parameter that specifies the location of the file to open. Rather than change the existing constructor, the\\nMyHelloWindow class now defines two constructors: the original and the new\\ntwo-argument version:\\nclass MyHelloWindow : public BWindow {\\npublic:\\n\\nvirtual bool\\nvirtual void\\nstatus_t\\nprivate:\\nvoid\\nBMenuBar\\nBTextView\\nBScrollView\\nBFilePanel\\n\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame);\\nMyHelloWindow(BRect frame, entry_ref *ref);\\nQuitRequested();\\nMessageReceived(BMessage *message);\\nSave(BMessage *message);\\n\\nInitializeWindow(void);\\n*fMenuBar;\\n*fTextView;\\n*fScrollView;\\n*fSavePanel;\\n\\n};\\n\\nWhen the program is to create a new, empty window, the original\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is called. When the program needs to instead create a\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nnew window that is to hold the contents of an existing file, the new\\nMyHelloWindow constructor is invoked.\\nThe two MyHelloWindow constructors will create similar windows: each will be\\nthe same size, have the same menubar, and so forth. So the two constructors share\\nquite a bit of common code. To avoid writing redundant code, the\\nMyHelloWindow class now defines a new routine that holds this common code.\\nEach constructor invokes this new InitializeWindow() routine. The fileopening version of the MyHelloWindow constructor then goes on to implement\\nfile handling.\\nNote in the above-listed MyHelloWindow class that the InitializeWindow()\\nroutine is declared private. It will be invoked only by other MyHelloWindow\\nmember functions, so there\\'s no need to allow outside access to it. Because all of\\nthe code from the original version of the MyHelloWindow constructor, with the\\nexception of the last line (the call to Show()), was moved wholesale to the\\nInitializeWindow() routine, there\\'s no need to show the entire listing for this\\nnew function. Instead, a summary is offered below. To see the actual code, refer\\nback to the walk-through of the MyHelloWindow constructor in this chapter\\'s \"The\\nFile-Handling Base Project\" section.\\nvoid MyHelloWindow::InitializeWindow( void )\\n{\\n// menu code\\n// text view code\\n// Save file panel code\\n}\\n\\nAlmost all of the code found in the original version of the MyHelloWindow constructor has been moved to InitializeWindow(), so the original, one-argument\\nversion of the constructor shrinks to this:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nInitializeWindow();\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nThe new two-argument version of the constructor begins similarly:\\nMyHelloWindow::MyHelloWindow(BRect frame, entry_ref *ref)\\n: BWindow(frame, \"My Hello\", B_TITLED_WINDOW, B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)\\n{\\nInitializeWindow();\\n\\x0cOnward\\n\\n\\nWith the window set up, it\\'s on to the file-opening code. In the file-saving example, standard POSIX functions were used. Here a BFile object and BFile functions are instead used--beginning with the declaration of a BFile object:\\nBFile\\n\\nfile;\\n\\nThe second parameter passed to this MyHelloWindow constructor is the entry_\\nref for the file to open. That ref variable is used in a call to the BFile function\\nSetTo() to assign the BFile object a file to open. With the successful assignment of a file to open, it\\'s on to the actual file-opening. That begins with the declaration of a couple of variables:\\nif (file.SetTo(ref, B_READ_ONLY) == B_OK)\\n{\\noff_t\\nlength;\\nchar\\n*text;\\n\\nThe size of the file to open is determined, and returned, by the BFile function\\nGetSize():\\nfile.GetSize(&length);\\n\\nSufficient memory is allocated for the file\\'s contents by a call to malloc():\\ntext = (char *) malloc(length);\\n\\nNow it\\'s time to read the file\\'s data. The BFile function Read() handles that\\nchore. The data is text, so it\\'s saved to the character pointer text. Invoking the\\nBTextView function SetText() sets the text of the window\\'s text view to the\\nread-in text, while a call to free() releases from memory the no-longer-needed\\nfile data. With the window set up and the text view holding the data to display,\\nthere\\'s nothing left to do but display the window with a call to Show():\\nif (text && (file.Read(text, length) >= B_OK))\\nfTextView->SetText(text, length);\\nfree(text);\\n}\\nShow();\\n}\\n\\nOnward\\nThis chapter\\'s OpenSaveAsFile example is the most complete program in this\\nbook--it actually does something quite useful! Using the techniques presented in\\nthe preceding chapters, you should be able to turn OpenSaveAsFile into a realworld application. Begin by polishing up the File menu. Add a New item--that\\nrequires just a few lines of code. Also add a Quit item to provide a more graceful\\nmeans of exiting the program. Chapter 8 covered text editing in detail--use that\\nchapter\\'s techniques to add a complete, functioning Edit menu. Those changes will\\n\\x0c\\nChapter 10: Files\\n\\nresult in a useful, functional text editor. If you want to develop a program that\\'s\\nmore graphics-oriented, go ahead--Chapter 4, Windows, Views, and Messages, and\\nChapter 5, Drawing, hold the information to get you started. If you take that route,\\nthen you can always include the text-editing capabilities covered here and in\\nChapter 8 as a part of your program. For example, a graphics-oriented application\\ncould include a built-in text editor that allows the user to enter and save notes.\\nRegardless of the type of application you choose to develop, check out Be\\'s web\\nsite at http://www.be.com/.
