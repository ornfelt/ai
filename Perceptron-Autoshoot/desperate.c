--------------------------------------------------

    This is a simplified version that only uses
    pre-computed weights designed to target only
    the aqua blue bones model.

    This is created to only run on Linux under X11.

    Tested using the ioQuake3 client.
    https://ioquake3.org/
    
    This is the only version that uses only the float
    type; why? well the resolution of each pixel colour
    fits perfectly within the quantization of a float.

    If you only intend to play FFA and target the aqua
    blue bones model, then this is the fastest and most
    accurate version. Probably best compiled with clang.
