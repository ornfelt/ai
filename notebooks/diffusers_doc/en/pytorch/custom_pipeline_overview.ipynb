    "Community pipelines are any [DiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/overview#diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) class that are different from the original implementation as specified in their paper (for example, the [StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/controlnet#diffusers.StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline) corresponds to the [Text-to-Image Generation with ControlNet Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543) paper). They provide additional functionality or extend the original implementation of a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many cool community pipelines like [Speech to Image](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community#speech-to-image) or [Composable Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community#composable-stable-diffusion), and you can find all the official community pipelines [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community).\n",
    "\n",
    "To load any community pipeline on the Hub, pass the repository id of the community pipeline to the `custom_pipeline` argument and the model repository where you'd like to load the pipeline weights and components from. For example, the example below loads a dummy pipeline from [`hf-internal-testing/diffusers-dummy-pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/hf-internal-testing/diffusers-dummy-pipeline/blob/main/pipeline.py) and the pipeline weights and components from [`google/ddpm-cifar10-32`](https://huggingface.co/google/ddpm-cifar10-32):\n",
